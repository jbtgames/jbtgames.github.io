Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels down through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the entire preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, they are 56-78 (.418)."}

California Highway Patrol officers responded at about 10:40 p.m. to an unrelated car crash involving multiple vehicles on the northbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101, closing four of the six lanes to investigate, the agency said in a news release. When they reopened the lanes about an hour later, they saw a Range Rover SUV stopped in the road, south of the crash. Officers saw Pierce asleep at the wheel and \"noticed signs of alcohol impairment,\" so they conducted a DUI investigation, the press release said. He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, which will be reviewed by the Los Angeles city attorney. Pierce did not immediately respond to a message for comment, and additional contact information for him could not be immediately found. Pierce played for the Boston Celtics for 15 seasons, and most recently for LA Clippers before retiring in 2017. He also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards. The 10-time All-Star and the MVP of the 2008 NBA Finals was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go. It's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day by day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter. \"I've communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love, that the moment I step on this court or in this facility, I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I'm locked into whatever I have in front of me.

The Bucks next host the Pistons on Thursday in Milwaukee. \"I'm locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I'm locked in to this team. I'm locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.\" He went on to compare the offseason to a \"temptation\" period, but now that training camp has started, he's been off social media and focused on his craft. \"It's temptation. That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision.

(1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How much better did Luka Dončić's Lakers get?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-much-better-did-luka-doncics-lakers-get/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T15:52:35+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Lakers, who are in transition", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover.

Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024.

Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , Ayton is the wild card, especially considering his play in the Lakers' first two preseason games. After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31.

[ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer. Fewer shots mean fewer spike games, and that’s detrimental in formats where ceiling outcomes give you the best opportunity to win."}

A fan who spent hundreds of dollars for tickets to what he thought would be one of LeBron James ' final NBA games is looking to recoup the money in small claims court after it turned out \"The Second Decision\" teased by the Lakers superstar had nothing to do with his retirement.

He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat. Garcia said he purchased the tickets within 10 minutes of James' social media post. \"I was like, 'Holy s—, LeBron is going to retire! We've got to get tickets now,'\" the 29-year-old Garcia said. \"Like, literally, because if he formally makes this announcement, you know, there's gonna be some significant price changes, right?\" Read more: Shaikin: Dodgers hope a very, very rested hometown hero can pitch them into NLCS Garcia is a huge fan of the Lakers and James, as well as an avid basketball fan in general, so he thought it would be cool to see the NBA's all-time leading scorer play for the last time against the team he started his career with and brought its first title in 2016 after his return from Miami. \"Moments like that, I understand the value,\" Garcia said. \"There still may be some moderate value [to the tickets], however it's not the same without him retiring. I remember Kobe's last year, it was kind of what this would have been, per se, where every ticket was worth a lot. Every game had value. … \"I missed out on that. I was a little bit younger at the time. I obviously wasn't in a position to where I could just buy tickets unfortunately at that age. I believe I was like 18 or 19 at the time. And that's one of my biggest regrets as a sports fan. I really wish I could have gotten to Kobe's last year. So I see this as a potential to kind of make up for what I lost with Kobe.\" But \"The Second Decision\" ended up having nothing to do with retirement. It was merely a Hennessy ad . So now Garcia wants his money back.

So that's why I was really thinking, 'You know what, this might be grounds for a case.'\" A trial date has been set for Dec. 1. The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though. Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters at practice Tuesday that the organization hadn't been at all concerned about the meaning behind James' post the previous day.

Garcia said he didn't care what others might think about him jumping to the wrong conclusion or his effort to recoup the funds he spent after doing so. \"If I was the type of individual that was bothered by people's comments or reactions, would I have filed a small-claims lawsuit against LeBron James?\" Garcia said. \"I'm getting reactions. I mean, have you read some of these social media comments? I don't care. I am a very chill guy. ... I'm getting set to take on one of the most famous people in the world. I know what comes with that.\" In light of everything that has happened this week, though, Garcia said he'd still be willing to pay the same amount of money to see James play during his eventual retirement tour. \"Of course,\" Garcia said. \"I would probably spend more, because life is all about memories and experiences.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over. (Just not, like, as an actual bet with actual money.) East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26. Patrick Ewing (11,607) (James grabbed 546 rebounds last season. He trails Rodman by 223.) 1. John Stockton (15,806) 2. Chris Paul (12,499) 3. Jason Kidd (12,091) 4. LeBron James (11,584) 5. Steve Nash (10,335) (James doled out 575 assists last season. He trails Kidd by 507.) 3. Jason Kidd (2,684) 4. Michael Jordan (2,514) 5. Gary Payton (2,445) 6. LeBron James (2,345) 7. Maurice Cheeks (2,310) (James swiped 70 steals last season. He trails Payton by 100.) 4. Damian Lillard (2,804) 5. Klay Thompson (2,697) 6. Reggie Miller (2,560) 7. LeBron James (2,559) 8. Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets.

Fantasy basketball season is here, and the best way to prep for your drafts is to mock, mock again and mock some more! Drafting out of the No. 12 spot in a 12-team, 9-cat league offers the benefit of back-to-back picks to start your build, but it comes with its own set of challenges. The top-tier players have been selected, and your two picks will be the only ones you have until your next two picks nearly two full rounds later. I completed a mock drafting from this spot to show how it might play out. Here are the results and brief analysis. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , 1. Nikola Jokić (DEN - C) 2. Victor Wembanyama (SAS - C) 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL - PF,C) 4. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC - PG) 5. Luka Dončić (LAL - PG,SG) 6.

Jalen Johnson (ATL - SF,PF) Drafting from the 12 spot with back-to-back picks, my options are wide open, but there is some strategy involved here. With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27. Scottie Barnes (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 28. Jaylen Brown (BOS - SG,SF) 29. Josh Giddey (CHI - PG,SG) 30. Pascal Siakam (IND - PF,C) 31. Jamal Murray (DEN - PG,SG) 32. Bam Adebayo (MIA - PF,C) 33. Derrick White (BOS - PG,SG) 34. Franz Wagner (ORL - SF,PF) 35. Ivica Zubac (LAC - C) 36. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 37. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 38. De'Aaron Fox (SAS - PG,SG) 39. Desmond Bane (ORL - SG,SF) 40. Trey Murphy III (NOP - SF,PF) 41. Jaren Jackson Jr. (MEM - PF,C) 42. Kawhi Leonard (LAC - SF,PF) 43. Dyson Daniels (ATL - PG,SG,SF) 44. Deni Avdija (POR - SF,PF) 45. Jimmy Butler III (GSW - SF,PF) 46. Ja Morant (MEM - PG) 47. Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 48. Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56. DeMar DeRozan (SAC - SF) 57. Josh Hart (NYK - SG,SF,PF) 58. Jalen Duren (DET - C) 59. Walker Kessler (UTA - C) 60. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 61. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 62. Jarrett Allen (CLE - C) 63. Zach LaVine (SAC - PG,SG) 64. Darius Garland (CLE - PG) 65. Coby White (CHI - PG,SG) 66. Paul George (PHI - SG,SF,PF) 67. Payton Pritchard (BOS - PG) 68. OG Anunoby (NYK - SF,PF) 69. Brandon Ingram (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 70. Isaiah Hartenstein (OKC - C) 71. Rudy Gobert (MIN - C) 72. Immanuel Quickley (TOR - PG,SG) The purpose of mock drafts is to learn. Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76. Julius Randle (MIN - PF,C) 77. Michael Porter Jr. (BKN - SF,PF) 78. Norman Powell (MIA - SG,SF) 79. Anfernee Simons (BOS - PG,SG) 80. Bradley Beal (LAC - SG,SF) 81. Jrue Holiday (POR - PG,SG) 82. Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 83. Jalen Green (PHX - PG,SG) 84. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 85. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 86. Christian Braun (DEN - SG,SF) 87. Donovan Clingan (POR - C) 88. Matas Buzelis (CHI - SF,PF) 89. Mark Williams (PHX - C) 90. Bennedict Mathurin (IND - SG,SF) 91. Cameron Johnson (DEN - SF,PF) 92. John Collins (LAC - PF,C) 93. RJ Barrett (TOR - SF,PF) 94. Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (ATL - SG,SF) 111. Keegan Murray (SAC - SF,PF) 112. Dereck Lively II (DAL - C) 113. CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) 114. Zach Edey (MEM - C) 115. Aaron Gordon (DEN - PF,C) 116. Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night. Adding that nearly double-digit rebound total and 2.7 stocks per game could have Thompson looking like a top-10 player this season. Other Players in Consideration: Tyrese Maxey, PHI (ADP: 19.9) Alperen Sengun, HOU (ADP: 19.6) Evan Mobley, CLE (ADP: 20.1) LaMelo Ball (ADP: 29.7)"}

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told The Athletic's Nick Friedell in an exclusive interview. “How can I have their trust? And they can go to [owner] Joe [Lacob] and [general manager] Mike [Dunleavy] and be like, “Hey, we want to leave it with him. He’s going to continue what we’re leaving. \"So, I think about that all time, and I set myself up in that position to have that. And there’s a lot of other things than just skill that you need to be in that position.” There has been much chatter about life after Steph, and what that could look like. Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The light that gauges the effectiveness of their perimeter defense, particularly at the point of attack. That element is one of several essentials to Golden State’s success, and it has been considerably less than stellar. Opposing guards, some speedy and others shifty, are penetrating with regularity, resulting in paint points, free throws or kickouts to open shooters behind the arc. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! That was visible Wednesday night in the first half – with all minutes going to starters and rotation players – of a 129-123 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. It took a massive fourth-quarter comeback by the far end of the bench to wipe out a 16-point halftime deficit. Moses Moody started in the role of primary POA defender against Portland, with coach Steve Kerr pairing him with Stephen Curry in the backcourt. This vulnerability also was visible last Sunday, when Brandin Podziemski started alongside Curry in a 111-103 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. While it’s unreasonable to expect fantastic defense in the first week of the preseason, the Warriors can’t be delighted with a defense that allowed 39 points in the first quarter and 73 in the half. “They were flying by us,” Kerr said. “And then we were collapsing, probably too much. And then they had a ton of threes. I think they made 10 threes in the first half.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Wrong, coach. The Blazers drained 12 triples in the first half. They also posted a 24-16 edge in paint points. This was Golden State’s first look at a starting lineup that might start the 2025-26 NBA regular season. Curry and Moody in the backcourt, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at forward and Al Horford at center . All five posted negative plus/minus numbers in the first half. “I didn’t think we were ready to play,” Kerr said. “I don’t know that we got a good enough look at that lineup to really know. It should fit, with Al’s shooting and we have a lot of length. Moses on the ball. They took it to us right away.” Starting Moody against the Blazers was logical because he’s a rangy defender (6-foot-5, 7-foot wingspan) and a good 3-point shooter. The possibility of him as lead bird dog emerged late last season, after the Warriors traded Andrew Wiggins as part of the deal to acquire Jimmy Butler III, as Kerr explained before tipoff. “He got to guard the ball,” Kerr recalled of Moody. “He got to be in the starting lineup, and he became our point of attack defender, like Wiggs was before. And so, with Wiggs leaving, that opened a void on this team, because Jimmy's not that.” Moody has the potential to be all of that, but it’s clear he’s still trying to master the art of staying in front of quick guards. It’s a tough assignment. He has made 74 starts over four NBA seasons, but starring in that role took Klay Thompson about 300 starts. “They came out and hit us early,” Moody told NBC Sports Bay Area. “It felt like a different game than [against the Lakers]. \"We didn’t do much game planning and preparation. But I think their speed, especially in transition, got us.” Portland guard Shaedon Sharpe finished with a game-high 22 points in 23 minutes, on 9-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-8 from deep. He was plus-14 for the night. Backup guard Blake Wesley, blasting into the paint with relative ease, finished with nine points and six rebounds. Three nights earlier, four Lakers scored in double figures on Sunday – and all were guards: Gabe Vincent (team-high 16 points), Dalton Knecht (12), R.J. Davis (11) and Jack LaRavia (10). Along with their 49 combined points, they accounted for 12 assists. Golden State’s POA defense so important because there is no Victor Wembanyama waiting at the rim. There is no Anthony Davis or Rudy Gobert or Chet Holmgren. Not even a Donovan Clingan The preseason is a time for experimenting, for seeing what might work and what shouldn’t even be tried. It’s a work in progress, and there is plenty of time to patch it. But the early returns are worth watching. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Warriors again play the Blazers in the preseason next Tuesday, as well as the third game of the 2025-26 NBA regular season in what will be the second night of a back-to-back. Here are three takeaways from the Warriors’ second win to start their five-game preseason schedule. After opening the preseason with a small-ball lineup in the Warriors' first game , coach Steve Kerr switched gears and went big against the Blazers. Al Horford moved into the starting lineup, with the real decision being Moses Moody staying and Brandin Podziemski coming off the bench. Horford and Moody accompanied Curry, Butler and Green. “Al gives us the ability to play bigger with shooting,” Kerr explained at his pregame press conference. “Portland’s got a pretty big team and I would anticipate they’ll start [Donovan] Clingan. I think I mentioned last game, I don’t want to throw Draymond out there constantly against these big centers. So this is a good night to take a look at that lineup and see what we do.” The Warriors trailed 18-15 when Kerr first turned to his bench, replacing Moody and Horford with Buddy Hield and Post with a little more than five minutes left in the first quarter. Moody blocked two shots in the first minute, and Horford already had two rebounds and one assist. He should have had two assists by then if Moody would have converted an open layup. But Horford’s first assist was an eye-opening dime. The 39-year-old center grabbed a defensive rebound and went coast-to-coast, finding Butler in transition for an easy layup at the rim. Al Horford doing this as a 39-year-old center is absurd pic.twitter.com/UCi79KK6Br The starters didn’t play together again all night. Like the preseason opener, Curry, Butler, Green and Horford all sat the second half. Horford was scoreless in 11 minutes while missing his four shot attempts. Moody didn’t start the second half and was a minus-10 in 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. Once Kerr turned to his bench, the game flipped in favor of the Blazers. The Warriors used a 10-man rotation in the first quarter, using Podziemski, Hield, Post, Jonathan Kuminga and Gary Payton II off the bench. That unit lost its run 19-4 in the first quarter alone. The Blazers’ bench outscored the Warriors’ reserves 18-7 in the first quarter, and Portland went on a 13-0 run to hold a 14-point 39-25 lead going into the second quarter. By halftime, the Warriors were losing the bench battle 25-20. All of the Warriors’ bench players had a negative plus/minus, and Deni Avdija, who was up to 13 points, was the lone Blazers bench player in the negative. Seth Curry eventually will be an option off the bench for Kerr, and should at least provide more outside shooting. Curry “is still ramping up,” per Kerr, and has yet to play in the preseason. He will be waived by Oct. 18 and is eligible to be re-signed starting Nov. 11. Podziemski and Kuminga each were a game-low minus-17. If Toumani Camara starts making threes like he did against the Warriors, the rest of the league could have a problem on its hands. The Second Team All-Defensive selection from last season was part of the reason the Warriors were buried from long distance on their home court. Camara went 4 of 7 from 3-point range in the first half before missing his two attempts in the second half. Shaedon Sharpe also was 4 of 7 beyond the arc in the first half as the Blazers went 12 of 28 on threes through the first two quarters. The Warriors were losing the long distance battle, and were being beaten by speed. Most of the Blazers’ threes were open shots, and the Warriors were late to rotate. The Blazers shot 46.3 percent in the first half, including a 42.9 3-point percentage. The Warriors also only had two steals compared to six by the Blazers going into halftime, and they turned the ball over three times more than them – 12 to three. Effort and resiliency from the back of the bench deserves tons of positivity. First, the defensive miscues will have to be cleaned up ahead of Sunday’s game in LA against the Lakers.

Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels down through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the entire preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, they are 56-78 (.418)."}

California Highway Patrol officers responded at about 10:40 p.m. to an unrelated car crash involving multiple vehicles on the northbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101, closing four of the six lanes to investigate, the agency said in a news release. When they reopened the lanes about an hour later, they saw a Range Rover SUV stopped in the road, south of the crash. Officers saw Pierce asleep at the wheel and \"noticed signs of alcohol impairment,\" so they conducted a DUI investigation, the press release said. He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, which will be reviewed by the Los Angeles city attorney. Pierce did not immediately respond to a message for comment, and additional contact information for him could not be immediately found. Pierce played for the Boston Celtics for 15 seasons, and most recently for LA Clippers before retiring in 2017. He also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards. The 10-time All-Star and the MVP of the 2008 NBA Finals was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision.

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later.

For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League. He is set to back up DeMar DeRozan , so presumably he wouldn't get enough minutes early on, but he's another free agent I'll have my eye on once the season begins.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year odds, picks: Best bets, from favorites to long shots", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-sixth-man-of-the-year-odds-picks-best-bets-from-favorites-to-long-shots/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T14:55:07+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "The Sixth Man of the Year race will be wide open in the 2025-26 season", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "Rockets' Kevin Durant opens up about possible reunion with ex-teammate Russell Westbrook: 'It would be dope'", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-kevin-durant-opens-up-about-possible-reunion-with-ex-teammate-russell-westbrook-it-would-be-dope/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T16:40:18+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 season, Westbrook remains a free agent", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How much better did Luka Dončić's Lakers get?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-much-better-did-luka-doncics-lakers-get/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T15:52:35+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Lakers, who are in transition", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Boston Celtics great Paul Pierce was reportedly arrested under suspicion of DUI in Los Angeles on Tuesday, California Highway Patrol told multiple news stations in California and Boston. Pierce, 47, was reportedly found sleeping behind the wheel of his car on a Los Angeles freeway after 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover. Officers claimed they noticed signs of impairment from Pierce and began a DUI investigation. He was arrested under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Pierce's case will be \"presented to the Los Angeles City Attorney for review,\" per WCVB. While Pierce spent nearly his entire NBA career in Boston, he was born — and grew up — in California. Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers.

James, 40, signed a new contract with the Lakers in June and is set to become the first player to play across 23 separate NBA seasons. Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career. His tally of 1,562 regular-season appearances is just 50 short of breaking former Boston Celtics star Robert Parish's NBA record. The four-time NBA champion featured in 70 of the Lakers' 82 games last term and played on 71 occasions in the year before.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , Ayton is the wild card, especially considering his play in the Lakers' first two preseason games. After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31. If the injury requires more time to heal, or James needs a few days to get back up to speed, he's at risk of missing even more time as he recovers from the injury. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer.

A fan who spent hundreds of dollars for tickets to what he thought would be one of LeBron James ' final NBA games is looking to recoup the money in small claims court after it turned out \"The Second Decision\" teased by the Lakers superstar had nothing to do with his retirement. Norwalk resident Andrew Garcia filed a claim Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court that states that James owes him $865.66 because of \"fraud, deception, misrepresentation, and any and all basis of legal recovery.\" Read more: Plaschke: LeBron James is 'maybe' retiring? This is going to be fun Garcia told The Times that he spent that amount for two tickets to the Lakers' game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 31, 2026, at Crypto.com Arena, thinking it would be the 40-year-old NBA icon's final game against the team that drafted him in 2003. He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat. Garcia said he purchased the tickets within 10 minutes of James' social media post. \"I was like, 'Holy s—, LeBron is going to retire! We've got to get tickets now,'\" the 29-year-old Garcia said. \"Like, literally, because if he formally makes this announcement, you know, there's gonna be some significant price changes, right?\" Read more: Shaikin: Dodgers hope a very, very rested hometown hero can pitch them into NLCS Garcia is a huge fan of the Lakers and James, as well as an avid basketball fan in general, so he thought it would be cool to see the NBA's all-time leading scorer play for the last time against the team he started his career with and brought its first title in 2016 after his return from Miami. \"Moments like that, I understand the value,\" Garcia said. \"There still may be some moderate value [to the tickets], however it's not the same without him retiring. I remember Kobe's last year, it was kind of what this would have been, per se, where every ticket was worth a lot. Every game had value. … \"I missed out on that. I was a little bit younger at the time. I obviously wasn't in a position to where I could just buy tickets unfortunately at that age. I believe I was like 18 or 19 at the time. And that's one of my biggest regrets as a sports fan. I really wish I could have gotten to Kobe's last year. So I see this as a potential to kind of make up for what I lost with Kobe.\" But \"The Second Decision\" ended up having nothing to do with retirement. It was merely a Hennessy ad . So now Garcia wants his money back. Read more: Natalia Bryant makes her debut as a creative director with Lakers short film \"There is no circumstance absent him saying he's gonna retire that I would have bought tickets that far in advance,\" Garcia said. \"I mean, I buy tickets, but I don't buy tickets five months in advance. I'm the kind of person that buys tickets five hours in advance. It was solely, solely, solely based on that. So that's why I was really thinking, 'You know what, this might be grounds for a case.'\" A trial date has been set for Dec. 1. The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though. Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters at practice Tuesday that the organization hadn't been at all concerned about the meaning behind James' post the previous day. Read more: Hernández: Why has Shohei Ohtani gone missing at the plate for the Dodgers? \"We all knew it was an ad,\" Redick said . Garcia said he didn't care what others might think about him jumping to the wrong conclusion or his effort to recoup the funds he spent after doing so. \"If I was the type of individual that was bothered by people's comments or reactions, would I have filed a small-claims lawsuit against LeBron James?\" Garcia said. \"I'm getting reactions. I mean, have you read some of these social media comments? I don't care. I am a very chill guy. ... I'm getting set to take on one of the most famous people in the world. I know what comes with that.\" In light of everything that has happened this week, though, Garcia said he'd still be willing to pay the same amount of money to see James play during his eventual retirement tour. \"Of course,\" Garcia said. \"I would probably spend more, because life is all about memories and experiences.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over. (Just not, like, as an actual bet with actual money.) East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26.

Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets. Stephen Curry (25,386 career points) could climb as high as 13th (27,313) on the all-time list. Nikola Jokić needs 18 triple-doubles to surpass Oscar Robertson for second on the all-time list. Klay Thompson needs 277 3-pointers to surpass Ray Allen for third on the all-time list. Paul George needs 102 3-pointers to surpass Kyle Korver for eighth on the all-time list. Durant needs 100 3-pointers to surpass Vince Carter for 10th on the all-time list. Chris Paul needs 57 games played to surpass Jason Terry for 10th on the all-time list. Rudy Gobert needs 300 rebounds to become the 45th player ever to reach 10,000 for his career. Anthony Davis needs 185 blocks to become the 21st player ever to reach 2,000 for his career. Davis and George need 1,022 points and 1,303 points, respectively, to reach 20,000 for their careers."}

With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27.

Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56.

Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76.

Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110.

Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night.

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told The Athletic's Nick Friedell in an exclusive interview. “How can I have their trust? And they can go to [owner] Joe [Lacob] and [general manager] Mike [Dunleavy] and be like, “Hey, we want to leave it with him. He’s going to continue what we’re leaving. \"So, I think about that all time, and I set myself up in that position to have that. And there’s a lot of other things than just skill that you need to be in that position.” There has been much chatter about life after Steph, and what that could look like. Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The light that gauges the effectiveness of their perimeter defense, particularly at the point of attack. That element is one of several essentials to Golden State’s success, and it has been considerably less than stellar. Opposing guards, some speedy and others shifty, are penetrating with regularity, resulting in paint points, free throws or kickouts to open shooters behind the arc. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! That was visible Wednesday night in the first half – with all minutes going to starters and rotation players – of a 129-123 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. It took a massive fourth-quarter comeback by the far end of the bench to wipe out a 16-point halftime deficit. Moses Moody started in the role of primary POA defender against Portland, with coach Steve Kerr pairing him with Stephen Curry in the backcourt. This vulnerability also was visible last Sunday, when Brandin Podziemski started alongside Curry in a 111-103 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. While it’s unreasonable to expect fantastic defense in the first week of the preseason, the Warriors can’t be delighted with a defense that allowed 39 points in the first quarter and 73 in the half. “They were flying by us,” Kerr said. “And then we were collapsing, probably too much. And then they had a ton of threes. I think they made 10 threes in the first half.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Wrong, coach. The Blazers drained 12 triples in the first half. They also posted a 24-16 edge in paint points. This was Golden State’s first look at a starting lineup that might start the 2025-26 NBA regular season. Curry and Moody in the backcourt, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at forward and Al Horford at center . All five posted negative plus/minus numbers in the first half. “I didn’t think we were ready to play,” Kerr said. “I don’t know that we got a good enough look at that lineup to really know. It should fit, with Al’s shooting and we have a lot of length. Moses on the ball. They took it to us right away.” Starting Moody against the Blazers was logical because he’s a rangy defender (6-foot-5, 7-foot wingspan) and a good 3-point shooter. The possibility of him as lead bird dog emerged late last season, after the Warriors traded Andrew Wiggins as part of the deal to acquire Jimmy Butler III, as Kerr explained before tipoff. “He got to guard the ball,” Kerr recalled of Moody. “He got to be in the starting lineup, and he became our point of attack defender, like Wiggs was before. And so, with Wiggs leaving, that opened a void on this team, because Jimmy's not that.” Moody has the potential to be all of that, but it’s clear he’s still trying to master the art of staying in front of quick guards. It’s a tough assignment. He has made 74 starts over four NBA seasons, but starring in that role took Klay Thompson about 300 starts. “They came out and hit us early,” Moody told NBC Sports Bay Area. “It felt like a different game than [against the Lakers]. \"We didn’t do much game planning and preparation. But I think their speed, especially in transition, got us.” Portland guard Shaedon Sharpe finished with a game-high 22 points in 23 minutes, on 9-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-8 from deep. He was plus-14 for the night. Backup guard Blake Wesley, blasting into the paint with relative ease, finished with nine points and six rebounds. Three nights earlier, four Lakers scored in double figures on Sunday – and all were guards: Gabe Vincent (team-high 16 points), Dalton Knecht (12), R.J. Davis (11) and Jack LaRavia (10). Along with their 49 combined points, they accounted for 12 assists. Golden State’s POA defense so important because there is no Victor Wembanyama waiting at the rim. There is no Anthony Davis or Rudy Gobert or Chet Holmgren. Not even a Donovan Clingan The preseason is a time for experimenting, for seeing what might work and what shouldn’t even be tried. It’s a work in progress, and there is plenty of time to patch it. But the early returns are worth watching. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Warriors again play the Blazers in the preseason next Tuesday, as well as the third game of the 2025-26 NBA regular season in what will be the second night of a back-to-back. Here are three takeaways from the Warriors’ second win to start their five-game preseason schedule. After opening the preseason with a small-ball lineup in the Warriors' first game , coach Steve Kerr switched gears and went big against the Blazers. Al Horford moved into the starting lineup, with the real decision being Moses Moody staying and Brandin Podziemski coming off the bench. Horford and Moody accompanied Curry, Butler and Green. “Al gives us the ability to play bigger with shooting,” Kerr explained at his pregame press conference. “Portland’s got a pretty big team and I would anticipate they’ll start [Donovan] Clingan. I think I mentioned last game, I don’t want to throw Draymond out there constantly against these big centers. So this is a good night to take a look at that lineup and see what we do.” The Warriors trailed 18-15 when Kerr first turned to his bench, replacing Moody and Horford with Buddy Hield and Post with a little more than five minutes left in the first quarter. Moody blocked two shots in the first minute, and Horford already had two rebounds and one assist. He should have had two assists by then if Moody would have converted an open layup. But Horford’s first assist was an eye-opening dime. The 39-year-old center grabbed a defensive rebound and went coast-to-coast, finding Butler in transition for an easy layup at the rim. Al Horford doing this as a 39-year-old center is absurd pic.twitter.com/UCi79KK6Br The starters didn’t play together again all night. Like the preseason opener, Curry, Butler, Green and Horford all sat the second half. Horford was scoreless in 11 minutes while missing his four shot attempts. Moody didn’t start the second half and was a minus-10 in 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. Once Kerr turned to his bench, the game flipped in favor of the Blazers. The Warriors used a 10-man rotation in the first quarter, using Podziemski, Hield, Post, Jonathan Kuminga and Gary Payton II off the bench. That unit lost its run 19-4 in the first quarter alone. The Blazers’ bench outscored the Warriors’ reserves 18-7 in the first quarter, and Portland went on a 13-0 run to hold a 14-point 39-25 lead going into the second quarter. By halftime, the Warriors were losing the bench battle 25-20. All of the Warriors’ bench players had a negative plus/minus, and Deni Avdija, who was up to 13 points, was the lone Blazers bench player in the negative. Seth Curry eventually will be an option off the bench for Kerr, and should at least provide more outside shooting. Curry “is still ramping up,” per Kerr, and has yet to play in the preseason. He will be waived by Oct. 18 and is eligible to be re-signed starting Nov. 11. Podziemski and Kuminga each were a game-low minus-17. If Toumani Camara starts making threes like he did against the Warriors, the rest of the league could have a problem on its hands. The Second Team All-Defensive selection from last season was part of the reason the Warriors were buried from long distance on their home court. Camara went 4 of 7 from 3-point range in the first half before missing his two attempts in the second half. Shaedon Sharpe also was 4 of 7 beyond the arc in the first half as the Blazers went 12 of 28 on threes through the first two quarters. The Warriors were losing the long distance battle, and were being beaten by speed. Most of the Blazers’ threes were open shots, and the Warriors were late to rotate. The Blazers shot 46.3 percent in the first half, including a 42.9 3-point percentage. The Warriors also only had two steals compared to six by the Blazers going into halftime, and they turned the ball over three times more than them – 12 to three. Effort and resiliency from the back of the bench deserves tons of positivity. First, the defensive miscues will have to be cleaned up ahead of Sunday’s game in LA against the Lakers.

Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, the Lakers are 56-78 (.418)."}

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

Antetokounmpo's comments came in the wake of a report by ESPN's Shams Charania earlier this week that the Bucks engaged in trade discussions with the New York Knicks this offseason about a potential deal for the two-time MVP. Although Antetokounmpo acknowledged that he had not read the report, he again doubled down on his desire to compete for championships -- be it in Milwaukee or elsewhere. \"I've said this many times: I want to be in a situation that I can win,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go. It's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day by day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter. \"I've communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love, that the moment I step on this court or in this facility, I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I'm locked into whatever I have in front of me. Now, if in six, seven months I change my mind, I think that's human, too.\" After missing the beginning of training camp in Milwaukee with an illness, Antetokounmpo rejoined the team this past weekend in Miami before its first preseason game Sunday, although he did not play. The Bucks next host the Pistons on Thursday in Milwaukee. \"I'm locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I'm locked in to this team. I'm locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.\" He went on to compare the offseason to a \"temptation\" period, but now that training camp has started, he's been off social media and focused on his craft. \"It's temptation. That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision. And my decision today is that I'm here and I'm committed to this team.\""}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN.

For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Create or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today! Sign up today! Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League. He is set to back up DeMar DeRozan , so presumably he wouldn't get enough minutes early on, but he's another free agent I'll have my eye on once the season begins.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year odds, picks: Best bets, from favorites to long shots", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-sixth-man-of-the-year-odds-picks-best-bets-from-favorites-to-long-shots/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T14:55:07+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "The Sixth Man of the Year race will be wide open in the 2025-26 season", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Boston Celtics great Paul Pierce was reportedly arrested under suspicion of DUI in Los Angeles on Tuesday, California Highway Patrol told multiple news stations in California and Boston. Pierce, 47, was reportedly found sleeping behind the wheel of his car on a Los Angeles freeway after 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover. Officers claimed they noticed signs of impairment from Pierce and began a DUI investigation. He was arrested under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Pierce's case will be \"presented to the Los Angeles City Attorney for review,\" per WCVB. While Pierce spent nearly his entire NBA career in Boston, he was born — and grew up — in California. Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024. He found himself in the headlines in May, when he walked 20 miles to work after a bold prediction about the Celtics backfired."}

James, 40, signed a new contract with the Lakers in June and is set to become the first player to play across 23 separate NBA seasons. Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career. His tally of 1,562 regular-season appearances is just 50 short of breaking former Boston Celtics star Robert Parish's NBA record. The four-time NBA champion featured in 70 of the Lakers' 82 games last term and played on 71 occasions in the year before. Last season, James averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds per game and finished sixth in Most Valuable Player vote. The Lakers qualified for the play-offs in 2024-25 but lost 4-1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side.

Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31. If the injury requires more time to heal, or James needs a few days to get back up to speed, he's at risk of missing even more time as he recovers from the injury. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves. With James sidelined to start the 2025-26 NBA season, Dončić will look to carry an even bigger load early in the schedule."}

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer. Fewer shots mean fewer spike games, and that’s detrimental in formats where ceiling outcomes give you the best opportunity to win."}

He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat.

The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players. This report comes just days after USA Basketball announced that Duke coach Kara Lawson will coach the USA women’s national team for the next Olympic cycle and the Los Angeles Games.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over.

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26.

Maurice Cheeks (2,310) (James swiped 70 steals last season. He trails Payton by 100.) 4. Damian Lillard (2,804) 5. Klay Thompson (2,697) 6. Reggie Miller (2,560) 7. LeBron James (2,559) 8. Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets. Stephen Curry (25,386 career points) could climb as high as 13th (27,313) on the all-time list. Nikola Jokić needs 18 triple-doubles to surpass Oscar Robertson for second on the all-time list. Klay Thompson needs 277 3-pointers to surpass Ray Allen for third on the all-time list. Paul George needs 102 3-pointers to surpass Kyle Korver for eighth on the all-time list. Durant needs 100 3-pointers to surpass Vince Carter for 10th on the all-time list. Chris Paul needs 57 games played to surpass Jason Terry for 10th on the all-time list. Rudy Gobert needs 300 rebounds to become the 45th player ever to reach 10,000 for his career. Anthony Davis needs 185 blocks to become the 21st player ever to reach 2,000 for his career. Davis and George need 1,022 points and 1,303 points, respectively, to reach 20,000 for their careers."}

Jalen Johnson (ATL - SF,PF) Drafting from the 12 spot with back-to-back picks, my options are wide open, but there is some strategy involved here. With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27. Scottie Barnes (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 28. Jaylen Brown (BOS - SG,SF) 29. Josh Giddey (CHI - PG,SG) 30. Pascal Siakam (IND - PF,C) 31. Jamal Murray (DEN - PG,SG) 32. Bam Adebayo (MIA - PF,C) 33.

Jimmy Butler III (GSW - SF,PF) 46. Ja Morant (MEM - PG) 47. Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 48. Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56.

Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76. Julius Randle (MIN - PF,C) 77. Michael Porter Jr. (BKN - SF,PF) 78. Norman Powell (MIA - SG,SF) 79. Anfernee Simons (BOS - PG,SG) 80. Bradley Beal (LAC - SG,SF) 81. Jrue Holiday (POR - PG,SG) 82. Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 83. Jalen Green (PHX - PG,SG) 84. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 85. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 86. Christian Braun (DEN - SG,SF) 87. Donovan Clingan (POR - C) 88. Matas Buzelis (CHI - SF,PF) 89. Mark Williams (PHX - C) 90. Bennedict Mathurin (IND - SG,SF) 91. Cameron Johnson (DEN - SF,PF) 92. John Collins (LAC - PF,C) 93. RJ Barrett (TOR - SF,PF) 94. Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (ATL - SG,SF) 111. Keegan Murray (SAC - SF,PF) 112. Dereck Lively II (DAL - C) 113. CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) 114. Zach Edey (MEM - C) 115. Aaron Gordon (DEN - PF,C) 116. Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night. Adding that nearly double-digit rebound total and 2.7 stocks per game could have Thompson looking like a top-10 player this season. Other Players in Consideration: Tyrese Maxey, PHI (ADP: 19.9) Alperen Sengun, HOU (ADP: 19.6) Evan Mobley, CLE (ADP: 20.1) LaMelo Ball (ADP: 29.7)"}

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone.

Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

Here are the various pathways for LeBron and the Lakers for the 2025-26 campaign.", "body": "Brian Windhorst analyzes LeBron James' \"The Second Decision\" ad, and Shams Charania gives an update on James' glute injury. (1:48) The only signs of LeBron James inside the locker room an hour before the Los Angeles Lakers ' preseason opener tipped off in Palm Desert, California, last week were his gold No. 23 uniform hanging in his cubby and a triangular foam cushion placed on the seat beneath it. The jersey would not be needed on this night. The cushion would. Of the 42 players listed on the Lakers' and Phoenix Suns' training camp rosters, 22 were born in the 2000s and 19 were born in the 1990s. And one, James, was born in 1984 -- five months before Suns head coach Jordan Ott. The 40-year-old James didn't play in the exhibition game after being limited to light shooting through the first three days of training camp because of nerve irritation in his glute, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. The cushion, though, worked a full night, as his seat in the locker room and during the game at the end of the bench. When James eventually emerged in the locker room, wearing a T-shirt with the \"Forever King\" tagline from his latest Nike ad campaign printed on the front, he was asked by a reporter if he was ready to begin an unprecedented 23rd season. Before James could answer, Lakers guard Austin Reaves chimed in. \"You got another five seasons in you,\" he said. James' eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face. \"Why not six or seven, get to 30?\" the reporter continued. \"Yeah, set a record!\" Reaves added. James turned toward Reaves and smirked: \"I already set a record.\" Indeed, there have been approximately 5,000 players to suit up in the NBA, and James is the only one to stick around for 23 seasons. He has also scored more regular-season points than anyone else in league history (42,184), scored more postseason points (8,289), made more All-Star games (21) and was a part of the first active father-son duo to share the court as players together when he and Bronny James checked in against the Minnesota Timberwolves on opening night last fall.

Wright Wemby, Luka, Ant? Examining the players primed to become the face of the NBA Zach Kram 2 Related The accomplishments -- including the four MVPs, four championships and four Finals MVPs -- are well-documented. But if L.A. represents the fourth quarter of James' career after the first three were spent in Cleveland, Miami and Cleveland once more, the question now is whether the clock is truly running out -- or if he will push this thing to overtime. As James embarks on his eighth season with the Lakers -- the longest consecutive stint he's had with any of the franchises he's played for -- he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time after he exercised his $52.6 million option for the 2025-26 season in June without negotiating for an extension. During the Lakers' annual media day last week, the first question James fielded was about retirement. \"I don't know,\" said James, who earned second-team All-NBA honors in his 22nd season. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to play the game that I love for another season. And however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested. Because, like you said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later.\" The Lakers, who will be without James for the next three to four weeks as he deals with sciatica in his right side, are coming off a season in which they traded for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic and secured the No. 3 seed in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. But they fell to the No. 6-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. After James opted into his contract to stay in L.A., his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, issued a statement to ESPN's Shams Charania that many interpreted as an indication that James could finish his career somewhere else. \"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. ... We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.\" And after having full control over his career for his first 22 years, what's best and what's realistic could prove to be at odds. Here are the four possible ways this unprecedented season could go for James and the Lakers. LeBron James is excited about his Lakers squad this season and isn't sweating being in a contract year. James' time with the Lakers has seen him battle a rash of injuries that caused him to miss 124 games in seven seasons after he had missed only 71 in his first 15 years in the league. The Lakers' brass has cycled through four head coaches and the front office has had a mixed record on its trades and signings. Still, there has been plenty of success. The Lakers won a championship in 2020, with James becoming the first player in history to take home Finals MVP for three different teams. The franchise celebrated James in grand fashion when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer in 2023. And in 2024, the Lakers used the No. 55 pick to draft Bronny, allowing James to achieve what he had stated as his last remaining priority when he told ESPN, \"I need to be on the floor with my boy.\" A few months before the 2024 draft, the Golden State Warriors inquired about trading for James. The Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested. After the trade talks had passed, James expressed his commitment to the franchise. \"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and [have] been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said. Lakers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka, speaking at his annual season-opening news conference a few days before media day, made it clear where the franchise stands. \"We would love if LeBron's story would be, he retired a Laker,\" Pelinka said. \"That would be a positive story.\" While several sources close to James have told ESPN that it is unknown how the end of his career will play out, it could help James' desire to play on the best Lakers' team possible this season if it appears he has more basketball in him.

The Lakers can trade either their 2031 or 2032 first-round pick this season and have the right to swap firsts in five seasons in any deals they pursue this season, but they could be reticent to use those assets to invest in a team built for Doncic and James, if James is on the way out. For those looking for clues, there are a few out there. The Nike \"Forever King\" ad features a narrator speaking about James' career in the past tense -- \"They called him the Chosen One ... We were all witnesses.\" The Cleveland Cavaliers' \"Classic Edition\" uniform for this season is the same style James wore when he came into the league as a rookie with the Cavs in 2003-04. The NBA schedule makers had L.A.'s first home game of the season and last road game of the season both be against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, a fitting way for the two most important players of their era to have a proper send-off, if James is indeed on his last lap. And after media day, on his Instagram account, James posted a compilation of moments from the day with Lenny Kravitz's \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" playing underneath, possibly hinting at the end. Pelinka's answer at the news conference about James retiring with the Lakers was telling because he answered a different question than he was asked. He was asked if the Lakers would be interested in re-signing James in the summer of 2026. L.A. is projected to have approximately $50 million in cap space, which would all be swallowed up by James if he was to seek a new max contract. James will be eligible to sign up to a three-year deal for $188 million, with a starting salary of $58.1 million for 2026-27, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks. As great as James has been, extending his prime well beyond any reasonable actuarial table, there is a natural question as to how his timeline syncs up with the team's two other best players, both of whom are in their mid 20s. Doncic and Reaves, for their part, love playing with James and want the partnership to continue, sources told ESPN. Both players have not inquired with James about when he plans to retire, sources said, wanting to show respect for James' process. Doncic, who idolized James growing up, has enjoyed their partnership and believes James is vital to L.A.'s ability to win now, sources said. He is also undaunted by any spectacle or circus that could come with pairing up with James as he closes out his career because Doncic already experienced an aging legend on his farewell tour when Dirk Nowitzki's last season with the Dallas Mavericks coincided with Doncic's rookie year. Doncic found the time with Nowitzki to be invaluable, sources said. Plus, if the Lakers happen to win the championship this season -- bringing James' career total to five -- would he see that as a perfect ending, or would he want to come back to try to defend it and tie Michael Jordan with six? Tim Bontemps remains unsure on whether LeBron James will continue to play for the Lakers beyond next season. Paul's statement to ESPN in June established James' final priority as the curtain falls on his career: to win. That means, if L.A. is struggling -- whether because of injuries, poor roster fits, or simply because the team isn't good enough to thrive in the crowded West -- James could opt to leave. Since James holds a no-trade clause in his contract, any deal would need a greenlight from James to be executed. The problem is, there are not many viable destinations for him. Play Fantasy Basketball this season • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Cleveland, which would represent a second and perhaps final homecoming, would need to send out nearly $90 million in salaries to make a trade work, according to Marks, and the deal would have to involve multiple teams because the Cavs are not allowed to be over the second apron in a James trade. Because of their apron limitations, the Cavs would also be prevented from signing James off the waiver wire if he reached a buyout with L.A. The Warriors and New York Knicks would also be ineligible to sign James in that scenario. Then there's the Mavericks. James has won titles with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving , and has close relationships with coach Jason Kidd and several members of Kidd's staff. But the Mavs, too, would need to send out an exorbitant amount of money to make a deal work, according to Marks. Dallas is also currently a second-apron team, and would need to trade $12 million in salary without taking any back in order to become a buyout destination for James. There are 10 teams projected to have significant cap space in the summer of 2026, including the Brooklyn Nets , LA Clippers and Chicago Bulls , and there could be options for James that are currently unforeseen. However, it would be a major life change to leave Southern California when Savannah (his wife) and Zhuri (his daughter) live there, Bronny is under contract with the Lakers, and Bryce (his son) is a short flight away at the University of Arizona. And James will be in a free agent pool that potentially includes other stars such as Kevin Durant , Trae Young and James Harden -- plus impact players such as Reaves, Draymond Green , Bradley Beal , Norman Powell and Coby White -- so it's not a given he would receive endless interest around the league. And so James' situation remains undecided, and it's yet to be determined whether his 23rd season will be a countdown toward the end of his career or merely the bridge to a 24th, or beyond. Or whether his body will make the decision for him. \"Everyone is trying to dictate when he's done and the reality is nobody actually knows,\" a source close to James told ESPN. James, for his part, says he isn't concerned with the future for now. \"Not worried about yesterday and not trying to focus on what the future holds,\" he told ESPN. \"It's about staying present. ... Because like I said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it is not as long [away as] 'The Godfather 2.' So I know I got to stay present.\""}

Spokespersons representing the teams issued the same statement to ESPN: \"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved. The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks filed the lawsuit in August 2023, seeking more than $10 million in damages . The team alleged that the Raptors poached Ikechukwu Azotam, who worked for New York from 2020 to 2023, and ordered him to provide a trove of internal information after Toronto began recruiting him in the summer of 2023. The Knicks argued that this effort was geared toward giving the Raptors a competitive advantage. The Knicks specifically alleged that Azotam -- who worked for the Knicks as an assistant video coordinator, then as a director of video/analytics/player development assistant -- sent the Raptors thousands of confidential files, including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The Knicks also alleged that Azotam did so at the request of the Raptors, whom they said were trying to \"organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff,\" the August 2023 complaint stated. The Raptors, Azotam, Toronto head coach Darko Rajaković, player development coach Noah Lewis and 10 \"unknown\" employees were listed as defendants in the lawsuit. In an October 2023 court filing, the Raptors called the Knicks' allegations \"baseless\" and a \"public relations stunt.\" The Raptors also argued that the \"alleged 'theft of data' involved little more than publicly available information compiled through public sources readily accessible to all NBA Members.\" The Raptors repeatedly called for NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in and settle the dispute, and a judge in the U.S. Southern District Court in Lower Manhattan agreed . The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, meaning it is dismissed permanently."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might've made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4 of 5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. Harper played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot, or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he'd feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense, too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So, I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter after running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically, but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So, [it's] just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates from a cluster of nerve roots in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, the Lakers are 56-78 (.418)."}

Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

McConnell sustained his injury during Tuesday night's preseason game against the Minnesota Timberwolves . The Pacers made a move to address their depth at point guard Thursday, signing veteran Cameron Payne to a training camp contract. The Pacers waived guard Delon Wright in a corresponding move. Wright also left the Pacers' preseason opener early due to a head injury. McConnell, 33, averaged 9.1 points and 4.4 assists last season in 79 games. He averaged 9.5 points and 4 assists in 23 playoff games to help the Pacers reach the NBA Finals. The Pacers were already short-handed at point guard with All-Star Tyrese Haliburton sidelined for the season because of a torn Achilles he suffered in the Pacers' Game 7 Finals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Andrew Nembhard will start at point guard this season in Haliburton's absence. The Pacers open the regular season on Oct. 23 against the Thunder in a rematch of the Finals."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds.

Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League. He is set to back up DeMar DeRozan , so presumably he wouldn't get enough minutes early on, but he's another free agent I'll have my eye on once the season begins.

The New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors agreed to voluntarily dismiss a lawsuit alleging the Raptors stole thousands of confidential files from the Knicks, according to a court filing obtained by ESPN . The teams dismissed the suit with prejudice, permanently ending the legal dispute. The case was initially set to be settled this summer , nearly two years after the Knicks filed the suit in August 2023 . \"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved,\" team spokespersons said to ESPN. \"The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks alleged in the 2023 lawsuit that the Raptors recruited Ikechukwu Azotam -- who worked as the Knicks' assistant video coordinator -- and ordered him to send them confidential material including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The team sought $10 million in damages . The Knicks alleged that the Raptors, who had recently hired coach Darko Rajaković, \"conspired to use Azotam's position as a current Knicks insider to funnel proprietary information to the Raptors to help them organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff.\" The Raptors in October 2023 filed a motion to dismiss, argued that the claims were \"baseless\" and said the information was publicly available to all NBA members. They asked NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in, and a U.S. District Court judge ruled last year , to the Knicks' chagrin, that Silver should resolve the dispute. He was set to oversee the settlement in an arbitration meeting in July. It is a rare occurrence for NBA teams to sue one another. The only other known case came in 1977 when the Knicks were involved in a dispute with the Nets . They claimed that the Nets' attempted move from Long Island to New Jersey infringed on their territorial rights, and the Nets sued and claimed the Knicks were violating antitrust laws. The NBA and state of New Jersey settled the dispute, and the Nets paid the Knicks $4 million for the right to move. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Strahinja Jokić, the older brother of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokić, pleaded guilty Friday to charges stemming from a fight that occurred during an NBA playoff game in April 2024. He pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing and one count of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to one year of probation. The incident drew widespread attention after a short video of the altercation circulated on social media following the Nuggets' Game 2 win against the Los Angeles Lakers last postseason. The clip, which was later cited in a police statement of probable cause, appeared to show a verbal exchange between the Jokić brothers and a fan before one of the brothers struck the man in the face. One of Nikola Jokic’s older brothers punched a fan after last night’s Nuggets and Lakers game. 😳 (via cgallegos67/TT) pic.twitter.com/JdpNLxxjg0 Investigators identified Strahinja Jokić as the person who threw the punch. According to police documents , he told officers he \"felt he'd done nothing wrong because he was 'defending an older man that he has known for a long time.'\" The older Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault but ultimately pleaded guilty to lesser offenses as part of a resolution to the case. The incident did not involve his younger brother, Nikola, who was on the court at the time of the playoff game. Jokić's older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, are regular fixtures courtside at Nuggets games and have been protective presences throughout Nikola's career. It's not the first time Strahinja has faced legal trouble in Denver. In 2019, he was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman during an altercation inside an apartment. He was charged with second-degree assault , false imprisonment and obstruction of phone service, later pleading guilty in 2020 to felony trespassing and a misdemeanor count of obstruction. The remaining charges were dismissed. The Jokić brothers have also been involved in several public incidents tied to Nikola's on-court altercations. In 2021, they traded social media messages with NBA players Marcus Morris and Markieff Morris after a scuffle between Nikola and Markieff during a game against the Miami Heat . That same year, video surfaced of Strahinja and Nemanja shouting at Phoenix Suns players from the stands following a hard foul involving Nikola during the playoffs. While Nikola Jokić has largely stayed clear of controversy, his brothers' passionate support has at times drawn attention away from the three-time MVP's dominance on the court. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Officers were responding to an unrelated multi-vehicle crash that temporarily closed several lanes of the northbound freeway. As traffic lanes reopened, officers noticed a Range Rover stopped in the road south of the crash site. When approached, Pierce was asleep in the driver's seat, and officers observed signs of alcohol impairment, according to a CHP news release. Pierce was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor driving under the influence and booked at the CHP's Central Los Angeles Area office.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . It's one thing to lose in the NLDS after entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. It's quite another to be eliminated in the most heartbreaking fashion imaginable , which is what happened to the Phillies in Game 4. After Philadelphia fought into the 11th inning of a pitcher's duel, the Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the frame. Andy Pages hit a little nubber back to the mound, and instead of trying for the out a first base, Orion Kerkering threw the ball away at home plate. Asked for his thoughts on the play after the game, Kerkering faced the harsh reality : \"This really f---ing sucks right now.\" Once the sting of this one starts to wear off, the Phillies will have to look ahead to an offseason full of unknowns . In particular, free agency could bring big changes to the Philly clubhouse. As R.J. Anderson writes, a few key players are set to hit the market, and the Phillies must decide whether they're willing to pony up in order to retain them. Misery loves company, and the Phillies weren't alone in the City of Brotherly Love . The Eagles lost to the Giants , and the Flyers dropped their season-opener. That's just the second time all three teams have lost on the same day. At least the 76ers didn't lose. Allow me to play the role of Captain Obvious and point out the LeBron James ' injury is a big blow for the Lakers as they begin the 2025-26 season. For more insightful reaction and analysis, we turn to CBS Sports NBA expert Sam Quinn. Could this James injury open the door to more playing time for Bronny James ? Who will start in place of the four-time MVP? These are some of the questions Quinn wrestles with in his piece on the ripple effects of James' absence , but the most intriguing question is whether this boosts Luka Dončić 's bid for the MVP. Even before this injury to James, there was some question about whether the Lakers added enough around Dončić to be true NBA title contenders. That question is only more pertinent now. Just as everyone predicted, the Giants faced the Eagles as 7.5-point underdogs and came away with a 34-17 win . As has been the case for the last few weeks, Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo led the way for New York on the field and in the vibes department. Right from the jump, Dart and Skattebo were locked in as they tormented Vic Fangio 's defense. Dart finished the night with 253 total yards and two touchdowns. Skattebo piled up 110 total yards and three scores. Those numbers are great, but they don't even tell the full story. In last week's loss to the Saints , Dart committed three turnovers, and the Giants committed five as a team. Those tanked their chance to win on the road (duh), but New York committed zero turnovers on Thursday. Dart's ability to avoid those negative and disastrous plays only enhance what's in the box score. The duo of Dart and Skattebo has a bright future, but they're already doing big things in the present. Jordan Dajani explains the multiple ways in which that big blue tandem made some history last night.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year odds, picks: Best bets, from favorites to long shots", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-sixth-man-of-the-year-odds-picks-best-bets-from-favorites-to-long-shots/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T14:55:07+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "The Sixth Man of the Year race will be wide open in the 2025-26 season", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

See which current stars and emerging names will lead the next generation of fantasy hoops.", "body": "Figuring out where to rank players is difficult enough in any particular season. But how about doing it with an eye towards what the NBA may look like in five years? That’s the point of this exercise, with Rotoworld basketball writers Raphielle Johnson and Noah Rubin combining to put together their top-25 fantasy list for 2030. While the list is primarily populated with players currently in the NBA, there are a few who have yet to play an official NBA game. Some players, whether in the NBA now or yet to reach that point, will break through by 2030. Here’s our top 25, and it should not be surprising who leads the way. Age (as of October 10): 21 After taking the NBA by storm as a rookie, Wembanyama’s impact was muted last season due to a blood clot that sidelined him from the All-Star break onward. The 7-foot-3 phenom has been given a clean bill of health and is poised to usher in a new era in the NBA. Before his season-ending injury in February, Wembanyama averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.1 steals, 3.8 blocks and 3.1 three-pointers per game with 47.6/35.2/83.6 shooting splits. Age: 18 Flagg has yet to play in an official NBA game, but the incoming rookie is deserving of being high on any list that’s looking ahead to five years from now. He won’t turn 19 until just before Christmas, making it possible (likely, even) that the Mavericks forward still will not have reached his prime by 2030. He’s got all the skills a franchise could want in a cornerstone, which is a void the Mavericks need to fill after trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers. Cooper Flagg was EVERYWHERE during his preseason debut 🔥🔥🔥 10p/6r/3a/1b in 14 minutes pic.twitter.com/p8CGp8A6mF Age: 27 Gilgeous-Alexander, who won NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Finals MVP honors while leading the Thunder to their first title last season, is still not 30 years old. Yet it feels like he’s been around for far longer than that, with the Canadian point guard being the 11th overall pick in the 2018 draft. Who knows how many titles and individual accolades he’ll have on his résumé by the time 2030 rolls around, but SGA should remain one of the best assets in fantasy basketball. Age: 24 Cunningham’s production has increased in each of his four NBA seasons, with the 2024-25 campaign being the one in which his growth coincided with that of the franchise he leads. Appearing a career-best 70 games, Cunningham averaged 26.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 9.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.1 three-pointers. The Pistons point guard recorded career-high averages in points, assists, blocks and three-pointers with a 46.9/35.6/84.6 shooting split. If Cunningham can keep the turnovers in check, as he averaged 4.4 per game last season, he’ll be an even better player to have rostered in fantasy leagues. Age: 26 Like many who follow basketball, Dončić was stunned when the Mavericks traded him to the Lakers in late January. He appeared in a career-low 50 games in 2024-25, appearing in 60 or more in each of his first six seasons. While LeBron James remains active currently, the Lakers have already made it clear that the franchise has begun the “Dončić Era,” and this summer, he signed an extension that runs through the 2028-29 campaign. As long as Luka is healthy, he’ll be one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 Mobley’s fourth NBA season was his best, with the Cavaliers forward/center averaging 18.5 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 0.9 steals, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 three-pointers per game. His role on the offensive end of the floor expanded in the first season of Kenny Atkinson’s tenure as head coach, and there’s still plenty of room for growth. The only question is what will Cleveland’s frontcourt look like in 2030. Will Mobley continue to share the court with another big man, as he currently does with Jarrett Allen ? Or will he shift to center full-time? Age: 24 Like Mobley, Edwards’ position could change by the time the year 2030 rolls around. Current Timberwolves starting point guard Mike Conley turns 38 on October 11, meaning there could come a point in the near future where Edwards is either sharing the backcourt with Rob Dillingham or being utilized as an uber-athletic scoring point guard. Whatever is decided, Ant-Man has the skill needed to be a cornerstone for his franchise and fantasy rosters. Age: 23 Şengün, who led Türkiye to a silver medal at EuroBasket this past summer, turned 23 in late July. While his scoring average decreased by two points compared to his 2023-24 number, the Rockets center earned his first All-Star Game appearance last season and averaged a double-double for the first time in four NBA seasons. Şengün’s all-around skill set makes him a center who should be highly valuable in fantasy leagues five years from now, especially if he were to develop a more reliable perimeter shot. Age: 22 After taking on a supplementary role as a rookie, the versatile Thompson figured more prominently in the Rockets’ rotation last season. And with Fred VanVleet sidelined by a torn ACL, the 2025-26 season could be a preview of what’s to come for Thompson. Compared to his rookie season, the 6-foot-7 wing’s averages improved in all major categories while shooting nearly 56 percent from the field. Like Şengün, Thompson is in a position where things could get truly scary if he’s able to develop a consistent perimeter shot over the next five years. Age: 23 The biggest concern for Holmgren is the injuries. After sitting out the entire 2022-23 season with a foot injury, he was limited to 32 games last season by a broken hip. Sandwiched in between those two seasons was a 2023-24 campaign in which Holmgren did not miss a game. When on the floor, he’s a gifted frontcourt player who can be used at power forward or center, and that versatility will serve Holmgren well over the next five years. Age: 23 Like Holmgren, availability has been an issue for Johnson during the early stages of his NBA career. He’s appeared in more than 60 games just once and is coming off a 2024-25 campaign in which he was limited to 36 appearances. However, Johnson did finish last season with career-high averages in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots while shooting 50 percent from the field. As long as he stays relatively healthy, the tools are there for Johnson to be a highly impactful fantasy player in 2030. Age: 18 Peterson is the first of three players on this list who have yet to play a college game, much less enter the NBA. But the Kansas freshman is that good. A combo guard who can play on or off the ball, the 6-foot-5 Peterson is on the short list of many regarding the top draft-eligible prospects for 2026. Winner of the 2025 Naismith Trophy Boys School Player of the Year award, Peterson was also a McDonald’s All-American this past season. High praise from Coach B 🙌 Our 2011-12 @Werner_Safety Naismith Men’s College COY shares how impressed he is with incoming Freshman Darryn Peterson. 👀 pic.twitter.com/YZrxWsxzZM Age: 24 Maxey, who will turn 25 in early November, has averaged 25.9 and 26.3 points per game over the last two seasons. While there are significant questions regarding teammate Joel Embiid’s injury history, the 2024-25 campaign was the first in which Maxey failed to play at least 60 games. In five years’ time, he should be the cornerstone in Philadelphia and an elite player worthy of first-round consideration, regardless of league format. Age: 18 The 6-foot-9 Boozer, whose father Carlos enjoyed a 13-year NBA career, was a two-time winner of the Gatorade National Player of the Year award while in high school. The combination of build, athleticism and skill set makes the younger Boozer a player capable of playing anywhere in the frontcourt, and that versatility tends to make for an excellent fantasy option. Like Peterson and another player a little further down on this list, Boozer is projected to be among the top draft-eligible talents for 2026. Age: 25 While it remains to be seen how Haliburton’s recovery from a ruptured Achilles tendon will go, he’s already one of the best players in fantasy basketball when healthy. Last season, he averaged 18.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.7 blocks and 3.0 three-pointers per game while leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000. He’ll miss the entire 2025-26 campaign, but Haliburton should remain one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 After three seasons in which he played at least 70 games, Wagner suffered an oblique injury that limited him to 60 appearances last season. However, he was excellent when on the floor, providing fourth-round value in eight- and nine-cat formats. A healthy Wagner can be an even greater asset, regardless of league format, because of his efficiency and versatile game. Like a few of the players above him on this list, Wagner needs to improve his perimeter shot, as he’s shot 28.1 and 29.5 percent from three over the past two seasons. Age: 24 The reigning champion Thunder have three players on this list, and none are over 27 years old. Williams can be plugged in just about anywhere within a lineup; that’s how versatile his game is. Due to injuries, he even spent some time at the center position last season. Williams’ averages have increased in each of his three NBA seasons, and he earned third-team All-NBA and second-team All-Defense honors in 2024-25. He won’t be 30 years old until the latter stages of the 2030-31 regular season and still has not begun his athletic prime. Age: 27 Like Haliburton, Tatum is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during last season’s playoffs. However, the Celtics star’s recovery will be interesting to watch, as he has not been officially ruled out for the 2025-26 season. Will Tatum attempt to return? And how would that impact the next five years of his NBA career? Tatum already has eight NBA seasons under his belt, but he has the skill set that can make him a serious factor in fantasy basketball when 2030 rolls around. Age: 18 The third and final current collegian on this list, Dybantsa will also be in contention to go first overall in next summer’s draft if he declares. The 6-foot-10 forward will be the biggest story in the state of Utah this season, especially with the Jazz in the midst of a rebuild. Dybantsa was the top-ranked prospect in the Class of 2025 and is a three-time FIBA gold medalist. Dybantsa’s explosive athleticism and varied skill set make him a player who can have a significant impact in fantasy basketball by the time 2030 rolls around. AJ Dybantsa made his BYU debut tonight at Marriott Madness 🔥 @MarchMadnessMBB pic.twitter.com/yGdZqWHRBz Age: 19 The second overall pick in the 2025 draft, the 6-foot-6 Harper can be used anywhere on the perimeter. During his lone season at Rutgers, he spent most of his time on the ball but can also take on an off-ball role. On a Spurs roster that includes Wembanyama, De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle , that may be something Harper has to do early on, but he’s capable of progressing into a lead playmaker role over the next five seasons. Age: 22 The 6-foot-10 Banchero has recorded increased points and rebounds averages in each of his three NBA seasons, but turnovers have limited his impact in fantasy basketball, especially in category leagues. However, that should not be the case in 2030, when Banchero may be beginning his athletic prime. Five years from now, this spot on the list may prove to be egregiously low for Banchero. Age: 24 Despite his age, Ball has already played five NBA seasons. However, while production has not been an issue for the Hornets’ point guard, staying on the court has. The 2021-22 season is the only one in which Ball has played at least 60 games; he’s appeared in 47 or fewer in each of the last three. The injury concerns have knocked Ball down many fantasy draft boards; hopefully, that won’t be an issue five years from now. Age: 30 Jokić is the only player on this list aged 30 years or older. However, the skill set and elite production cannot be ignored, especially for a player whose game is not reliant on “jump out of the gym” athleticism. The Joker has been the top-ranked player in fantasy basketball in per-game value in four of the last five seasons, and no lower than second in totals in six straight. Will Jokić still be in the NBA in five years’ time? We’ll see, but the track record of excellence is why he has to be on this list. Age: 24 After earning his first All-Star Game appearance in 2023-24, Barnes recorded similar numbers last season. And he’s capable of doing more, provided he becomes a more consistent shooter. Barnes shot 27.1 percent from three last season and is a career 30 percent shooter from deep on 3.6 attempts per game. He doesn’t have to turn into the next Stephen Curry , but consistent shooting would improve Barnes’ fantasy profile, given what he can already do as a playmaker and defender. Age: 27 Young has played 73 games or more in three of the last four seasons, and most recently, he led the NBA in assists. Having averaged a points/assists double-double each of the last three seasons, the Hawks’ point guard can remain a fantasy force for years to come. Something to watch is how young players like Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels progress, as their development may benefit Young in the turnover category. He’s averaged at least four per game each of the last six seasons, lowering Young’s value in nine-cat formats. A Division of NBCUniversal .

We'll see if a deal gets done before the season or during the upcoming year.\" Westbrook's decorated resume speals for itself, with an NBA MVP and two scoring titles to his name. While the 37-year-old guard is a ways removed from his prime, Westbrook appears to still have plenty left in the tank after serving as a vital cog in the Denver Nuggets' rotation during the 2024-25 NBA season. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game in 75 appearances for Denver in his last campaign, shooting 44.9 percent from the floor and 32.3 percent from deep. The Kings signed Schröder to a three-year contract that likely slots him into Sacramento's starting point guard role, but the addition of Westbrook could prove to be a vital step in insulating the team's backcourt for the marathon that is the NBA season. Sacramento opens the regular season on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 22. Whether or not Westbrook will be in a Kings jersey by then remains to be seen, but it certainly is something to keep an eye on going forward. Download and follow The Deuce & Mo Podcast"}

They also stayed winless in the preseason, falling to a 128-98 loss to the Magic in their first exhibition game at Xfinity Mobile Arena. VJ Edgecombe sat because of left hip soreness. He took part in the Sixers’ morning shootaround and is considered day-to-day, according to a team official. Other absences included Joel Embiid (left knee), Paul George (left knee), Trendon Watford (right hamstring) and Jared McCain (right thumb). Quentin Grimes was inactive two days after his first practice of the season. The Sixers will hold their annual Blue-White scrimmage Sunday and finish their four-game preseason next Friday vs. the Timberwolves. Here are observations on the team's loss to Orlando: Tyrese Maxey and Dominick Barlow were early standouts. The Sixers’ first basket came on a Maxey transition three-pointer. To no one’s surprise, Maxey came out aggressively. He fired up nine shots in under seven minutes and played with tons of speed and confidence. Maxey poured in 17 first-quarter points and watched the rest of the game. three ball courtesy of @TyreseMaxey 👌 pic.twitter.com/2f5ggfpiuc Barlow scored the Sixers’ next bucket on a put-back layup. He did strong work on the offensive boards in his third straight start and had 12 points and nine rebounds over 29 minutes. Barlow has a 7-foot-3 wingspan and good athletic tools, and he’s rebounded the way those on-paper traits would suggest. Notably, the Sixers plan to be a guard-heavy team and know they must improve their rebounding. Barlow’s boosted his case for minutes with his preseason showing on the glass. Well done for a 22-year-old on a two-way contract. Not for the first time, Adem Bona had a rough start on the foul front. He committed two personals in under two minutes, including on a Wendell Carter Jr. and-one jumper. Of course, the other side of Bona’s ball-hungry defensive style is that he’s often rewarded with rejections. His bounce and rim-protecting instincts popped as usual. Bona swatted Desmond Bane, Paolo Banchero and Anthony Black layup attempts in the first half. Bona with the denial! 🚫 pic.twitter.com/XYS4Kd1LQN Andre Drummond continued to play behind Bona. The highlights of Drummond's night were a pair of corner three-pointers. Drummond made three long-range jumpers and missed 17 last season. He’s 18 for 140 (12.9 percent) in his career. Hunter Sallis received first-quarter minutes and got an and-one runner to drop against fellow rookie guard Jace Richardson. The Wake Forest product tallied seven points and three assists in 34 minutes. The Sixers used a five-man bench in the first half of Sallis, Drummond, Kennedy Chandler, Jabari Walker and Johni Broome. Emoni Bates and Malcolm Hill checked in after halftime. Broome (six points, three steals) played at both power forward and center. He had some tough moments defensively against players like Banchero and Carter. Banchero tried to drive baseline past Broome and throw down a powerful slam. Broome stopped him with a clear-cut foul. The 23-year-old lefty's physicality and shot blocking were strengths in college. It’s an open question how he’ll adapt to NBA-level size, quickness and leaping. Chandler was the Sixers' lead ball handler for much of the game and had a 16-point, five assist, four-steal night. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse has given him significant minutes in all three of the team's preseason contests. “ He’s played very well,” Nurse said following the Sixers' practice Thursday. “ He’s got pretty good feel for running and organizing the team. He’s also got some juice to get by people and get to the basket. And he’s also a very good shooter. “ He didn’t shoot as much from three in those games as he’s been doing in practice. He’s a legit threat from three. ... I’ve been impressed with his knowledge of the game, the way he’s picked things up and the way he’s transferred that to keeping the team fairly organized.”"}

Even for Antetokounmpo.", "body": "Talks in August between the Knicks and Bucks about a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade never gained real traction. That shouldn’t be a real surprise. If the Bucks are forced to trade one of the five best players walking the face of the earth — and they would only do so if Antetokounmpo demands it — they will want back a massive haul of first-round draft picks and promising young players, two things the Knicks do not have. One other thing that shouldn’t be a surprise out of those talks: Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson was “untouchable in these talks,” something Sam Amick reported at The Athletic . Not only is Brunson an All-NBA player on a favorable contract, but he is also a fan favorite and hero in New York. Trading him would anger the fan base, even if it was for Antetokounmpo. One of the financially cleanest trade options between the Knicks and Bucks is Brunson and Josh Hart for Antetokounmpo, those salaries come within about $300,000 of each other and work under the salary cap restrictions. It’s also a non-starter for both sides — the Knicks aren’t giving up Brunson, while the Bucks want picks and young players to jump-start a rebuild, not veterans. Any eventual Knicks offer likely involves Karl-Anthony Towns and a player such as OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges (who can’t be traded until Feb. 1 and has a massive new contract kicking in). A mid-season trade of Antetokounmpo and his $54.1 million salary — to the Knicks or any team — is highly unlikely. Things get interesting if Antetokounmpo says he does not intend to sign the four-year, $260 million extension the Bucks can offer next offseason. If that happens, there would be a massive line of teams that would want in on an Antetokounmpo deal and many of them — Houston, San Antonio, Chicago and others — have the young players and picks Milwaukee would be seeking in a deal. Likely the only way Antetokounmpo ends up in New York is if he forces his way there, telling teams he will only sign an extension with the Knicks, and if these other teams trade for him, he will be a rental. Even then, like Toronto did with Kawhi Leonard in 2018, those teams still may be willing to take the gamble. For now, everyone wants to see how this season plays out. The Knicks rightfully see themselves as a team that can come out of the East. The Bucks want to see what Antetokounmpo and Myles Turner look like together. Houston with Kevin Durant, San Antonio with its young backcourt, and just about every other team wants to see how things look before making a massive move like trading for Antetokounmpo. Which is why it’s likely there is no action until next offseason. That’s not going to stop the chatter and rumors. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Strahinja Jokić, 43, pleaded guilty to trespassing and disorderly conduct after punching a Lakers fan in the face courtside at the Nuggets' Ball Arena. The trespassing charge is a misdemeanor, whereas the disorderly conduct charge is a petty offense. Strahinja Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault after video of the punch made the rounds on social media. The Lakers fan, identified as Nicholas Meyer, claimed in a lawsuit that he suffered a concussion as well as cuts and bruises on his face, plus a deviated septum, per The Denver Post. \"The assault shattered my sense of safety and control,\" Meyer said in court Friday, via 9News . \"I became fearful of leaving my home, especially with my family. I worry constantly about retaliation, not just from the Jokić family, but from fans who might recognize me and act out violently.\" Strahinja Jokić was charged in July 2024.

In 2019, Strahinja Jokić was charged with assault and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing phone service and a felony count of trespassing as part of a deferred sentence, per The Denver Post, which reported that he was accused of choking and pushing a woman and then precluding her from calling 911. Strahinja Jokić's trespassing charge was dismissed in 2022 after he successfully followed court rules for unsupervised probation and didn't commit another crime during the two-year term, according to The Denver Post, which cited court records.

Recovery from sciatica tends to take more than a couple of weeks.", "body": "While the Lakers just announced this week that LeBron James is suffering from sciatica and will be out for the first couple of weeks of the season — at least — it turns out he has been dealing with this for months. LeBron first started experiencing sciatica nerve pain in late July or early August during on-court workouts, reports Shams Charania of ESPN on NBA Today . Here is what he said: “My understanding is this injury for LeBron, this nerve issue, first developed, first occurred, in late July, early August, during an on-court workout. So it’s now two-and-a-half months and counting that he’s had to deal with it and manage it. So even before the Lakers’ Media Day on Sept. 29 and the start of training camp, I’m told LeBron James had not done much basketball for well over a month prior to that. So it had been a normal routine summer for him. He’s a creature of habit, we know that by the way he maintains his body. So for him to be out to start the season and miss his first-ever Opening Night, it shows an admission by him and the Lakers that he needs more time to ramp up, getting into basketball shape, getting into the right basketball conditioning that he’s accustomed to. He’s not there yet.” Because of the pain on his right side — the sciatic nerve runs from the tailbone down the leg to the feet — LeBron has been limited in his workouts, both physically and on the court. Once he’s pain free, it’s going to take time for him to get his conditioning up to speed and shake some of the rust off his game. All that can take longer at age 40. LeBron will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, but could well be out longer. For the Lakers, that puts more on Luka Doncic’s plate to start the season. It will also start to give GM Rob Pelinka and the Lakers front office a view of what Austin Reaves looks like as the No. 2 option next to Doncic. Reaves can be (and is expected to be) a free agent next summer, and the Lakers have to decide if he’s worth it to them to pay him $25-30 million a season and keep him around, or if they should look elsewhere. How this injury heals — and what’s causing the compression of the sciatic nerve, whether it’s muscular, a herniated disc, or something else — could also impact LeBron’s decision about how much longer he wants to play. LeBron is entering a record 23rd NBA season and will be a free agent next summer, giving him a lot of options for what the final year or years of his playing career could look like.

Steph Curry has been a Warrior for life. Drafted by Golden State in 2009, he has become the face of the franchise, a multi-time MVP and champion. He has worn No. 30 for all 16 seasons of his Warriors career, a number that’s become part of his identity as much as his shooting form. So when his younger brother joined Golden State , one question lingered: what number would Seth Curry take? He wasn’t able to secure No. 30 from Steph. “I tried to buy it from him,” Seth joked. “He said he didn’t need the money.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. \"I tried to buy it from him, he said he didn't need the money.\" Seth wasn't able to secure No. 30 from Steph 😂 pic.twitter.com/oGeSAVgVkr Seth actually has worn No. 30 for most of his own career, including recent stints with the Brooklyn Nets, Dallas Mavericks and Charlotte Hornets. Before that, he spent two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers wearing No. 31, and earlier in his career bounced between 30, 31 and 10 as he moved from team to team. This NBA season is the first time since Seth entered the league as an undrafted rookie in 2013 that the two have shared a training camp, finally taking the floor as teammates instead of competitors. The 35-year-old joined the Warriors on an Exhibit 9 contract, which allows him to participate in training camp and the preseason. Because of the NBA’s second-apron restrictions, Golden State will need to waive him before finalizing its roster — but the team can re-sign him as early as Nov. 11 while staying under the tax threshold. The lighthearted jersey swap at open practice gave Warriors fans a glimpse of the brothers’ easy chemistry — and a reminder of how rare it is to see both Currys on the same court. Steph remains the Warriors’ cornerstone, while Seth begins a new chapter in familiar territory, wearing a familiar number — just not No. 30. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James , who is suffering from a case of sciatica. The current timetable is set for James to be reevaluated in 3-4 weeks. Needless to say, this is a huge loss for the Lakers, who run the risk of being without the future Hall of Famer for almost a month, which could significantly impact where the organization ends up this season. It's no surprise that James offers production in multiple areas. He's a top-tier playmaker and strong rebounder, and despite being 40 he can still be penciled in for 24-25 points per game. But the stats only tell you so much. There's also the element of him being a 6-foo-9, highly versatile and extremely physical floor presence, which are now features the Lakers will have to play without. James' ability to get to the foul line, as well as the threat of him in transition, will force the Lakers to slow things down, and likely by a considerable margin. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] That's a lot of easy scoring opportunities suddenly taken off the floor, not to mention a big, wide body, who is agile enough to defensively rotate between the perimeter and the interior. This isn't to say the Lakers are out of the playoff picture before the season even starts. But it does make any race later in the year difficult if they find themselves behind the curve when the calendar flips to 2026. With James out, the burden falls even more on the franchise's best player, Luka Dončić. The Slovenian lost weight over the course of summer, and has been getting early MVP buzz based on his play at EuroBasket, where he looked more engaged defensively and had better stamina. Dončić is known as someone who can put up big numbers, and as a player the offense can run through. This hasn't changed, and the Lakers are likely banking on the All-Star to carry an increased level of responsibility with James out. If the Lakers somehow get out to a strong start and find themselves within the top 6 in the time they're without James, that is going to be an enormous argument for the MVP chances of Dončić, who has yet to win one in his career. Of course, he'll have to get some help for the Lakers to find themselves in that position. That's where Austin Reaves, who will unquestionably get more on-ball opportunities without James, has a chance to shine. The 6-5 off-guard has always been reliable, but the Lakers are going to need him to approach legitimate All-Star production with James out. Can he do that, even though his play tends to overlap with that of Dončić? Or will head coach JJ Redick stagger them to a point where both Dončić and Reaves deliver when the other is on the bench? There's a lot to figure out in La La Land, but the Lakers have on-court options to help their chances with James out, and keep their head above water. Of course, it does need reminding that when James does return, it shouldn't come as a surprise if the Lakers dip a little in production. Installing a high-volume scorer, who is also a heavy on-ball creator, doesn't happen overnight, which is something the players and coaching staff will have to ready themselves for."}

[ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Amen Thompson – G/F, Houston Rockets: Amen flashed elite rebounding and defensive instincts last season, averaging roughly 1.15 fantasy points per minute. Playing alongside Kevin Durant should open up lanes for drives and assist opportunities. The lack of 3s and forgettable FT percentage are the only two knocks on an otherwise elite fantasy profile. No Fred VanVleet means Amen and Reed Sheppard will be running the show. Tyrese Maxey – G, Philadelphia 76ers: The undisputed No. 1 option in Philadelphia, Maxey’s efficiency and scoring volume make him a safe bet in all formats. His usage spike ensures multiple 40-plus-point fantasy nights, even with the health concerns surrounding the Sixers' roster. Jalen Green – G, Phoenix Suns: Green’s move to Phoenix gives him the green light to score at will. With Devin Booker drawing defensive gravity, he's always available and has a clean slate to fire away — the exact kind of highly explosive player you'll want for High Score. Kyshawn George - G/F, Washington Wizards: One of the more intriguing deep sleepers, George’s size and floor spacing give him multi-position upside. If he cracks the starting lineup, his length and shooting could push him into must-roster territory. Shaedon Sharpe – G, Portland Trail Blazers: With Anfernee Simons gone, Sharpe steps into a larger offensive role after averaging 27.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 10 games without him last year. Although he averaged under 1.0 FPPM in 2024-25 (0.93), he looks primed to anchor Portland's scoring alongside Deni Avdija. With high usage and expanding playmaking, Sharpe's a breakout bet who will eclipse the 30+ fantasy-point mark per game in High Score and points leagues. Isaiah Collier – G, Utah Jazz: Now Utah's starting point guard, Collier has averaged 6.3 assists and 0.9 steals per game through his first 71 games, solidifying his role as the team's primary facilitator. He's my prime late-round selection for High Score and he could finish top-10 in assists this season. Jaden Ivey – G, Detroit Pistons: Ivey's return from injury has reignited his breakout path. He averaged 17/4/4 last year and he'll be the secondary scoring and facilitating option alongside Cade Cunningham. His blend of pace, scoring and playmaking makes him a High Score steal outside the top 100. With increased usage and a 30-point floor when hot, Ivey's poised to deliver the breakout season Detroit's been waiting for. Paolo Banchero - F, Orlando Magic: The Magic finally have spacing, and that means more playmaking for Banchero. I'm in the minority, but I think we'll see the best version of Paolo yet. With Desmond Bane in town, expect upticks in assists and field-goal efficiency with fewer turnovers. I still prefer him in points over 9-cat leagues, but I'd still get him in 9-cat. Trey Murphy III, F, New Orleans Pelicans: Murphy is one of the league’s best breakout bets for 2025–26. When healthy last season, he averaged 0.98 fantasy points per minute. His combination of athleticism, 3-point volume, and efficiency gives him a real shot at making an All-Star-like leap — both in real life and fantasy. Deni Avdija – F, Portland Trail Blazers: Avdija’s game has always hinted at versatility, and in Portland, he’ll finally be unleashed. After the All-Star break last year, Avdija averaged 23-10-5. Handling the ball more and attacking mismatches, he’s a glue guy with the stat diversity to post strong all-around lines. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Bennedict Mathurin – G/F, Indiana Pacers: Mathurin’s aggressiveness is finally being matched with opportunity. He can get hot quickly, and as long as he locks in on defense, he'll be one of those boom players who's ideal for High Score. He'll also be solid for 9-cat leagues. Zion Williamson – F, New Orleans Pelicans: Zion enters 2025-26 in the best shape of his career, motivated by a contract fitness clause and New Orleans' push to compete before their 2026 pick goes to Atlanta. He averaged 1.56 FPPM in 30 games last year and remains one of the league's most efficient interior scorers, producing elite per-minute output. Since turnovers don't count and ceiling games are the north star in High Score, Zion's a top-15 lock whenever he's active. Brandon Miller – F, Charlotte Hornets: Before his wrist injury, Miller averaged 21.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists while commanding a larger offensive load. His 1.01 FPPM pace shows growth as a shot-creator and secondary playmaker next to LaMelo Ball. He profiles as a multi-category wing with top-60 upside across all formats, especially High Score. Tari Eason – F, Houston Rockets: Eason ranked in the 91st percentile in fantasy points per minute among frontcourt players. His energy translates directly into rebounds, steals and buckets. If his minutes climb, he’s one of the most efficient stat-stuffers available after Round 10. Jalen Duren – C, Detroit Pistons: Duren’s double-double consistency anchors Detroit’s frontcourt. He's in a contract year and has shown growth as a short-roll playmaker. He averaged an impressive 1.23 fantasy points per minute last season, and as his rim protection improves, that number should only climb in his fourth season. Santi Aldama – C, Memphis Grizzlies: Aldama remains under the radar but continues to produce whenever given minutes. His shooting and rebounding profile make him a sneaky floor-spacer who can hit double-digit points and boards in under 25 minutes. Aldama will play heavy minutes to start the year and is still being picked outside of the top 100 on Yahoo. Isaiah Hartenstein – C, Oklahoma City Thunder: Always a per-minute beast (~1.10 fantasy points per minute), Hartenstein is being undervalued in the market across formats. He does everything but shoot 3s and make free throws at a high clip. However, I love him as a sixth- or seventh-round pick if I don't nab bigs earlier in the draft. Kel’el Ware – C, Miami Heat: Nikola Jović's hype is building, but I'm still targeting more shares of Ware. He averaged over 1.0 fantasy points per minute last season and has so much potential as a rim runner. His ADP is falling because he came off the bench in the Heat's past two preseason games; I would buy the dip. Dereck Lively II – C, Dallas Mavericks: Daniel Gafford is already hurt and Lively's ADP is at a very affordable price at 116th overall. With 30 minutes a night potentially on the horizon, Dallas' primary defensive anchor is trending up after a season where he posted 1.19 FPPM. Although his usage is low, he's a cheap double-double big man with boom potential on the defensive end."}

The gym on this day belonged to Jimmy Butler III . “He just had an incredible practice,” coach Steve Kerr said. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “He wasn't on my team, so I didn't like to see it,” Stephen Curry said partly in jest. “But it was indicative of the ceiling that we can get to with a guy like that. A guy who at any moment knows how to win.” Even Butler’s faux nemesis, Buddy Hield , offered nothing but props to the man who turned 36 last month. “Jimmy dominated practice today,” Hield said. “It was great for him. He looked really good and professional today. It was great. Great energy.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Though general praise tends to flow freely in every training camp, the reaction in this instance is highly encouraging for the Warriors. There are many stories of Butler dominating scrimmages in his previous stops, whether Chicago or Minnesota or Philadelphia or Miami. Butler’s infamous scrimmage with the Timberwolves in 2018 is one that made its way around the NBA. Three weeks after asking to be traded, he led a group of reserves to victory over a squad that included four starters, with center Karl-Anthony Towns often the target of his ferocity. Butler was loud, hyperaggressive and, well, a winner. That last trait is welcome in Golden State. Though there was no indication hostility, seeing him bring juice to a scrimmage warms the heart of the team’s established veterans like Curry and Green. For doing so with the Warriors, who belong to Curry more than anyone, suggests Butler still is capable of being The Man. That while he embraces being “Robin” to Curry’s “Batman,” – the roles can be interchangeable upon request. “I just think he took it up a notch today,” Hield said. “He wasn’t chirping like that Jimmy we know of. He was a silent killer, and his work speaks himself.” There were shades of that Jimmy last season, as Butler occasionally took over portions of a game, usually when Curry was off the floor. He managed to make a significant impact despite being the new guy, tossed onto the roster during the searing heat of a playoff chase. “Last year, Jimmy didn’t know any defensive terminology,” Draymond Green said last week. “We were just making it work.” Butler this season is with the Warriors for a full training camp, which followed team workouts he arranged in the days before camp officially began. He’ll miss the third preseason game, Sunday against the Lakers in Los Angeles, for what Kerr called a “wonderful” personal matter, but he is scheduled to practice Saturday in LA before departing. This was, in a way, a reminder. Butler putting together a “Himmy Lives” display can only be beneficial for young Warriors to witness and veterans to realize his back pocket contains plenty of what they hope to see once the regular season begins on Oct. 21. “He was very impactful, across the board, getting to his spots, (flashing) his competitive will,” Curry said. “Our practices have been at pretty high level. Not every day, scrimmaging, but he kind of built up to a good session today. From the jump, Jimmy was attacking the rim, dictating the pace on both ends.” This is the Butler the Warriors need to threaten teams beyond Curry, and every occasion he shows up will be greeted with delight.

As we inch closer to the start of the NBA regular season, we’re getting an early look at players and teams. And while we should take what we see in preseason with a grain of salt, there’s some excitement building. Now would usually be the time to tell you who is on the verge of breaking out in 2025-26, but I find that limiting. When I watch the preseason I'm intrigued by what impact players — from rising stars to established veterans — can have on their teams if something I'm seeing can carry over to the regular season. That’s the joy of the preseason, seeing the payoff from offseason development and preseason experimentation. Here are a few names to keep an eye on at the start of the season. The intrigue with Wembanyama comes from wondering what approach he will take in Year 3. There is a balance that comes with offensive versatility. On one hand, a team can use a player in a lot of different scenarios — on ball, in the post, as a roller, off screens. That type of sandbox approach can keep consistent pressure on defenses, as there is not one specific thing to take away. On the other hand, a team can lose the emphasis on a specific action on a night-to-night basis. One thing has appeared clear from watching Wembanyama in preseason: a change in shot selection. For all of his size and skill, Wembanyama averaged nearly nine 3-point attempts a night last season. Through two preseason games so far, he has taken exactly two 3-pointers. There’s a clear emphasis for Wembanyama to increase his paint touches and work to catch the ball closer to the basket. More attempts to drive the basketball, and more attempts to initiate contact, should result in a better balance offensively. Working to seal matchups near the post or elbow is a way to keep pressure on defenses. His strength will be tested as teams continue to be physical with him on drives or fight to push his catches out. Can he get to his spots consistently? What does that look like when he does? Keep an eye on his playmaking this season. The Spurs have worked to use multiple players as screeners which could open up pops for shooters or rolls when they go double big. Wembanyama appears to be making more contact as a screener while mixing in slips and quick rolls — knowing when to roll and force the weakside to help, and knowing when to pop to force a rotation. A quick swing or a drive against a closeout could keep an advantage for the Spurs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] On the defensive end, Wembanyama is always a sight to behold. In pick-and-roll, he can be near the level of a screen, drop back to contain the drive, use his wingspan to swipe down at the ball-handler and still recover to his man popping or rolling. If the offense takes that space as a chance to pull up, that can easily turn into a switch and contest. His size jumps off the page when he is defending on the weakside, sometimes seeming like he can remove a quadrant off the court with his presence. The rim protection speaks for itself (176 blocks in 46 games last season, most in the league), but I'm intrigued by how he'll adjust as teams work to space him and play off his rotations. Murphy made a large leap last year prior to a shoulder injury, but I believe there is even more room for his game to expand. Never doubt the combination of knowing what you can do and working to improve on everything else. The quick decisions and reads continue to grow. When he’s spaced on the perimeter or running in transition, the threat is no longer just a 3-point shot but a drive. You can feel that impact when he’s used off the ball in dribble handoffs or pindowns. If you are not physical and give him space, or try to go under, the shot is going up. If you lock and trail, he can turn the corner and get to the paint or to his pull-up. If you try to get physical, you open up backdoor cuts or curls to the basket. The Pelicans will need that type of versatility in the half court which pairs well with Zion Williamson’s ability to be used in different ways. Murphy has also been looking to initiate contact to get to where he wants to vs. only taking the space given. An improved handle could open up more opportunities in pick-and-roll where he can reject and try to get downhill. Pitch-and-catch action could open even more room for him. It will be interesting to watch what it looks like if he has the mindset to create space in different areas of the floor. It's not difficult to think of the ways Horford’s experience can help a Warriors team that features Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green. But the speed in which you can see it already has surprised me to a degree. The defense is what jumps off the page. Horford's scheme versatility defending pick-and-roll will add a level of consistency to the Warriors' defense. His ability to get to the level of a screen, turn it into a trap, drop and contain penetration is key. We have seen time and time again no matter the age, Horford is willing to switch and defend multiple positions, and late switches can help the Warriors recover. The Warriors having Horford’s help defense on drives or rotations on the baseline is one thing. Having that with Draymond and Jimmy on the court feels like another. Offensively, Horford’s ability to space and willingness to move the ball fits right into the Warriors' ethos. The passing can open up cutters and keep an advantage for the Warriors when they get a defense in rotation. He can be involved in screening actions on and off the ball. How often have the Warriors had a big who can set a post split and receive a post split? Mike Brown has brought more ball movement, player movement and freedom to the New York Knicks offense. McBride looks like he fits right in to the vision and is set up to thrive within the offense. Simply put, it is wise to believe in a scoring guard within the confines of a Mike Brown offense (see Monk, Malik). More pace and more tempo should open up more opportunities for McBride to attack offensively. More opportunities in transition to attack an early clock suits McBride a little more than bringing the ball up (slowly) and going right into a set. An emphasis on spacing should also highlight McBride’s ability to get downhill to score. The ball moving from side to side should allow McBride to attack a tilted defense. Combine the offensive confidence with the effort he gives defensively and that unlocks even more lineup versatility for the Knicks. Do not be surprised by three-guard looks with McBride guarding a top option. The potential has always been there for Sharpe, but all of the elements appear to be coming together for a breakout season. One of the tougher things for a young, athletic player to navigate is understanding how and when to change speeds. Early in the preseason you can feel the growth from Sharpe in that area. There is more poise and composure, a combination of patience and confidence. We’re seeing a scorer play with an understanding of when and how to get to his spots against the space defenses are giving him. Sharpe is doing a better job of setting up his defender to get screened in pick-and-roll and, instead of hitting the turbo button to get downhill, he’s taking the space and attacking appropriately. The midrange pullup is there, but that attack can open up a kick, or a quick burst of speed can turn it into a drive. The more he can get downhill against closeouts, the tougher he becomes to guard. That kind of shiftiness can only open up things for him — and Portland — offensively. The sky is the limit if he is able to consistently mix the drives and self-creation. This is less about Cam Johnson the talent and more what Cam Johnson the talent unlocks for the Nuggets. It's the little things that can help them offensively. Running the wing in transition as Jamal Murray flows into pick-and-roll with Nikola Jokić. Seeing that action take place and diving from the wing to the block to take his man out of help defense. Forcing someone else to rotate which opens a kick from Jokić for 3. Running pick-and-roll with Jokić, kicking to the wing and immediately relocating for a 3. Backdoor cuts with a willing passer that put pressure on the defense. Those types of things have already stood out. The Rockets have added Kevin Durant to their roster, Alperen Şengün has gotten even better, Amen Thompson will get more responsibility in the Rockets' offense. I remain intrigued by what this season can look like for Smith. There is a clearer runway for him to have an impact on both ends of the floor, both with the starting lineup and mixing in with bench units. In the preseason we’ve seen a good mindset from Smith. Defensively, he has played with a high level of activity, switching and defending multiple positions. Defense is the base for the Rockets' success and the more he can grow on that end the better. Offensively, he’s continued to play with aggression, but it feels like it has more purpose behind it. If he gets a switch, he's trying to dive in the paint to get deep position. He's hitting first on his drives instead of solely relying on getting to a fadeaway. He's throwing the ball into the post and setting a post split to get involved in off-ball movement. It feels like his growth could be flying under the radar, but if he continues to hit the right notes that’s only good news for the Rockets. With both Tyrese Haliburton and T.J. McConnell out to start the season, it could be a moment for Nembhard to emerge. The Pacers will be different, but a lot of their principles will remain the same. Now is the time to see if Nembhard can build on the base he’s showcased the past few seasons. With Indiana's pace, tempo and movement, I do not think Nembhard will have to be the true “engine” of the Pacers offense. But there will be a lot more opportunities for him to impact the game offensively, and I want to see what that looks like. How much can he help the Pacers keep being the Pacers when it comes to pace/tempo? How does he handle being a larger part of a team’s game plan? Will the extra opportunities unlock a different level of aggression? We have seen the playoff production, the shotmaking, the defense, but this is a player who has yet to average more than 30 minutes a game in the regular season. The fit felt good when Cleveland traded for Hunter at the trade deadline; the team needed a wing who could defend multiple positions, knock down shots and drive the basketball. With a full offseason of familiarity in tow and some early injuries, is there room for Hunter to continue to grow? The shotmaking always feels important for Hunter’s overall impact, but this is a Cleveland offense that is built on pace and tempo. That can open a level of freedom which could allow Hunter to have more of an impact offensively. Does Cleveland work to get him the ball in different areas of the floor? Is there more room for him to drive or be involved in pick-and-roll? It feels like there is a real opportunity for Hunter to have an impact for the Cavs this year. Honestly, I am very excited to watch another year of Thompson being a mad man on defense. If you enjoy screen navigation, point-of-attack containment and overall activity, he will bring it to you every single night. But the athleticism and drives — and what that means for Detroit — is where the fun can begin on offense. Cade Cunningham runs the show, but Detroit values having shooting and playmaking on the floor. Can Thompson get consistent paint touches to force defenses to help and create advantages? Defenses may want to go under, but if he can turn the corner and become a pressure point, a lot opens up for Detroit. This one feels less like box-score growth and more like an opportunity for a player to really develop. New coach, new system and new opportunities abound in Memphis, and it’s clear they value what Wells brings to the table. There has been more of an effort to get him involved on and off the ball, and he’s shown an ability to space the floor. If he can continue to improve offensively, while being active on ball and pesky off ball defensively, Memphis could have a gem."}

It’s also a terrible predictive tool — don’t place your bets based on their responses ( might I recommend the clever folks at the NBC Sports betting page for your tips ). A year ago, 25 of the 30 GMs picked Boston to repeat (that was probably 26, Brad Stevens can’t vote for his own team), yet Oklahoma City won 68 games and the title — the GMs have picked the champion just once in the last seven years (the 2024 Celtics). So, is it a worrying sign for Oklahoma City that 24 of the 30 GMS picked them to repeat as champions? No, it’s more a sign of the conventional wisdom thinking around the league, which this survey certainly provides. Some highlights from the voting: NBA Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (80% of the vote). Cleveland and Denver were tied for second (7% each). East Champion: Cleveland Cavaliers (63% of voters had them first, 27% second), with the New York Knicks second (30% first-place votes, 53% second). West Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (87% of voters had them first). Denver was second (10% had them first). Who will win MVP? Nikola Jokic, 67% of the vote. The next three in line were Luka Doncic (10%), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (8%), and Victor Wembanyama (7%). Who will win Rookie of the Year? Cooper Flagg, who got all but one vote (and Nico Harrison can’t vote for his own guy, so there was one vote for VJ Edgecombe). Flagg was also overwhelmingly voted the rookie that will be the best in this class five years from now (just know five years ago the GMs voted James Wiseman that honor). What player would you pick to start a franchise? Victor Wembanyama (83% of the vote, which makes you wonder what the other 17% are thinking). Player most likely to have a breakout season: Amen Thompson in Houston (30% of the vote). Brandon Miller (Charlotte), Ausar Thompson (Detroit) and Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio) were tied for second. Which team made the best overall moves this offseason? The Atlanta Hawks (53% of the vote). The second choice went to the Houston Rockets (27%). Which one player acquisition will make the biggest impact? Kevin Durant to Houston (73% of the vote). Desmond Bane to Orlando was second, and also voted the most underrated move of the offseason. Most surprising move of the offseason: Milwaukee waiving/stretching Damian Lillard (second on this list was the Bucks signing Myles Turner, which only happened because of the waive/stretch of Lillard). Who was the biggest steal in terms of where they were drafted? In a bit of a surprise, it went to Kasparas Jakucionis to Miami, selected at No. 20. Tied for second was Ace Bailey to Utah at No. 5 and Carter Bryant to San Antonio at No. 14. Best defender in the NBA: Victor Wembanyama with 80% of the vote. Dyson Daniels was voted the best perimeter defender in the league. Who is the best head coach in the NBA? Newly minted USA Basketball head coach Erik Spoelstra of Miami, with 52% of the vote (OKC’s Mark Daigneault was second, and the Clippers’ Tyronn Lue was third). Which team’s level of success this season is toughest to predict? The Philadelphia 76ers got 47% of the vote (Dallas and Golden State were second and third). With all due respect to the questions around the Mavs and Warriors, how do you not pick the Sixers? Which player is the most athletic? Amen Thompson got 58% of the vote to finish first (Anthony Edwards in Minnesota was second). Here’s one I questioned a little: The GMs voted Stephen Curry the best leader in the NBA. That surprised me. Not that Curry isn’t a strong leader, but would you put him ahead of Jalen Brunson, LeBron James, or even the injured Damian Lillard? One other interesting question and answer: What rule most needs to change? The No. 1 answer was concerns about roster construction, specifically that the tax apron rules are too harsh, and that there should be a salary cap discount for a team’s own drafted players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 48-34 (7th in the West, lost to the Timberwolves in the second round of the playoffs) Offensive rating : 114.2 (16th) Defensive rating : 111.0 (7th) Additions: Al Horford, De’Anthony Melton, Seth Curry, Will Richard, Alex Toohey Subtractions: Kevon Looney, Braxton Key, Kevin Knox Complete roster The home-run swing for Butler completely transformed the Warriors to a degree that few midseason acquisitions ever do. He gave Steve Kerr’s club another avenue of attack, bringing low-turnover, high-efficiency isolation play and a steady diet of free throws to the party to serve as a perfect complement to Golden State’s tried-and-true Stephen Curry-centered motion offense. He diversified and strengthened the team's defense, pairing with Draymond Green to give the Dubs two high-IQ multipositional possession-wreckers capable of putting out fires all over the half-court. The impact was immediate, obvious and overwhelming: A .500 team with a negative point differential entering the trade deadline , Golden State posted the NBA’s fourth-best record , third-best net rating and No. 1 defense afterward. In the 43 regular- and postseason games following Butler’s arrival, the Warriors went 28-15 — a 53-win pace. In the 35 games in which Butler, Curry and Green all appeared, they went 27-8 — a 63 -win pace. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] They outlasted a young, hungry, physical and damn good Rockets team in Round 1, winning a Game 7 on the road despite Butler playing through a pelvic contusion and Curry dealing with a thumb injury , and took Game 1 of the conference semis on the road in Minnesota. It would prove a pyrrhic victory; as soon as Steph pulled up with a hamstring injury , Golden State’s fate was sealed. Even in defeat, though, its future path was clearly illuminated. The Curry-Green-Butler trio worked like gangbusters, and with the contracts of all three lined up for two more seasons (provided Green picks up his $27.7 million player option for 2026-27 ), the Warriors would try to maximize their potential of contending for a title right friggin’ now. “My headline is, this team heading into the season has got a great shot,” Dunleavy Jr. said on media day. So: In comes Al Horford , on the cusp of his 40th birthday, but still a supremely additive performer and hand-in-glove two-way fit with championship experience who, as Kerr put it, “fits any lineup, makes any lineup better.” (Big Al has already passed the first test facing any new arrival in the Bay: understanding that “the whole mindset is trying to make the game easier for [Steph].” Good start!) In comes Seth Curry , who shot 45.6% from 3-point range last season; who ranked in the 86th percentile in points per possession finished as a spot-up shooter and in the 96th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball-handler , according to Synergy; and who seems like a pretty good bet to slide smoothly into a system that his brother’s been running for, oh, 50 years. Back comes De'Anthony Melton , a two-way chaos agent who was a rotation piece during Golden State’s hot start last season before suffering a sprained left ACL and eventually being dealt to Brooklyn . Back comes Gary Payton II , a perpetually peculiar player who somehow manages to fit perfectly in Golden State, screening and diving and making the extra pass and guarding everyone with tenacity and alacrity. [ Get more Warriors news: Golden State team feed ] This, then, is the operating principle: Get as many smart players as possible — guys who understand how to cut, move, guard and pass, who understand how to play off of and maximize the three superstars — and see how it all shakes out. If, after a frostbite summer of sore feelings , the finally re-signed Jonathan Kuminga is willing to play a circumscribed role that fits into that framework , then that’s great news. And if he’s not … well, Jan. 15 will be here before you know it , and a two-year, $46.8 million deal could bring back pieces that more snugly fit the Warriors’ M.O. If everyone’s rowing in the same direction, and if the long-in-the-tooth centerpieces to whom Kerr, Dunleavy Jr. and the rest of Golden State’s braintrust have hitched their wagons can stay upright and operational, then we’ll have a chance to find out if what we saw after the trade deadline was just a small-sample-size magic trick, or if it’s sturdy enough to sustain over a longer haul. If it’s the former, then maybe we’ve already seen Steph’s last best chance at a winner. If it’s the latter, though, then we might be looking at a bona fide title contender. All the stuff I just said goes right! None of Steph, Draymond, Jimmy or Al miss extended periods, resulting in the Warriors finishing in the top 10 on both ends of the floor. GPII and Melton combine for something like a full season of havoc-wreaking, the supplemental youth — Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody, Gui Santos, young bigs Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post — gets in where it fits in around the aging tentpoles, and Dunleavy finds a Kuminga deal that bolsters the core. The Warriors finish with home-court advantage in Round 1 and, with a healthy Steph, a puncher’s chance against anybody they draw in the West. A roster carefully constructed around four of the NBA’s oldest players crumbles when those guys do what old guys do: get hurt and miss time. Golden State looks brilliant for stretches, but only for stretches, and none of that supplemental youth proves capable of shouldering a heavier load. No Kuminga deal materializes, and the bad taste of this summer lingers over an underwhelming season spent scuffling for a play-in berth and that ends before April’s out … and with Steph staring down his age-38 season, the end of the line looks to be approaching faster than anybody wants it to. Season opener : Oct. 21 at Los Angeles Lakers Complete schedule Start penciling in a couple of weeks of missed time here and there for their critical graybeards, and it’s not hard to see a world where they dip down below the mid-40s. If what we get is the version of the Warriors that ended last season plus Horford, though? Then Golden State should blow this number away.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 40-42 (eliminated in play-in tournament) Offensive rating : 113.7 (17th) Defensive rating : 114.8 (18th) Additions : Kristaps Porziņģis, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luke Kennard, Asa Newell Subtractions : Clint Capela, Larry Nance Jr., Georges Niang, Terance Mann Complete roster Trae Young is a four-time All-Star. He has averaged as many as 29.6 points and 11.6 assists per game. He has led his team as far as an Eastern Conference finals. And he is 27 years old — squarely in his prime. If ever there were a season for Young to take a step forward in his career — to move past the criticisms of his contributions as a winning player, especially on the defensive end — it would be this one. And if ever there were a team built to accentuate his game and mask his deficiencies, it would be this one. The Hawks added one-time All-Star center Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (among last year's Sixth Man of the Year candidates) to a roster that already boasted a talented rim protector and a cache of versatile wings. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Porziņģis will join Onyeka Okongwu in the frontcourt. Who will start is anyone's guess, but given Porziņģis' performance at EuroBasket over the summer, the guess here is that he will get the nod. Either way, Atlanta can field 48 minutes of quality rim protection behind Young, while Porziņģis also adds a layer of versatility on the offensive end. Young has never had a pick-and-pop option quite like Porziņģis. Nor has Young had this many versatile two-way wings to assist him on defense. In addition to Alexander-Walker, Atlanta features rising star Jalen Johnson, Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels and 2024 No. 1 overall draft pick Zaccharie Risacher. Luke Kennard and Asa Newell also joined the fray this season. The Hawks are deep and talented and built to support a ball-dominant superstar on his quest for a championship. The big question, then: Can Young be the best player on a serious title contender? We have our doubts, recognizing that doubts are what drive Young. He should also be driven by criticisms of his value as a teammate — levied by former NBA player Patrick Beverley over the summer. Young does have a tendency to make a game about himself, but he has also never had this much help. Do not forget about the matter of Young's contract, either. He owns a $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. He is eligible for a four-year, $229 million extension, which has not yet been offered. Is there a figure that satisfies both parties? It feels weird to go into a season in which the team has title aspirations (however long its shot might be) while the roster's best player is on a lame-duck contract. [ Get more Hawks news: Atlanta team feed ] Do the Hawks believe in Young as a driver of winning? That they must answer this season. And early. Because other teams will be asking themselves the same question, as they consider trading for Young. There are no good options if Young cannot lead this team into contention. What do the Hawks do, then? They can trade him, though they would have to find a team willing to give up real assets and pay Young. They could let him walk for nothing, freeing up cap space, though they have had no luck in big-name free agency. Or they could sign him to a fair extension, perpetuating a team with a sub-championship ceiling. It is so much better if Young is just awesome and embraces the brand of basketball that can coalesce a roster. Everything flows from there, because the Hawks would have their man, their team and real hope. Young is everything the Hawks imagined him to be, getting off the ball a little more on offense and digging deep on defense, and his effort on both ends sets a tone: The Hawks are here to compete. Johnson is an absolute star, maybe even an All-Star. They get a healthy season from Porziņģis. Risacher takes a step forward. Daniels is a menace. Everyone else is rock solid, and Atlanta has a real shot at winning the East. That's right. They could win this Eastern Conference. Whether or not they can beat whoever emerges from the West is another matter, but who cares, for Atlanta hasn't seen a Finals ... ever. Young is nothing the Hawks imagined him to be, prioritizing his own success over the team's. His business as usual on both ends stagnates the development of the young wings at his side — Johnson, Daniels and Risacher — and no amount of rim protection can guard against Young's carelessness on defense. Bad vibes permeate the locker room, and a trade is necessary, only Atlanta cannot find much more than nickels on the dollar. The Hawks take another step back in order to move forward behind a young core, which is not the worst of options, except that they'll need another point guard. And who is that guy? This is the catch-22: The Hawks may be damned to never win if they do keep Young and damned if they don't. Season opener : Oct. 22 vs. Toronto Complete schedule Trae Young is good. His supporting cast could be great. And what's the fun of rooting against a could-be contender? Take the over and hope Young is great, too. And he better be, because the team is built for it. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

In a sit-down with NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke for \"Dubs Talk,\" the Golden State guard reflected on why the 2024-25 NBA season was the happiest of his basketball life and how coach Steve Kerr’s leadership played a central role. In his exit interview last season, Hield summed up his first Warriors campaign by saying, “This is the most happy I’ve ever been playing basketball.” With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Asked why Golden State has been different, Hield pointed to the trust and freedom he was given. “They allow me to be myself,\" Hield told Burke. \"They allow me to be me. Previous teams I’ve been on, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy, but here it’s just a unique vibe than the rest of the teams. They allow me to express myself, and I was able to to play basketball with a lot of joy and not have to look over my shoulder.” Before arriving in the Bay Area, Hield played for the New Orleans Pelicans, the Sacramento Kings, the Indiana Pacers and the Philadelphia 76ers, carving out a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable 3-point shooters. In his first season with Golden State, Hield averaged 11.1 points and 1.6 assists per game, providing a steady scoring presence off the bench and spacing the floor alongside Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler.

Beyond the numbers, Hield described how the environment around him made the biggest difference. \"Everything was authentic from the coaches and the players, and it’s one situation where I just feel at peace,\" Hield added. That peace, Hield explained, stemmed from Kerr's leadership style . \"A lot of people say that coaches are transparent,\" Hield noted. \"A lot of coaches are not transparent. I think Steve was just 100 percent honest, transparent from day one, and never once has Steve given me the wrong answer. He’s always been straight up with me, and that’s what I like.\" The 60-year-old coach has built his Warriors tenure on communication and trust, winning four NBA championships while managing a locker room full of stars. Kerr, a former guard who played 15 NBA seasons and won five championships with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs, took over Golden State in 2014. Since then, he’s guided the Warriors through one of the league’s most successful runs. For Hield, that straight-shooting approach stood out immediately. \"As a basketball player, you love to be happy like that and love to play with that joy, and I couldn’t ask for a better year than that.\" With Kerr’s honesty and the Warriors’ support behind him, Hield enters Year 2 in Golden State not just chasing wins, but carrying the peace of mind that changed his game.

It is beyond cool that 40-year-old LeBron James , one of the greatest players in history, is on the same roster as Luka Dončić , one of the most decorated young players the NBA has ever seen. It is impossible not to think of their Lakers as a great team, if only because in our minds the two of them are that good. Whether they make practical sense as a championship duo is another matter. James is currently suffering from sciatica on his right side , which will cost him the start of the season. This is not news that inspires much confidence in James' ability to hold up his end of that bargain between two max-salaried co-stars. Meanwhile, Dončić is a 26-year-old who appears to be in the best shape of his life . One makes sense to build around. The other? He will be, at some point soon — if not now — just hoping the bottom doesn't fall out on his career. As difficult as it may be, the Lakers have to consider whether it is wise to spend any more of Dončić's prime investing in the chance that James could still be who Dončić needs him to be. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Already, James is no longer the defensive stalwart he once was, not even close, and Dončić has never been known for his defense. Offensively, there is also a ton of overlap among their skill sets as ball-dominant superstars. There is reason for skepticism — reason to ask: Can they still maximize each other? They are, of course, also two of the greatest offensive minds the game has ever seen, and they will figure a lot of things out. They will win a lot of games, so long as James can get healthy, but can they win a title? The defense is a hindrance to that goal. Their third-best player, Austin Reaves, is no stopper. Nor is Deandre Ayton. The Lakers did sign one-time Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart, but at age 31 he has not displayed the same on-ball dynamism he once did. This is going to be a porous defensive team. They ranked 17th on that end last season and lost Dorian Finney-Smith, their best defensive player. Remember: Dončić and James took the floor together in the first round of last season's playoffs, losing in five games as favorites to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Los Angles did little to address its fatal flaw. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] The Dallas Mavericks built a team of two-way talents around Dončić and Kyrie Irving to reach the 2024 NBA Finals. The Lakers will eventually have do the same around Dončić in L.A., but they have not done that. Reaves and Ayton have a lot of potential between them, but little of it is on the defensive end. In Dončić's case, there is time to fix this. He is entering his prime and signed a three-year, $160.8 million contract extension. James does not have any of those luxuries. He will turn 41 years old in December, his contract expires at the end of this season, and we have no idea when Father Time will come for James. If, indeed, it becomes clear that this roster is not one with which Dončić can win a championship, what do the Lakers do? Do they try to reconfigure it around Dončić and James on the fly in the narrow window that they have together, dealing a 27-year-old Reaves and draft picks in search of two-way contributors? That has a real possibility of backfiring. Make moves in desperation, and the Lakers could easily find themselves in a post-LeBron era without any flexibility on the trade market, trying to field a competitive team around Dončić. Take a step back, and the plan becomes much clearer: Focus on Dončić — now. Build around him the way you would around a young James, and you know what a young James would do? Trade the 40-year-old aging superstar whose $52.6 million salary is a deterrent to building a title team around its best player. That, or let him walk in free agency at season's end, freeing up the kind of salary-cap space that could be committed to a more age-appropriate playing partner in Los Angeles. This is L.A., after all, and these are the Lakers. Someone will want to join Dončić on this ride. It is unclear if James even wants to be that guy, as his agent, Rich Paul, issued the following cryptic statement this past June: \"We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage of his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.\" What is best for James may not be what is best for Dončić, and the Lakers will soon have to choose sides. What that looks like in the short-term is anyone's guess, but one of their superstars is just beginning his L.A. story, while the other is scripting its end. Threading the needle between them may be a fool's errand."}

Kuminga added that what stood out most during negotiations was the way those leaders shared their perspective, teaching him about the contract process and giving him patience when he needed it most. \"I spoke to Buddy. I spoke to Draymond. I spoke to Jimmy. I spoke to Steph,\" Kuminga added. \"All of them. I had a 20-plus type of conversations of how contracts work, how to feel about certain things. They were teaching me certain things.\" That mentorship became especially important when Kuminga missed the Warriors’ players-only minicamp in San Diego.

The 23-year-old forward’s role has fluctuated throughout his career, especially after Golden State acquired star forward Jimmy Butler last season. That fluctuation has created some uncertainty for Kuminga and created a big contention point during the offseason’s contract negotiations. Kuminga, speaking to Andscape’s Marc J. Spears , said he is choosing not to worry about his role. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “I don’t ask [Warriors coach Steve Kerr] about roles because I know what he is going to tell me,” Kuminga said to Andscape. “I don’t waste my energy. I choose not to ask because nobody is going to tell me. It’s whatever. You just have to find ways to do things when you get out there. Make plays, defend. I don’t have a consistent role. I just play a role where I make sure I play defense and run the floor.” When the Warriors don’t have superstar guard Steph Curry available, Kuminga has been tasked with being more of a focal point in the offense. But most nights, as it has been for over a decade, Curry is the driver of the offense. But that doesn’t render Kuminga useless by any means. Kerr detailed what a key supportive role looks like for Kuminga in an exclusive interview with NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke on “Dubs Talk.” “I think the role is right there for him,\" Kerr told Burke. \"We need JK’s size, athleticism on the wing, his ability to guard the big wing guys like Luka [Dončić], LeBron [James] and Kawhi Leonard. So, the role is right there for him. I know it hasn't always been easy for him because he’s wanted more of a role, being more of a focal point in our offense.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Kuminga does recognize this, telling Spears that he thinks his role is “to rebound, play defense and run the floor,” while also saying that he doesn’t “stress myself about it or think about” variations in playing time from game to game. Nevertheless, Kuminga and his camp feel that he can reach All-Star level play with a starting role . Kerr, speaking to Andscape, acknowledged that wasn’t in the mix. “It’s been an interesting fit. He’s made it pretty clear that he wants the ball and an opportunity that a lot of his cohorts get and people that were drafted near him. And we weren’t able to offer that,” Kerr said to Andscape. “We were a championship team. We won the title his rookie year [2021-22] and have been in the mix the last few years. So, it’s been tough. I respect the fact that he is competing and fighting in a set of circumstances that maybe isn’t ideal for him. But the thing I keep telling him is he can play a role for us, absolutely, with his size, speed and athleticism. “He can play an important role on a very good team. He just turned 23 [on Monday]. He has plenty of basketball ahead. One day, hopefully, he will look back on this as a valuable time in his career. But I know he’s frustrated. He’s made it very clear publicly. I don’t mind that, but I want him to embrace the idea that he can be a part of something special.” In his four years of NBA service, Kuminga has averaged 12.5 points per game with a 50.7 field goal percentage in 22.0 minutes per game.

He has come close twice, reaching the NBA Finals with the Miami Heat, but the six-time All-Star still hasn’t won the ultimate prize. After joining Golden State at the 2025 NBA trade deadline in February, Butler now is in his first full year with the team — and he made clear that his top motivation isn’t silencing his own doubters, but securing another legacy-defining title for Steph Curry and Draymond Green. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “It would mean the world to me, but it would mean the world to me if they won,\" Butler told NBC Sports Bay Area's Kerith Burke on the latest \"Dubs Talk.\" Butler understands his teammates’ résumés speak for themselves. Curry, drafted by the Warriors in 2009, already is a four-time NBA champion, two-time MVP and widely considered the greatest shooter of all time. Green, selected by the Warriors in 2012, also has won four titles and built his reputation as the franchise’s defensive heartbeat , earning a NBA Defensive Player of the Year award in 2017 and nine All-Defensive Team honors along the way. Still, history shows that a fifth ring would move both into an even smaller circle of all-time greats. Only 26 players in NBA history ever have won five or more championships. For Butler, that pursuit isn’t about collecting another trophy, but about cementing his teammates’ place among the legends of the game. Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. \"They’ve already solidified themselves in the basketball fame and in the league, we get that,\" Butler explained. \"But to separate themselves from other individuals -- you get five, like, you’re there. You know? No doubting, you can’t question it.\" The Warriors’ dynasty already has stretched across three distinct eras — the “Strength in Numbers” group that broke through in 2015, the Kevin Durant years of 2017 and 2018 , and their 2022 return to glory behind the original core. Winning a fifth title would underline just how adaptable Curry and Green have been at the center of it all. \"You can’t say, ‘Who was on your team?' \" Butler added. \"You’ve done it with multiple different types of players and rosters. You get five, nobody is questioning anything about anybody that got five.” If the Warriors do reach that mountaintop again, Butler will know he played a role in ensuring Curry and Green’s dynasty ends with no questions left to ask.

From Matas Buzelis to Amen Thompson, find players poised to deliver high returns.", "body": "Manage your account ... When it comes to preparing for your fantasy basketball draft(s), it is incredibly important to identify players who could be headed for a breakout campaign. Those types of players offer plenty of upside with the potential to provide tremendous return on investment for managers. In this article, we'll highlight some of the guys you should consider drafting who have the talent and opportunity to take a leap during the 2025-26 season. Buzelis has been a popular choice as a potential breakout candidate for his hometown Chicago Bulls after a strong Summer League. The 20-year-old continued that momentum in his two preseason outings so far, posting averages of 15.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 0.5 steals and 1.0 blocks on 55.6/40.0/75.0 shooting splits in 18.6 minutes. He didn't start a game until after the All-Star break last year as a rookie, but Buzelis is expected to take over as a full-time starter in Year 2. Over his final 27 games in the first unit in 2024-25, Buzelis put up 13.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.1 blocks in just 26.8 minutes a night. He should certainly see an increase in playing time as a sophomore, and in an up-tempo offense with Josh Giddey at the helm, Buzelis' speed and athleticism will be on full display. With a year under his belt and growing self-confidence, he'll get every opportunity to improve upon his preseason success as a two-way difference-maker. It might be difficult to think of Mobley as a breakout candidate after he won the 2024-25 Defensive Player of the Year award, but the forward-center is ready to make another jump at both ends of the court as he enters his fifth season as a pro. Through his first four years with the Cavs, he's never averaged more than 12.8 field goal attempts a night. In 2025-26, coach Kenny Atkinson, Mobley and Donovan Mitchell have talked extensively about the 24-year-old demanding the ball on offense while making a concerted effort to run more offense through the big man. In limited preseason action, Mobley has been on-ball a bit more, recording a 27.9% usage rate in 44 total minutes across two outings. The sample size is small, but with Cleveland expected to be missing two-time All-Star Darius Garland (toe) and Max Strus (foot) for extended periods, Mobley will be tasked with more offensive responsibilities than in previous years. After averaging 18.5 points, 9.3 boards, 0.9 steals and 1.6 blocks over 71 appearances last season, it wouldn't be surprising to see him eclipse 20.0 points and 10.0 rebounds while chipping in a steal and at least one block per contest. Now that Al Horford is no longer in Beantown, Queta is set to be the starting center for the Celtics in 2025-26. The Portugal native represented his country in EuroBasket 2025 this past summer, posting a stellar 23-point, 18-rebound outing in an upset victory over the reigning European champions Spain. This isn't to suggest Queta will be going off with similar performances in the NBA this season. What it does prove, however, is that he's a talented seven-footer who will earn the most playing time of his young career as he enters his fifth season. In 13.9 minutes per game last year, Queta averaged 5.0 points, 3.8 boards and 0.7 blocks, numbers that jump to 12.9 points, 9.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per 36 minutes. He probably won't see that much time on the court every night, but averaging a double-double with some defensive stats while shooting north of 60% from the field should absolutely be in the cards for the 26-year-old. Sensabaugh is entering his third season in the NBA. Historically speaking, players experience a breakthrough as a pro at this time in their careers. After suiting up for only 32 games as a rookie in 2023-24, he appeared in 71 contests for the Jazz last year and impressed over the final two months of the season. In 27 games after the All-Star break, Sensabaugh tallied 14.1 points, 3.7 boards, 2.1 assists and 0.7 steals on 47.4/47.5/86.7 shooting splits in just under 25 minutes per night. Utah made several moves in the offseason to make way for their young talent in 2025-26, and Sensabaugh stands to benefit as the starting small forward for coach Will Hardy in Year 3. During his lone preseason outing against Houston on October 8, Sensabaugh dropped 24 points (9-15 FG) with six made 3s, three rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 26 minutes. Much like Evan Mobley on this list, some readers may take umbrage with Thompson's placement as a breakout on this list after he seemingly did so last season by averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 boards, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks across 69 games as a sophomore. In Year 3, Amen is poised for another big jump, one that should land him firmly in the All-Star and Most Improved Player conversations. With the unfortunate news that Fred VanVleet could miss the entire 2025-26 campaign after tearing his ACL in late September, Thompson has the chance to earn heavy minutes as the lead ball-handler on a team featuring Kevin Durant, Alperen Sengun and Jabari Smith. As one of the most explosive athletes in the NBA, Thompson is a dynamic two-way force that will wreak havoc for the Rockets and provide stellar production in nearly every statistical category for fantasy managers. He may not necessarily help in terms of three-pointers or free-throw percentage, but his positional versatility, defensive stats and all-around game are too juicy to pass up. Heading into Year 2, Kel'el Ware looks ready to make an impact at both ends of the floor for the Heat. In somewhat of an up-and-down rookie season, the seven-footer started to show signs of growth over the last two months that he carried into Summer League and now the preseason. Over his final 26 contests in 2024-25, Ware averaged 10.3 points, 9.7 boards, 0.7 steals and 1.3 blocks in 26.8 minutes, compiling nine double-doubles in the process. Across three preseason appearances in 2025-26, Ware has recorded two double-doubles while scoring in double figures in each outing, and he's gone 6-for-12 on three-point attempts overall. In a loss to the Spurs on October 8, he erupted for 29 points (12-19 FG, 3-6 3Pt), 12 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 26 minutes of action. Targeting Ware towards the latter stages of drafts could pay huge dividends for managers, regardless of his status as a starter or reserve in Miami."}

Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024.

James, 40, signed a new contract with the Lakers in June and is set to become the first player to play across 23 separate NBA seasons. Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer.

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold.

James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games.

The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

Here are the various pathways for LeBron and the Lakers for the 2025-26 campaign.", "body": "Brian Windhorst analyzes LeBron James' \"The Second Decision\" ad, and Shams Charania gives an update on James' glute injury. (1:48) The only signs of LeBron James inside the locker room an hour before the Los Angeles Lakers ' preseason opener tipped off in Palm Desert, California, last week were his gold No. 23 uniform hanging in his cubby and a triangular foam cushion placed on the seat beneath it. The jersey would not be needed on this night. The cushion would. Of the 42 players listed on the Lakers' and Phoenix Suns' training camp rosters, 22 were born in the 2000s and 19 were born in the 1990s. And one, James, was born in 1984 -- five months before Suns head coach Jordan Ott. The 40-year-old James didn't play in the exhibition game after being limited to light shooting through the first three days of training camp because of nerve irritation in his glute, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. The cushion, though, worked a full night, as his seat in the locker room and during the game at the end of the bench. When James eventually emerged in the locker room, wearing a T-shirt with the \"Forever King\" tagline from his latest Nike ad campaign printed on the front, he was asked by a reporter if he was ready to begin an unprecedented 23rd season. Before James could answer, Lakers guard Austin Reaves chimed in. \"You got another five seasons in you,\" he said. James' eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face. \"Why not six or seven, get to 30?\" the reporter continued. \"Yeah, set a record!\" Reaves added. James turned toward Reaves and smirked: \"I already set a record.\" Indeed, there have been approximately 5,000 players to suit up in the NBA, and James is the only one to stick around for 23 seasons. He has also scored more regular-season points than anyone else in league history (42,184), scored more postseason points (8,289), made more All-Star games (21) and was a part of the first active father-son duo to share the court as players together when he and Bronny James checked in against the Minnesota Timberwolves on opening night last fall.

Wright Wemby, Luka, Ant? Examining the players primed to become the face of the NBA Zach Kram 2 Related The accomplishments -- including the four MVPs, four championships and four Finals MVPs -- are well-documented. But if L.A. represents the fourth quarter of James' career after the first three were spent in Cleveland, Miami and Cleveland once more, the question now is whether the clock is truly running out -- or if he will push this thing to overtime. As James embarks on his eighth season with the Lakers -- the longest consecutive stint he's had with any of the franchises he's played for -- he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time after he exercised his $52.6 million option for the 2025-26 season in June without negotiating for an extension. During the Lakers' annual media day last week, the first question James fielded was about retirement. \"I don't know,\" said James, who earned second-team All-NBA honors in his 22nd season. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to play the game that I love for another season. And however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested. Because, like you said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later.\" The Lakers, who will be without James for the next three to four weeks as he deals with sciatica in his right side, are coming off a season in which they traded for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic and secured the No. 3 seed in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. But they fell to the No. 6-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. After James opted into his contract to stay in L.A., his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, issued a statement to ESPN's Shams Charania that many interpreted as an indication that James could finish his career somewhere else. \"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. ... We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.\" And after having full control over his career for his first 22 years, what's best and what's realistic could prove to be at odds. Here are the four possible ways this unprecedented season could go for James and the Lakers. LeBron James is excited about his Lakers squad this season and isn't sweating being in a contract year. James' time with the Lakers has seen him battle a rash of injuries that caused him to miss 124 games in seven seasons after he had missed only 71 in his first 15 years in the league. The Lakers' brass has cycled through four head coaches and the front office has had a mixed record on its trades and signings. Still, there has been plenty of success. The Lakers won a championship in 2020, with James becoming the first player in history to take home Finals MVP for three different teams. The franchise celebrated James in grand fashion when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer in 2023. And in 2024, the Lakers used the No. 55 pick to draft Bronny, allowing James to achieve what he had stated as his last remaining priority when he told ESPN, \"I need to be on the floor with my boy.\" A few months before the 2024 draft, the Golden State Warriors inquired about trading for James. The Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested. After the trade talks had passed, James expressed his commitment to the franchise. \"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and [have] been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said. Lakers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka, speaking at his annual season-opening news conference a few days before media day, made it clear where the franchise stands. \"We would love if LeBron's story would be, he retired a Laker,\" Pelinka said. \"That would be a positive story.\" While several sources close to James have told ESPN that it is unknown how the end of his career will play out, it could help James' desire to play on the best Lakers' team possible this season if it appears he has more basketball in him.

The Lakers can trade either their 2031 or 2032 first-round pick this season and have the right to swap firsts in five seasons in any deals they pursue this season, but they could be reticent to use those assets to invest in a team built for Doncic and James, if James is on the way out. For those looking for clues, there are a few out there. The Nike \"Forever King\" ad features a narrator speaking about James' career in the past tense -- \"They called him the Chosen One ... We were all witnesses.\" The Cleveland Cavaliers' \"Classic Edition\" uniform for this season is the same style James wore when he came into the league as a rookie with the Cavs in 2003-04. The NBA schedule makers had L.A.'s first home game of the season and last road game of the season both be against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, a fitting way for the two most important players of their era to have a proper send-off, if James is indeed on his last lap. And after media day, on his Instagram account, James posted a compilation of moments from the day with Lenny Kravitz's \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" playing underneath, possibly hinting at the end. Pelinka's answer at the news conference about James retiring with the Lakers was telling because he answered a different question than he was asked. He was asked if the Lakers would be interested in re-signing James in the summer of 2026. L.A. is projected to have approximately $50 million in cap space, which would all be swallowed up by James if he was to seek a new max contract. James will be eligible to sign up to a three-year deal for $188 million, with a starting salary of $58.1 million for 2026-27, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks. As great as James has been, extending his prime well beyond any reasonable actuarial table, there is a natural question as to how his timeline syncs up with the team's two other best players, both of whom are in their mid 20s. Doncic and Reaves, for their part, love playing with James and want the partnership to continue, sources told ESPN. Both players have not inquired with James about when he plans to retire, sources said, wanting to show respect for James' process. Doncic, who idolized James growing up, has enjoyed their partnership and believes James is vital to L.A.'s ability to win now, sources said. He is also undaunted by any spectacle or circus that could come with pairing up with James as he closes out his career because Doncic already experienced an aging legend on his farewell tour when Dirk Nowitzki's last season with the Dallas Mavericks coincided with Doncic's rookie year. Doncic found the time with Nowitzki to be invaluable, sources said. Plus, if the Lakers happen to win the championship this season -- bringing James' career total to five -- would he see that as a perfect ending, or would he want to come back to try to defend it and tie Michael Jordan with six? Tim Bontemps remains unsure on whether LeBron James will continue to play for the Lakers beyond next season. Paul's statement to ESPN in June established James' final priority as the curtain falls on his career: to win. That means, if L.A. is struggling -- whether because of injuries, poor roster fits, or simply because the team isn't good enough to thrive in the crowded West -- James could opt to leave. Since James holds a no-trade clause in his contract, any deal would need a greenlight from James to be executed. The problem is, there are not many viable destinations for him. Play Fantasy Basketball this season • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Cleveland, which would represent a second and perhaps final homecoming, would need to send out nearly $90 million in salaries to make a trade work, according to Marks, and the deal would have to involve multiple teams because the Cavs are not allowed to be over the second apron in a James trade. Because of their apron limitations, the Cavs would also be prevented from signing James off the waiver wire if he reached a buyout with L.A. The Warriors and New York Knicks would also be ineligible to sign James in that scenario. Then there's the Mavericks. James has won titles with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving , and has close relationships with coach Jason Kidd and several members of Kidd's staff. But the Mavs, too, would need to send out an exorbitant amount of money to make a deal work, according to Marks. Dallas is also currently a second-apron team, and would need to trade $12 million in salary without taking any back in order to become a buyout destination for James. There are 10 teams projected to have significant cap space in the summer of 2026, including the Brooklyn Nets , LA Clippers and Chicago Bulls , and there could be options for James that are currently unforeseen. However, it would be a major life change to leave Southern California when Savannah (his wife) and Zhuri (his daughter) live there, Bronny is under contract with the Lakers, and Bryce (his son) is a short flight away at the University of Arizona. And James will be in a free agent pool that potentially includes other stars such as Kevin Durant , Trae Young and James Harden -- plus impact players such as Reaves, Draymond Green , Bradley Beal , Norman Powell and Coby White -- so it's not a given he would receive endless interest around the league. And so James' situation remains undecided, and it's yet to be determined whether his 23rd season will be a countdown toward the end of his career or merely the bridge to a 24th, or beyond. Or whether his body will make the decision for him. \"Everyone is trying to dictate when he's done and the reality is nobody actually knows,\" a source close to James told ESPN. James, for his part, says he isn't concerned with the future for now. \"Not worried about yesterday and not trying to focus on what the future holds,\" he told ESPN. \"It's about staying present. ... Because like I said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it is not as long [away as] 'The Godfather 2.' So I know I got to stay present.\""}

(0:58) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- While LeBron James is expected to be sidelined to begin the season as he recovers from sciatica on the right side of his body, the Los Angeles Lakers ' other superstar, Luka Doncic , said he doesn't feel compelled to do more in James' absence. \"I don't view it that way,\" Doncic said after practice Saturday. \"I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.\" So far without James and Doncic, the Lakers are winless in the preseason, going 0-2 against Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors . L.A. hosts Golden State in a preseason rematch Sunday, and Lakers coach JJ Redick said it is still being determined if Doncic will play. Sunday starts a stretch of three preseason games in four days for the Lakers, continuing with a road game against Phoenix on Tuesday and the second night of a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Redick said Doncic would play in two of L.A.'s remaining four preseason games. Doncic was a full participant on Saturday after having his workload modified all week to save the 26-year-old guard some wear and tear after he played for Slovenia in EuroBasket this summer. \"I had [the] national team,\" Doncic explained. \"Playing one month or something of basketball [for Slovenia]. Obviously it's a long season ahead, so just because of that.\" Now Redick has his work cut out for him trying to fill in for James while he is sidelined for the next three to four weeks before his sciatica is scheduled to be reevaluated. \"You hope that he's back soon,\" Redick said. \"Those things can be tricky. ... It is unclear what the starting lineup is going to be, that's the reality, until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.\" Doncic, guard Austin Reaves and center Deandre Ayton will occupy three of the five spots. It's the other two starting spots that Redick will examine, with Rui Hachimura starting 57 of the 59 games he played for L.A. last season under obvious consideration. Jarred Vanderbilt , who has started both preseason games so far and is the healthiest he has been since the Lakers' 2023 trip to the Western Conference finals and free agent signees Jake LaRavia and Marcus Smart give the team different options offensively and defensively. Smart, who has also been sidelined to start the preseason because of Achilles tendinopathy, will play against the Warriors, according to Redick. Redick said he has thought about having one lineup and rotation that fits best together when James plays and a separate one for when he doesn't. Doncic said he and James have \"talked a lot\" while observing the Lakers practice from the sidelines during training camp, which has helped with chemistry. For the time being, all Doncic and the Lakers will be getting out of James during games is what the 40-year-old can provide with his voice from the bench. \"It's a big change,\" Doncic said of having to play without James. \"He's a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be 'next man up.' We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be 'next man up.' That's it.\""}

The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks filed the lawsuit in August 2023, seeking more than $10 million in damages . The team alleged that the Raptors poached Ikechukwu Azotam, who worked for New York from 2020 to 2023, and ordered him to provide a trove of internal information after Toronto began recruiting him in the summer of 2023. The Knicks argued that this effort was geared toward giving the Raptors a competitive advantage. The Knicks specifically alleged that Azotam -- who worked for the team as an assistant video coordinator, then as a director of video/analytics/player development assistant -- sent the Raptors thousands of confidential files, including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The Knicks alleged that Azotam did so at the request of the Raptors, who they said were trying to \"organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff,\" the August 2023 complaint stated. The Raptors, Azotam, Toronto coach Darko Rajaković, player development coach Noah Lewis and 10 \"unknown\" employees were listed as defendants in the lawsuit. In an October 2023 court filing, the Raptors called the Knicks' allegations \"baseless\" and a \"public relations stunt.\" The Raptors argued that the \"alleged 'theft of data' involved little more than publicly available information compiled through public sources readily accessible to all NBA Members.\" The Raptors repeatedly called for NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in and settle the dispute, and a judge in the U.S. Southern District Court in Lower Manhattan agreed . The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, meaning it is dismissed permanently."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might have made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4-of-5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. He played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he would feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter by running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up, and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

(0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

He averaged 9.5 points and 4 assists in 23 playoff games to help the Pacers reach the NBA Finals. The Pacers were already short-handed at point guard with All-Star Tyrese Haliburton sidelined for the season because of a torn Achilles he suffered in the Pacers' Game 7 Finals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Andrew Nembhard will start at point guard this season in Haliburton's absence. The Pacers open the regular season on Oct. 23 against the Thunder in a rematch of the Finals."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: Is there any hope for Joel Embiid and the Sixers?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-is-there-any-hope-for-joel-embiid-and-the-sixers/", "published_at": "2025-10-11T15:43:33+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Philadelphia 76ers, who are on the two-timeline plan", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Jared McCain's rookie season ended in mid-December of last year, but he still managed to play more minutes (592) than Joel Embiid did (574) for the 2024-25 Philadelphia 76ers . The same is true of reserves Jeff Dowtin Jr. (621), who was on a two-way contract and also played 17 games for the Sixers' G League team; Kyle Lowry (659), who barely played for the final three months; and Jared Butler (682), who joined the team at the trade deadline. In all, 15 players logged more minutes than Embiid did for last season's Sixers. The guy who played the fifth-most minutes, Ricky Council IV , is not currently on an NBA roster. (The Brooklyn Nets were reportedly going to bring him to camp if not for an injury.) Paul George missed half the games, too, and, by the end of the regular season, they were in full tank mode, trying to hang on to their top-six-protected pick. For a franchise that had invested about $400 million in Embiid and George the previous summer, it was an absolute nightmare. Good news, though: 2024-25 is over. The late tank worked, and, if you're a Sixers fan who hasn't already purchased a V.J. Edgecombe jersey, you've likely at least considered it. McCain will miss the start of the season because of a thumb injury, and neither George nor Embiid has played in the preseason, but, in theory, Philly will soon get a proper look at the team it has put together. The hope is that the ceiling is just as high as the Sixers envisioned when they're at full health and that the floor is nowhere near as low as it was last season. Last year: Just about everything that could do wrong did go wrong until the night of the lottery. The miserable, 24-win season did have some silver linings, though: Tyrese Maxey improved his point-of-attack defense, McCain looked like the Rookie of the Year during the brief period in which he was healthy and Quentin Grimes , acquired for Caleb Martin at the deadline, played like the guy the Knicks didn't want to trade for Donovan Mitchell four years ago . Guerschon Yabusele becoming a fan favorite and Justin Edwards emerging late in the season were small victories, too. The offseason: They grabbed Edgecombe with the No. 3 pick, used the No. 35 pick on stretch big Johni Broome and re-signed Edwards for three years and $7.1 million with a team option. They also re-signed Eric Gordon and Lowry and signed Trendon Watford away from Brooklyn, all on minimum contracts. Yabusele left for the Knicks , and they used two of their two-way slots on Jabari Walker and Dominick Barlow, who might have a chance to take some of his minutes. After a long standoff, Grimes signed the one-year qualifying offer. Las Vegas over/under: 42.5 wins, per BetMGM Sixers believer: Nothing about last season was fun in Philadelphia, but, with the exception of winning a championship, it was the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. By bottoming out, the Sixers were able to draft V.J. Edgecombe, who is probably a future star and definitely going to help them immediately. Daryl Morey's front office also learned from all the things that went wrong in 2024-25, as they've put together a significantly younger, more athletic roster than they had a year ago. Everyone except Tom Ziller seems afraid to say it, but the 2025-26 Sixers can be contenders if they are relatively healthy this time around. I know you're about to hit me with the same tired, boring \"Joel Embiid can't be relied upon anymore\" take that I've heard a million times, but once he's back on the court and looking like himself again, you'll change your tune. Sixers skeptic: The reason you've heard so many people say Embiid can't be relied upon anymore is not that there's some sort of anti-Philadelphia conspiracy going around. It's just the truth, no matter how much you and I wish it were not. The Sixers drafted Embiid 11 years ago, and the only time he has ever finished a season healthy was 2019-20 in the bubble. Embiid himself has acknowledged that playing through his knee injury -- and Bell's palsy -- in the 2024 playoffs was not the wisest decision. What scares me the most about Embiid is not that he barely played basketball last season, but the way he moved when he did play. At this point, I don't understand how anyone could be confident that he'll get back to an MVP level, let alone sustain it. Sixers believer: I'm assuming you agree with this statement about Embiid: \"Everyone has to consider the possibility that no surgery and rehabilitation, no matter how cautious and thorough, will ever be enough to keep him on the court for long.\" Sixers skeptic: Yeah, obviously. Sixers believer: Great. It's from a Philadelphia Inquirer article that is more than 10 years old . Before you write off Embiid, please remember that, before he had played a single second in the NBA, plenty of people were doing the same thing. His injury history has always been a cause for concern, but he has already overcome it to be named an All-Star seven years in a row and win an MVP award. Please don't act shocked if and when he makes this sentiment seem foolish again. Sixers skeptic: Can we talk about the rest of the team? There are only so many ways to say that Embiid is a massive question mark, and pointing out that the organization has been walking this tightrope for more than a decade definitely doesn't make me feel any better about it. Weren't you a little spooked when, with Embiid and Tyrese Maxey out of the lineup, Paul George scored a measly two points on 1-for-7 shooting in 36 minutes in Brooklyn in February? How do you feel about George having arthroscopic knee surgery in the summer and Jared McCain vlogging about another injury ? I get the Edgecombe excitement, but aren't you a little disappointed that the Sixers didn't keep Guerschon Yabusele or re-sign Quentin Grimes on a long-term contract? It's hard for me to flush last season when this season's vibes are already weird. Sixers believer: Actually, I have some questions for you about the San Antonio Spurs : Weren't you spooked by how inefficient De'Aaron Fox was in the 17 games he played for them last season? How do you feel about him missing all of preseason -- and probably some real games -- because of a hamstring injury? It's not a great sign that Stephon Castle is already dealing with a bruised knee, is it? Are you sure that Victor Wembanyama is going to stay healthy after missing almost half of last season? To be clear, I'm not seriously saying that everybody should be freaking out about the Spurs, but it's annoying that McCain had thumb surgery just three weeks after No. 2 pick Dylan Harper did and only the former is treated like a bad omen. Let's respect the Sixers' history of genuinely insane stuff happening by not overreacting to minor snags! And by the way, San Antonio's crowded backcourt and collective lack of shooting are bigger problems than any non-health-related issue with Philly's roster, and the Sixers have the benefit of playing in the East. George is 35, but the fact that he remained an elite defender last season indicates that his decline has been greatly exaggerated (as has the importance of that one game in which he was dealing with three separate injuries). McCain won't miss many games that matter. Grimes can still re-sign next summer, and, as much as I'll miss Yabu, I expect Trendon Watford to more or less make up for his absence. Sixers skeptic: If every single Spurs player except Wemby tears his Achilles next week, I'd still feel better about their future than Philadelphia's. There's no double standard here; one of these teams has the brightest future imaginable and the other one will be paying Embiid and George about $120 million combined in 2027-28. What sucks the most about the position the Sixers are in is that, if you ignore those two signings, they've made some amazing moves over the last few years! They got Maxey with the No. 21 pick, McCain with the No. 16 pick and Edgecombe with a pick they weren't really supposed to have. The Grimes trade was highway robbery, the Kelly Oubre Jr . signing (and re-signing) worked out as well as they could have hoped and Justin Edwards looks like a nice find. Adem Bona might be, too, and, after Yabusele (another smart signing) walked, it made sense to pick up Watford. Unfortunately, though, there's no mechanism for a clean transition to the post-Embiid era, so the Sixers are stuck doing the two-timelines thing. This has already cost them. While it's understandable that they wanted to stay under the first apron and maintain their ability to get under the tax with a trade, these constraints prevented them from paying Yabusele and Grimes what they're worth. Compromising in that way was a tell: No matter what Morey says, the organization isn't really all-in on this group anymore. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors agreed to voluntarily dismiss a lawsuit alleging the Raptors stole thousands of confidential files from the Knicks, according to a court filing obtained by ESPN . The teams dismissed the suit with prejudice, permanently ending the legal dispute. The case was initially set to be settled this summer , nearly two years after the Knicks filed the suit in August 2023 . \"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved,\" team spokespersons said to ESPN. \"The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks alleged in the 2023 lawsuit that the Raptors recruited Ikechukwu Azotam -- who worked as the Knicks' assistant video coordinator -- and ordered him to send them confidential material including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The team sought $10 million in damages . The Knicks alleged that the Raptors, who had recently hired coach Darko Rajaković, \"conspired to use Azotam's position as a current Knicks insider to funnel proprietary information to the Raptors to help them organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff.\" The Raptors in October 2023 filed a motion to dismiss, argued that the claims were \"baseless\" and said the information was publicly available to all NBA members. They asked NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in, and a U.S. District Court judge ruled last year , to the Knicks' chagrin, that Silver should resolve the dispute. He was set to oversee the settlement in an arbitration meeting in July. It is a rare occurrence for NBA teams to sue one another. The only other known case came in 1977 when the Knicks were involved in a dispute with the Nets . They claimed that the Nets' attempted move from Long Island to New Jersey infringed on their territorial rights, and the Nets sued and claimed the Knicks were violating antitrust laws. The NBA and state of New Jersey settled the dispute, and the Nets paid the Knicks $4 million for the right to move. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Strahinja Jokić, the older brother of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokić, pleaded guilty Friday to charges stemming from a fight that occurred during an NBA playoff game in April 2024. He pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing and one count of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to one year of probation. The incident drew widespread attention after a short video of the altercation circulated on social media following the Nuggets' Game 2 win against the Los Angeles Lakers last postseason. The clip, which was later cited in a police statement of probable cause, appeared to show a verbal exchange between the Jokić brothers and a fan before one of the brothers struck the man in the face. One of Nikola Jokic’s older brothers punched a fan after last night’s Nuggets and Lakers game. 😳 (via cgallegos67/TT) pic.twitter.com/JdpNLxxjg0 Investigators identified Strahinja Jokić as the person who threw the punch. According to police documents , he told officers he \"felt he'd done nothing wrong because he was 'defending an older man that he has known for a long time.'\" The older Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault but ultimately pleaded guilty to lesser offenses as part of a resolution to the case. The incident did not involve his younger brother, Nikola, who was on the court at the time of the playoff game. Jokić's older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, are regular fixtures courtside at Nuggets games and have been protective presences throughout Nikola's career. It's not the first time Strahinja has faced legal trouble in Denver. In 2019, he was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman during an altercation inside an apartment. He was charged with second-degree assault , false imprisonment and obstruction of phone service, later pleading guilty in 2020 to felony trespassing and a misdemeanor count of obstruction. The remaining charges were dismissed. The Jokić brothers have also been involved in several public incidents tied to Nikola's on-court altercations. In 2021, they traded social media messages with NBA players Marcus Morris and Markieff Morris after a scuffle between Nikola and Markieff during a game against the Miami Heat . That same year, video surfaced of Strahinja and Nemanja shouting at Phoenix Suns players from the stands following a hard foul involving Nikola during the playoffs. While Nikola Jokić has largely stayed clear of controversy, his brothers' passionate support has at times drawn attention away from the three-time MVP's dominance on the court. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Former NBA star Paul Pierce was arrested Tuesday night on suspicion of driving under the influence after being found asleep behind the wheel on a Los Angeles highway, according to the California Highway Patrol. Officers were responding to an unrelated multi-vehicle crash that temporarily closed several lanes of the northbound freeway. As traffic lanes reopened, officers noticed a Range Rover stopped in the road south of the crash site. When approached, Pierce was asleep in the driver's seat, and officers observed signs of alcohol impairment, according to a CHP news release. Pierce was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor driving under the influence and booked at the CHP's Central Los Angeles Area office. The case will be reviewed by the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. Pierce gave his side of the story in an Instagram post , saying he fell asleep after \"being stuck in standstill traffic for 45 minutes.\" \"I'm old, I'm tired and I fell asleep,\" Pierce wrote. \"I'm good y'all thanks for the love.\" A post shared by The Truth (@paulpierce) Pierce, 47, played 19 seasons in the NBA, including 15 with the Boston Celtics . He also had stints with the Brooklyn Nets , Washington Wizards and finished his career with the Los Angeles Clippers before retiring in 2017. A 10-time All-Star and NBA Finals MVP in 2008, Pierce was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021. Pierce starred at Inglewood High School and was a McDonald's All-American in 1995 before playing college basketball at the University of Kansas. Drafted 10th overall in 1998 by the Celtics, Pierce became one of the franchise's most decorated players, helping lead Boston to the 2008 NBA championship.

It may just be the preseason, but third-year Oklahoma City Thunder guard Cason Wallace is already achieving the improbable. Wallace beat the shot clock with one of the most ridiculous shots possible in his team's win against the Charlotte Hornets . With just over 10:30 remaining in the third quarter, Thunder forward Jaylin Williams launched a desperation 3 as time expired on an Oklahoma City possession. It missed the basket, but Wallace was in the perfect spot along the baseline to heave a prayer as the buzzer rang out. That prayer was answered when his miraculous heave went over the backboard and into the basket.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . It's one thing to lose in the NLDS after entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. It's quite another to be eliminated in the most heartbreaking fashion imaginable , which is what happened to the Phillies in Game 4. After Philadelphia fought into the 11th inning of a pitcher's duel, the Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the frame. Andy Pages hit a little nubber back to the mound, and instead of trying for the out a first base, Orion Kerkering threw the ball away at home plate. Asked for his thoughts on the play after the game, Kerkering faced the harsh reality : \"This really f---ing sucks right now.\" Once the sting of this one starts to wear off, the Phillies will have to look ahead to an offseason full of unknowns . In particular, free agency could bring big changes to the Philly clubhouse. As R.J. Anderson writes, a few key players are set to hit the market, and the Phillies must decide whether they're willing to pony up in order to retain them. Misery loves company, and the Phillies weren't alone in the City of Brotherly Love . The Eagles lost to the Giants , and the Flyers dropped their season-opener. That's just the second time all three teams have lost on the same day. At least the 76ers didn't lose. Allow me to play the role of Captain Obvious and point out the LeBron James ' injury is a big blow for the Lakers as they begin the 2025-26 season. For more insightful reaction and analysis, we turn to CBS Sports NBA expert Sam Quinn. Could this James injury open the door to more playing time for Bronny James ? Who will start in place of the four-time MVP? These are some of the questions Quinn wrestles with in his piece on the ripple effects of James' absence , but the most intriguing question is whether this boosts Luka Dončić 's bid for the MVP. Even before this injury to James, there was some question about whether the Lakers added enough around Dončić to be true NBA title contenders. That question is only more pertinent now. Just as everyone predicted, the Giants faced the Eagles as 7.5-point underdogs and came away with a 34-17 win . As has been the case for the last few weeks, Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo led the way for New York on the field and in the vibes department. Right from the jump, Dart and Skattebo were locked in as they tormented Vic Fangio 's defense. Dart finished the night with 253 total yards and two touchdowns. Skattebo piled up 110 total yards and three scores. Those numbers are great, but they don't even tell the full story. In last week's loss to the Saints , Dart committed three turnovers, and the Giants committed five as a team. Those tanked their chance to win on the road (duh), but New York committed zero turnovers on Thursday. Dart's ability to avoid those negative and disastrous plays only enhance what's in the box score. The duo of Dart and Skattebo has a bright future, but they're already doing big things in the present. Jordan Dajani explains the multiple ways in which that big blue tandem made some history last night.

To be determined", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/article/luka-doncic-finally-play-preseason-232026872.html", "published_at": "2025-10-11T23:20:26+00:00", "domain": "yahoo.com", "summary": "Coach JJ Redick and the Lakers' superstar say he'll definitely play in the preseason, but it's unclear if it will be Sunday vs. Golden State.", "body": "Manage your account ... At some point during the Lakers ’ preseason, Luka Doncic will play in a game. The question is when. Even after being a full participant in practice Saturday, Lakers coach JJ Redick said that Doncic was “TBD” (to be determined) when asked if his star guard would play in Sunday’s exhibition game against the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. Redick said Austin Reaves will play and that Marcus Smart will see action in his first preseason game of the season. The Lakers will play six preseason games, three of them coming after the game against the Warriors. After practice, Doncic was asked when he would play. Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue “I don’t know yet,” he said. “We got to talk about it — JJ and my team. So, I don’t know yet. But I’m probably going to end up playing two games of the preseason.” When the regular season starts Oct. 21 at home against the Warriors, Doncic will not have running mate LeBron James beside him. James was diagnosed with sciatica nerve issue on his right side, the Lakers announced to the media Thursday, saying that he’ll be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks. James and Doncic formed a great partnership when they played together after the shocking blockbuster trade last February. Not having James to start the season has to be unsettling for Doncic and the Lakers. “It’s a big change,” Doncic said. “He’s a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be next man up. We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be next man up. That’s it.” Doncic will get plenty of help from Reaves, Smart, Deandre Ayton, Jared Vanderbilt and others with James out. Still, the assumption is that Doncic will have to carry a heavy load with James sidelined. “No. I don’t view it that way,” Doncic said. “I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.” James hasn’t practiced at all, but Doncic said that hasn’t stopped the two of them from figuring out the team can still function at a high level. “It’s not everything about on the court. That’s what I’ve been saying,” Doncic said. “It’s about chemistry off the court, too. So, obviously, now it’s a little more off the court, but while we watched practices this week, we talked a lot about it.” They had known over the summer that James had been dealing with “the nerve irritation,” Redick said, and so it wasn’t a total surprise James is going to be out with a sciatica issue. Redick said James has been on the court “every day” doing individual work. He just hasn’t been able to practice with his teammates. Redick was asked how James' inability to participate in practice affected his game planning for practice and going into the season knowing that he won’t be available for a while. \" No, no effect on practice planning,” Redick said. “And we haven't game-planned yet, so, no effect.” Redick had not put too much emphasis on his starting lineup during training camp and during the preseason games. But with James turning 41 in December, entering his 23rd season and being injured in training camp, Redick was asked if he could foresee having a lineup with James starting and another with him out. \" Potentially. Yeah,” he said. “Something that certainly has crossed my mind in the last couple days. Yeah…You hope that he's back soon. That's, those things are, those things can be tricky. So it, I don't think it's … “We knew this going into camp, so it wasn't like it's changed anything for how we want to practice or what our philosophies are with the preseason games. It is unclear who's gonna be, what the starting lineup is gonna be. That's the reality until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A spokesperson for the teams gave ESPN this statement: “The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved. The Parties are focused on the future.” The lawsuit was over something seen as commonplace in NBA circles (sources who had been in similar jobs told NBC Sports at the time that this was no big deal and the suit seemed “very James Dolan”). New York was seeking $10 million in damages from Toronto for the alleged “theft of trade secrets” when the Raptors hired away New York’s director of video/analytics/and a player development assistant coach, Ikechukwu Azotam. In the suit, the Knicks alleged that the Raptors organization — at the behest of rookie head coach Darko Rajakovic — took more than 3,000 confidential, proprietary files, including video scouting files and play frequency numbers. Part of the Knicks’ argument was that Rajakovic didn’t have the depth of background to build a team structure, so he stole that from New York. That despite the fact that Rajakovic had been a legendary head coach in Serbia, was head coach of the Tulsa 66ers of the G-League, and was an assistant known for player development with the Thunder, Suns and Grizzlies. Toronto’s first counterargument was that this had to be decided by the NBA league office and commissioner Adam Silver, not the courts. Toronto reached out to the NBA’s general council and pointed out that the NBA’s constitution (Article 24, bylaw “D”) states: “The Commissioner shall have exclusive, full, complete, and final jurisdiction of any dispute involving two (2) or more Members of the Association.” Dolan, who has had a long-running feud with Silver, did not feel the commissioner would be an unbiased arbiter of the situation. In the end, both sides just decided to drop the issue and move on. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Brandin Podziemski recently stated his desire to earn that prestigious role , displaying a level of ambition that is appreciated by general manager Mike Dunleavy.

So, we just want to focus on this year, putting together the best team we can do and we'll kind of cross the bridge of everything else as it goes.\" Podziemski voiced his lofty goal during an exclusive interview with The Athletic's Nick Friedell , detailing how warning that trust goes beyond just his skill on the court. “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told Friedell. “How can I have their trust?

The 22-year-old guard followed that up with another solid performance in his sophomore season, posting 11.7 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game in 64 appearances. While Podziemski certainly has displayed the desired traits you'd seek in a leader, his long-term role will be sorted out when the time comes.

He has the backing of the last guy to have the job, Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “I mean, Spo is incredible. He’s a phenomenal coach,” Kerr said after a Warriors practice Friday . “And, just watching him the last two summers and getting to know him up close, rather than just from afar, where I’ve admired him for so long, I got a first-hand glimpse at what a great coach he is.” Spoelstra was one of the assistant coaches on Kerr’s staff for the Paris Olympics, where Team USA won its fifth consecutive gold medal. That staff was also together for the World Cup in the Philippines the year before. Kerr said being an assistant coach for Team USA matters before moving over to the big chair. “I think the assistant coaching is almost a prerequisite for coaching USA,” Kerr said. “It’s really a different job, and now he has that experience, just like I did with [Gregg Popovich], in the World Cup in ’19 and the Olympics in ’21. “Spo is a perfect choice. He’s gonna be great.” Spoelstra is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA, entering his 18th season, and has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (2012 and 2013). In a sign of how respected he is around the league, a poll of NBA GMs voted him the “best coach in the NBA” as well as the best manager and motivator of players. Spoelstra’s contract with USA Basketball is not finalized and has to be approved by the organization’s board of directors, but that is all expected to be wrapped up before the end of the month.

See which current stars and emerging names will lead the next generation of fantasy hoops.", "body": "Figuring out where to rank players is difficult enough in any particular season. But how about doing it with an eye towards what the NBA may look like in five years? That’s the point of this exercise, with Rotoworld basketball writers Raphielle Johnson and Noah Rubin combining to put together their top-25 fantasy list for 2030. While the list is primarily populated with players currently in the NBA, there are a few who have yet to play an official NBA game. Some players, whether in the NBA now or yet to reach that point, will break through by 2030. Here’s our top 25, and it should not be surprising who leads the way. Age (as of October 10): 21 After taking the NBA by storm as a rookie, Wembanyama’s impact was muted last season due to a blood clot that sidelined him from the All-Star break onward. The 7-foot-3 phenom has been given a clean bill of health and is poised to usher in a new era in the NBA. Before his season-ending injury in February, Wembanyama averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.1 steals, 3.8 blocks and 3.1 three-pointers per game with 47.6/35.2/83.6 shooting splits. Age: 18 Flagg has yet to play in an official NBA game, but the incoming rookie is deserving of being high on any list that’s looking ahead to five years from now. He won’t turn 19 until just before Christmas, making it possible (likely, even) that the Mavericks forward still will not have reached his prime by 2030. He’s got all the skills a franchise could want in a cornerstone, which is a void the Mavericks need to fill after trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers. Cooper Flagg was EVERYWHERE during his preseason debut 🔥🔥🔥 10p/6r/3a/1b in 14 minutes pic.twitter.com/p8CGp8A6mF Age: 27 Gilgeous-Alexander, who won NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Finals MVP honors while leading the Thunder to their first title last season, is still not 30 years old. Yet it feels like he’s been around for far longer than that, with the Canadian point guard being the 11th overall pick in the 2018 draft. Who knows how many titles and individual accolades he’ll have on his résumé by the time 2030 rolls around, but SGA should remain one of the best assets in fantasy basketball. Age: 24 Cunningham’s production has increased in each of his four NBA seasons, with the 2024-25 campaign being the one in which his growth coincided with that of the franchise he leads. Appearing a career-best 70 games, Cunningham averaged 26.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 9.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.1 three-pointers. The Pistons point guard recorded career-high averages in points, assists, blocks and three-pointers with a 46.9/35.6/84.6 shooting split. If Cunningham can keep the turnovers in check, as he averaged 4.4 per game last season, he’ll be an even better player to have rostered in fantasy leagues. Age: 26 Like many who follow basketball, Dončić was stunned when the Mavericks traded him to the Lakers in late January. He appeared in a career-low 50 games in 2024-25, appearing in 60 or more in each of his first six seasons. While LeBron James remains active currently, the Lakers have already made it clear that the franchise has begun the “Dončić Era,” and this summer, he signed an extension that runs through the 2028-29 campaign. As long as Luka is healthy, he’ll be one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 Mobley’s fourth NBA season was his best, with the Cavaliers forward/center averaging 18.5 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 0.9 steals, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 three-pointers per game. His role on the offensive end of the floor expanded in the first season of Kenny Atkinson’s tenure as head coach, and there’s still plenty of room for growth. The only question is what will Cleveland’s frontcourt look like in 2030. Will Mobley continue to share the court with another big man, as he currently does with Jarrett Allen ? Or will he shift to center full-time? Age: 24 Like Mobley, Edwards’ position could change by the time the year 2030 rolls around. Current Timberwolves starting point guard Mike Conley turns 38 on October 11, meaning there could come a point in the near future where Edwards is either sharing the backcourt with Rob Dillingham or being utilized as an uber-athletic scoring point guard. Whatever is decided, Ant-Man has the skill needed to be a cornerstone for his franchise and fantasy rosters. Age: 23 Şengün, who led Türkiye to a silver medal at EuroBasket this past summer, turned 23 in late July. While his scoring average decreased by two points compared to his 2023-24 number, the Rockets center earned his first All-Star Game appearance last season and averaged a double-double for the first time in four NBA seasons. Şengün’s all-around skill set makes him a center who should be highly valuable in fantasy leagues five years from now, especially if he were to develop a more reliable perimeter shot. Age: 22 After taking on a supplementary role as a rookie, the versatile Thompson figured more prominently in the Rockets’ rotation last season. And with Fred VanVleet sidelined by a torn ACL, the 2025-26 season could be a preview of what’s to come for Thompson. Compared to his rookie season, the 6-foot-7 wing’s averages improved in all major categories while shooting nearly 56 percent from the field. Like Şengün, Thompson is in a position where things could get truly scary if he’s able to develop a consistent perimeter shot over the next five years. Age: 23 The biggest concern for Holmgren is the injuries. After sitting out the entire 2022-23 season with a foot injury, he was limited to 32 games last season by a broken hip. Sandwiched in between those two seasons was a 2023-24 campaign in which Holmgren did not miss a game. When on the floor, he’s a gifted frontcourt player who can be used at power forward or center, and that versatility will serve Holmgren well over the next five years. Age: 23 Like Holmgren, availability has been an issue for Johnson during the early stages of his NBA career. He’s appeared in more than 60 games just once and is coming off a 2024-25 campaign in which he was limited to 36 appearances. However, Johnson did finish last season with career-high averages in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots while shooting 50 percent from the field. As long as he stays relatively healthy, the tools are there for Johnson to be a highly impactful fantasy player in 2030. Age: 18 Peterson is the first of three players on this list who have yet to play a college game, much less enter the NBA. But the Kansas freshman is that good. A combo guard who can play on or off the ball, the 6-foot-5 Peterson is on the short list of many regarding the top draft-eligible prospects for 2026. Winner of the 2025 Naismith Trophy Boys School Player of the Year award, Peterson was also a McDonald’s All-American this past season. High praise from Coach B 🙌 Our 2011-12 @Werner_Safety Naismith Men’s College COY shares how impressed he is with incoming Freshman Darryn Peterson. 👀 pic.twitter.com/YZrxWsxzZM Age: 24 Maxey, who will turn 25 in early November, has averaged 25.9 and 26.3 points per game over the last two seasons. While there are significant questions regarding teammate Joel Embiid’s injury history, the 2024-25 campaign was the first in which Maxey failed to play at least 60 games. In five years’ time, he should be the cornerstone in Philadelphia and an elite player worthy of first-round consideration, regardless of league format. Age: 18 The 6-foot-9 Boozer, whose father Carlos enjoyed a 13-year NBA career, was a two-time winner of the Gatorade National Player of the Year award while in high school. The combination of build, athleticism and skill set makes the younger Boozer a player capable of playing anywhere in the frontcourt, and that versatility tends to make for an excellent fantasy option. Like Peterson and another player a little further down on this list, Boozer is projected to be among the top draft-eligible talents for 2026. Age: 25 While it remains to be seen how Haliburton’s recovery from a ruptured Achilles tendon will go, he’s already one of the best players in fantasy basketball when healthy. Last season, he averaged 18.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.7 blocks and 3.0 three-pointers per game while leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000. He’ll miss the entire 2025-26 campaign, but Haliburton should remain one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 After three seasons in which he played at least 70 games, Wagner suffered an oblique injury that limited him to 60 appearances last season. However, he was excellent when on the floor, providing fourth-round value in eight- and nine-cat formats. A healthy Wagner can be an even greater asset, regardless of league format, because of his efficiency and versatile game. Like a few of the players above him on this list, Wagner needs to improve his perimeter shot, as he’s shot 28.1 and 29.5 percent from three over the past two seasons. Age: 24 The reigning champion Thunder have three players on this list, and none are over 27 years old. Williams can be plugged in just about anywhere within a lineup; that’s how versatile his game is. Due to injuries, he even spent some time at the center position last season. Williams’ averages have increased in each of his three NBA seasons, and he earned third-team All-NBA and second-team All-Defense honors in 2024-25. He won’t be 30 years old until the latter stages of the 2030-31 regular season and still has not begun his athletic prime. Age: 27 Like Haliburton, Tatum is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during last season’s playoffs. However, the Celtics star’s recovery will be interesting to watch, as he has not been officially ruled out for the 2025-26 season. Will Tatum attempt to return? And how would that impact the next five years of his NBA career? Tatum already has eight NBA seasons under his belt, but he has the skill set that can make him a serious factor in fantasy basketball when 2030 rolls around. Age: 18 The third and final current collegian on this list, Dybantsa will also be in contention to go first overall in next summer’s draft if he declares. The 6-foot-10 forward will be the biggest story in the state of Utah this season, especially with the Jazz in the midst of a rebuild. Dybantsa was the top-ranked prospect in the Class of 2025 and is a three-time FIBA gold medalist. Dybantsa’s explosive athleticism and varied skill set make him a player who can have a significant impact in fantasy basketball by the time 2030 rolls around. AJ Dybantsa made his BYU debut tonight at Marriott Madness 🔥 @MarchMadnessMBB pic.twitter.com/yGdZqWHRBz Age: 19 The second overall pick in the 2025 draft, the 6-foot-6 Harper can be used anywhere on the perimeter. During his lone season at Rutgers, he spent most of his time on the ball but can also take on an off-ball role. On a Spurs roster that includes Wembanyama, De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle , that may be something Harper has to do early on, but he’s capable of progressing into a lead playmaker role over the next five seasons. Age: 22 The 6-foot-10 Banchero has recorded increased points and rebounds averages in each of his three NBA seasons, but turnovers have limited his impact in fantasy basketball, especially in category leagues. However, that should not be the case in 2030, when Banchero may be beginning his athletic prime. Five years from now, this spot on the list may prove to be egregiously low for Banchero. Age: 24 Despite his age, Ball has already played five NBA seasons. However, while production has not been an issue for the Hornets’ point guard, staying on the court has. The 2021-22 season is the only one in which Ball has played at least 60 games; he’s appeared in 47 or fewer in each of the last three. The injury concerns have knocked Ball down many fantasy draft boards; hopefully, that won’t be an issue five years from now. Age: 30 Jokić is the only player on this list aged 30 years or older. However, the skill set and elite production cannot be ignored, especially for a player whose game is not reliant on “jump out of the gym” athleticism. The Joker has been the top-ranked player in fantasy basketball in per-game value in four of the last five seasons, and no lower than second in totals in six straight. Will Jokić still be in the NBA in five years’ time? We’ll see, but the track record of excellence is why he has to be on this list. Age: 24 After earning his first All-Star Game appearance in 2023-24, Barnes recorded similar numbers last season. And he’s capable of doing more, provided he becomes a more consistent shooter. Barnes shot 27.1 percent from three last season and is a career 30 percent shooter from deep on 3.6 attempts per game. He doesn’t have to turn into the next Stephen Curry , but consistent shooting would improve Barnes’ fantasy profile, given what he can already do as a playmaker and defender. Age: 27 Young has played 73 games or more in three of the last four seasons, and most recently, he led the NBA in assists. Having averaged a points/assists double-double each of the last three seasons, the Hawks’ point guard can remain a fantasy force for years to come. Something to watch is how young players like Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels progress, as their development may benefit Young in the turnover category. He’s averaged at least four per game each of the last six seasons, lowering Young’s value in nine-cat formats. A Division of NBCUniversal .

There is notable mutual interest between Sacramento and the nine-time All-Star, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Friday on \"NBA Today.\" \"I'm told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings,\" Charania said. \"The Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that and he has got relationships across that organization.

We'll see if a deal gets done before the season or during the upcoming year.\" Westbrook's decorated resume speaks for itself, with an NBA MVP and two scoring titles to his name. While the 37-year-old guard is a ways removed from his prime, Westbrook appears to still have plenty left in the tank after serving as a vital cog in the Denver Nuggets' rotation during the 2024-25 NBA season. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game in 75 appearances for Denver in his last campaign, shooting 44.9 percent from the floor and 32.3 percent from deep. The Kings signed Schröder to a three-year contract that likely slots him into Sacramento's starting point guard role, but the addition of Westbrook could prove to be a vital step in insulating the team's backcourt for the marathon that is the NBA season. Sacramento opens the regular season on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 22. Whether or not Westbrook will be in a Kings jersey by then remains to be seen, but it certainly is something to keep an eye on going forward. Download and follow The Deuce & Mo Podcast"}

They also stayed winless in the preseason, falling to a 128-98 loss to the Magic in their first exhibition game at Xfinity Mobile Arena. VJ Edgecombe sat because of left hip soreness. He took part in the Sixers’ morning shootaround and is considered day-to-day, according to a team official. Other absences included Joel Embiid (left knee), Paul George (left knee), Trendon Watford (right hamstring) and Jared McCain (right thumb). Quentin Grimes was inactive two days after his first practice of the season. The Sixers will hold their annual Blue-White scrimmage Sunday and finish their four-game preseason next Friday vs. the Timberwolves. Here are observations on the team's loss to Orlando: Tyrese Maxey and Dominick Barlow were early standouts. The Sixers’ first basket came on a Maxey transition three-pointer. To no one’s surprise, Maxey came out aggressively. He fired up nine shots in under seven minutes and played with tons of speed and confidence. Maxey poured in 17 first-quarter points and watched the rest of the game. three ball courtesy of @TyreseMaxey 👌 pic.twitter.com/2f5ggfpiuc Barlow scored the Sixers’ next bucket on a put-back layup. He did strong work on the offensive boards in his third straight start and had 12 points and nine rebounds over 29 minutes. Barlow has a 7-foot-3 wingspan and good athletic tools, and he’s rebounded the way those on-paper traits would suggest. Notably, the Sixers plan to be a guard-heavy team and know they must improve their rebounding. Barlow’s boosted his case for minutes with his preseason showing on the glass. Well done for a 22-year-old on a two-way contract. Not for the first time, Adem Bona had a rough start on the foul front. He committed two personals in under two minutes, including on a Wendell Carter Jr. and-one jumper. Of course, the other side of Bona’s ball-hungry defensive style is that he’s often rewarded with rejections. His bounce and rim-protecting instincts popped as usual. Bona swatted Desmond Bane, Paolo Banchero and Anthony Black layup attempts in the first half. Bona with the denial! 🚫 pic.twitter.com/XYS4Kd1LQN Andre Drummond continued to play behind Bona. The highlights of Drummond's night were a pair of corner three-pointers. Drummond made three long-range jumpers and missed 17 last season. He’s 18 for 140 (12.9 percent) in his career. Hunter Sallis received first-quarter minutes and got an and-one runner to drop against fellow rookie guard Jace Richardson. The Wake Forest product tallied seven points and three assists in 34 minutes. The Sixers used a five-man bench in the first half of Sallis, Drummond, Kennedy Chandler, Jabari Walker and Johni Broome. Emoni Bates and Malcolm Hill checked in after halftime. Broome (six points, three steals) played at both power forward and center. He had some tough moments defensively against players like Banchero and Carter. Banchero tried to drive baseline past Broome and throw down a powerful slam. Broome stopped him with a clear-cut foul. The 23-year-old lefty's physicality and shot blocking were strengths in college. It’s an open question how he’ll adapt to NBA-level size, quickness and leaping. Chandler was the Sixers' lead ball handler for much of the game and had a 16-point, five assist, four-steal night. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse has given him significant minutes in all three of the team's preseason contests. “ He’s played very well,” Nurse said following the Sixers' practice Thursday. “ He’s got pretty good feel for running and organizing the team. He’s also got some juice to get by people and get to the basket. And he’s also a very good shooter. “ He didn’t shoot as much from three in those games as he’s been doing in practice. He’s a legit threat from three. ... I’ve been impressed with his knowledge of the game, the way he’s picked things up and the way he’s transferred that to keeping the team fairly organized.”"}

Even for Antetokounmpo.", "body": "Talks in August between the Knicks and Bucks about a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade never gained real traction. That shouldn’t be a real surprise. If the Bucks are forced to trade one of the five best players walking the face of the earth — and they would only do so if Antetokounmpo demands it — they will want back a massive haul of first-round draft picks and promising young players, two things the Knicks do not have. One other thing that shouldn’t be a surprise out of those talks: Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson was “untouchable in these talks,” something Sam Amick reported at The Athletic . Not only is Brunson an All-NBA player on a favorable contract, but he is also a fan favorite and hero in New York. Trading him would anger the fan base, even if it was for Antetokounmpo. One of the financially cleanest trade options between the Knicks and Bucks is Brunson and Josh Hart for Antetokounmpo, those salaries come within about $300,000 of each other and work under the salary cap restrictions. It’s also a non-starter for both sides — the Knicks aren’t giving up Brunson, while the Bucks want picks and young players to jump-start a rebuild, not veterans. Any eventual Knicks offer likely involves Karl-Anthony Towns and a player such as OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges (who can’t be traded until Feb. 1 and has a massive new contract kicking in). A mid-season trade of Antetokounmpo and his $54.1 million salary — to the Knicks or any team — is highly unlikely. Things get interesting if Antetokounmpo says he does not intend to sign the four-year, $260 million extension the Bucks can offer next offseason. If that happens, there would be a massive line of teams that would want in on an Antetokounmpo deal and many of them — Houston, San Antonio, Chicago and others — have the young players and picks Milwaukee would be seeking in a deal. Likely the only way Antetokounmpo ends up in New York is if he forces his way there, telling teams he will only sign an extension with the Knicks, and if these other teams trade for him, he will be a rental. Even then, like Toronto did with Kawhi Leonard in 2018, those teams still may be willing to take the gamble. For now, everyone wants to see how this season plays out. The Knicks rightfully see themselves as a team that can come out of the East. The Bucks want to see what Antetokounmpo and Myles Turner look like together. Houston with Kevin Durant, San Antonio with its young backcourt, and just about every other team wants to see how things look before making a massive move like trading for Antetokounmpo. Which is why it’s likely there is no action until next offseason. That’s not going to stop the chatter and rumors. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Strahinja Jokić, 43, pleaded guilty to trespassing and disorderly conduct after punching a Lakers fan in the face courtside at the Nuggets' Ball Arena. The trespassing charge is a misdemeanor, whereas the disorderly conduct charge is a petty offense. Strahinja Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault after video of the punch made the rounds on social media.

Recovery from sciatica tends to take more than a couple of weeks.", "body": "While the Lakers just announced this week that LeBron James is suffering from sciatica and will be out for the first couple of weeks of the season — at least — it turns out he has been dealing with this for months. LeBron first started experiencing sciatica nerve pain in late July or early August during on-court workouts, reports Shams Charania of ESPN on NBA Today . Here is what he said: “My understanding is this injury for LeBron, this nerve issue, first developed, first occurred, in late July, early August, during an on-court workout. So it’s now two-and-a-half months and counting that he’s had to deal with it and manage it. So even before the Lakers’ Media Day on Sept. 29 and the start of training camp, I’m told LeBron James had not done much basketball for well over a month prior to that. So it had been a normal routine summer for him. He’s a creature of habit, we know that by the way he maintains his body. So for him to be out to start the season and miss his first-ever Opening Night, it shows an admission by him and the Lakers that he needs more time to ramp up, getting into basketball shape, getting into the right basketball conditioning that he’s accustomed to. He’s not there yet.” Because of the pain on his right side — the sciatic nerve runs from the tailbone down the leg to the feet — LeBron has been limited in his workouts, both physically and on the court. Once he’s pain free, it’s going to take time for him to get his conditioning up to speed and shake some of the rust off his game. All that can take longer at age 40. LeBron will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, but could well be out longer. For the Lakers, that puts more on Luka Doncic’s plate to start the season. It will also start to give GM Rob Pelinka and the Lakers front office a view of what Austin Reaves looks like as the No. 2 option next to Doncic. Reaves can be (and is expected to be) a free agent next summer, and the Lakers have to decide if he’s worth it to them to pay him $25-30 million a season and keep him around, or if they should look elsewhere. How this injury heals — and what’s causing the compression of the sciatic nerve, whether it’s muscular, a herniated disc, or something else — could also impact LeBron’s decision about how much longer he wants to play. LeBron is entering a record 23rd NBA season and will be a free agent next summer, giving him a lot of options for what the final year or years of his playing career could look like.

Before that, he spent two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers wearing No. 31, and earlier in his career bounced between 30, 31 and 10 as he moved from team to team. This NBA season is the first time since Seth entered the league as an undrafted rookie in 2013 that the two have shared a training camp, finally taking the floor as teammates instead of competitors. The 35-year-old joined the Warriors on an Exhibit 9 contract, which allows him to participate in training camp and the preseason. Because of the NBA’s second-apron restrictions, Golden State will need to waive him before finalizing its roster — but the team can re-sign him as early as Nov. 11 while staying under the tax threshold. The lighthearted jersey swap at open practice gave Warriors fans a glimpse of the brothers’ easy chemistry — and a reminder of how rare it is to see both Currys on the same court.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James , who is suffering from a case of sciatica. The current timetable is set for James to be reevaluated in 3-4 weeks. Needless to say, this is a huge loss for the Lakers, who run the risk of being without the future Hall of Famer for almost a month, which could significantly impact where the organization ends up this season. It's no surprise that James offers production in multiple areas. He's a top-tier playmaker and strong rebounder, and despite being 40 he can still be penciled in for 24-25 points per game. But the stats only tell you so much. There's also the element of him being a 6-foo-9, highly versatile and extremely physical floor presence, which are now features the Lakers will have to play without. James' ability to get to the foul line, as well as the threat of him in transition, will force the Lakers to slow things down, and likely by a considerable margin. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] That's a lot of easy scoring opportunities suddenly taken off the floor, not to mention a big, wide body, who is agile enough to defensively rotate between the perimeter and the interior. This isn't to say the Lakers are out of the playoff picture before the season even starts. But it does make any race later in the year difficult if they find themselves behind the curve when the calendar flips to 2026. With James out, the burden falls even more on the franchise's best player, Luka Dončić. The Slovenian lost weight over the course of summer, and has been getting early MVP buzz based on his play at EuroBasket, where he looked more engaged defensively and had better stamina. Dončić is known as someone who can put up big numbers, and as a player the offense can run through. This hasn't changed, and the Lakers are likely banking on the All-Star to carry an increased level of responsibility with James out. If the Lakers somehow get out to a strong start and find themselves within the top 6 in the time they're without James, that is going to be an enormous argument for the MVP chances of Dončić, who has yet to win one in his career. Of course, he'll have to get some help for the Lakers to find themselves in that position. That's where Austin Reaves, who will unquestionably get more on-ball opportunities without James, has a chance to shine. The 6-5 off-guard has always been reliable, but the Lakers are going to need him to approach legitimate All-Star production with James out. Can he do that, even though his play tends to overlap with that of Dončić? Or will head coach JJ Redick stagger them to a point where both Dončić and Reaves deliver when the other is on the bench? There's a lot to figure out in La La Land, but the Lakers have on-court options to help their chances with James out, and keep their head above water. Of course, it does need reminding that when James does return, it shouldn't come as a surprise if the Lakers dip a little in production. Installing a high-volume scorer, who is also a heavy on-ball creator, doesn't happen overnight, which is something the players and coaching staff will have to ready themselves for."}

[ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Amen Thompson – G/F, Houston Rockets: Amen flashed elite rebounding and defensive instincts last season, averaging roughly 1.15 fantasy points per minute. Playing alongside Kevin Durant should open up lanes for drives and assist opportunities. The lack of 3s and forgettable FT percentage are the only two knocks on an otherwise elite fantasy profile. No Fred VanVleet means Amen and Reed Sheppard will be running the show. Tyrese Maxey – G, Philadelphia 76ers: The undisputed No. 1 option in Philadelphia, Maxey’s efficiency and scoring volume make him a safe bet in all formats. His usage spike ensures multiple 40-plus-point fantasy nights, even with the health concerns surrounding the Sixers' roster. Jalen Green – G, Phoenix Suns: Green’s move to Phoenix gives him the green light to score at will. With Devin Booker drawing defensive gravity, he's always available and has a clean slate to fire away — the exact kind of highly explosive player you'll want for High Score. Kyshawn George - G/F, Washington Wizards: One of the more intriguing deep sleepers, George’s size and floor spacing give him multi-position upside. If he cracks the starting lineup, his length and shooting could push him into must-roster territory. Shaedon Sharpe – G, Portland Trail Blazers: With Anfernee Simons gone, Sharpe steps into a larger offensive role after averaging 27.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 10 games without him last year. Although he averaged under 1.0 FPPM in 2024-25 (0.93), he looks primed to anchor Portland's scoring alongside Deni Avdija. With high usage and expanding playmaking, Sharpe's a breakout bet who will eclipse the 30+ fantasy-point mark per game in High Score and points leagues. Isaiah Collier – G, Utah Jazz: Now Utah's starting point guard, Collier has averaged 6.3 assists and 0.9 steals per game through his first 71 games, solidifying his role as the team's primary facilitator. He's my prime late-round selection for High Score and he could finish top-10 in assists this season. Jaden Ivey – G, Detroit Pistons: Ivey's return from injury has reignited his breakout path. He averaged 17/4/4 last year and he'll be the secondary scoring and facilitating option alongside Cade Cunningham. His blend of pace, scoring and playmaking makes him a High Score steal outside the top 100. With increased usage and a 30-point floor when hot, Ivey's poised to deliver the breakout season Detroit's been waiting for. Paolo Banchero - F, Orlando Magic: The Magic finally have spacing, and that means more playmaking for Banchero. I'm in the minority, but I think we'll see the best version of Paolo yet. With Desmond Bane in town, expect upticks in assists and field-goal efficiency with fewer turnovers. I still prefer him in points over 9-cat leagues, but I'd still get him in 9-cat. Trey Murphy III, F, New Orleans Pelicans: Murphy is one of the league’s best breakout bets for 2025–26. When healthy last season, he averaged 0.98 fantasy points per minute. His combination of athleticism, 3-point volume, and efficiency gives him a real shot at making an All-Star-like leap — both in real life and fantasy. Deni Avdija – F, Portland Trail Blazers: Avdija’s game has always hinted at versatility, and in Portland, he’ll finally be unleashed. After the All-Star break last year, Avdija averaged 23-10-5. Handling the ball more and attacking mismatches, he’s a glue guy with the stat diversity to post strong all-around lines. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Bennedict Mathurin – G/F, Indiana Pacers: Mathurin’s aggressiveness is finally being matched with opportunity. He can get hot quickly, and as long as he locks in on defense, he'll be one of those boom players who's ideal for High Score. He'll also be solid for 9-cat leagues. Zion Williamson – F, New Orleans Pelicans: Zion enters 2025-26 in the best shape of his career, motivated by a contract fitness clause and New Orleans' push to compete before their 2026 pick goes to Atlanta. He averaged 1.56 FPPM in 30 games last year and remains one of the league's most efficient interior scorers, producing elite per-minute output. Since turnovers don't count and ceiling games are the north star in High Score, Zion's a top-15 lock whenever he's active. Brandon Miller – F, Charlotte Hornets: Before his wrist injury, Miller averaged 21.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists while commanding a larger offensive load. His 1.01 FPPM pace shows growth as a shot-creator and secondary playmaker next to LaMelo Ball. He profiles as a multi-category wing with top-60 upside across all formats, especially High Score. Tari Eason – F, Houston Rockets: Eason ranked in the 91st percentile in fantasy points per minute among frontcourt players. His energy translates directly into rebounds, steals and buckets. If his minutes climb, he’s one of the most efficient stat-stuffers available after Round 10. Jalen Duren – C, Detroit Pistons: Duren’s double-double consistency anchors Detroit’s frontcourt. He's in a contract year and has shown growth as a short-roll playmaker. He averaged an impressive 1.23 fantasy points per minute last season, and as his rim protection improves, that number should only climb in his fourth season. Santi Aldama – C, Memphis Grizzlies: Aldama remains under the radar but continues to produce whenever given minutes. His shooting and rebounding profile make him a sneaky floor-spacer who can hit double-digit points and boards in under 25 minutes. Aldama will play heavy minutes to start the year and is still being picked outside of the top 100 on Yahoo. Isaiah Hartenstein – C, Oklahoma City Thunder: Always a per-minute beast (~1.10 fantasy points per minute), Hartenstein is being undervalued in the market across formats. He does everything but shoot 3s and make free throws at a high clip. However, I love him as a sixth- or seventh-round pick if I don't nab bigs earlier in the draft. Kel’el Ware – C, Miami Heat: Nikola Jović's hype is building, but I'm still targeting more shares of Ware. He averaged over 1.0 fantasy points per minute last season and has so much potential as a rim runner. His ADP is falling because he came off the bench in the Heat's past two preseason games; I would buy the dip. Dereck Lively II – C, Dallas Mavericks: Daniel Gafford is already hurt and Lively's ADP is at a very affordable price at 116th overall. With 30 minutes a night potentially on the horizon, Dallas' primary defensive anchor is trending up after a season where he posted 1.19 FPPM. Although his usage is low, he's a cheap double-double big man with boom potential on the defensive end."}

The gym on this day belonged to Jimmy Butler III . “He just had an incredible practice,” coach Steve Kerr said. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “He wasn't on my team, so I didn't like to see it,” Stephen Curry said partly in jest. “But it was indicative of the ceiling that we can get to with a guy like that. A guy who at any moment knows how to win.” Even Butler’s faux nemesis, Buddy Hield , offered nothing but props to the man who turned 36 last month. “Jimmy dominated practice today,” Hield said. “It was great for him. He looked really good and professional today. It was great. Great energy.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Though general praise tends to flow freely in every training camp, the reaction in this instance is highly encouraging for the Warriors. There are many stories of Butler dominating scrimmages in his previous stops, whether Chicago or Minnesota or Philadelphia or Miami. Butler’s infamous scrimmage with the Timberwolves in 2018 is one that made its way around the NBA. Three weeks after asking to be traded, he led a group of reserves to victory over a squad that included four starters, with center Karl-Anthony Towns often the target of his ferocity. Butler was loud, hyperaggressive and, well, a winner. That last trait is welcome in Golden State. Though there was no indication hostility, seeing him bring juice to a scrimmage warms the heart of the team’s established veterans like Curry and Green. For doing so with the Warriors, who belong to Curry more than anyone, suggests Butler still is capable of being The Man. That while he embraces being “Robin” to Curry’s “Batman,” – the roles can be interchangeable upon request. “I just think he took it up a notch today,” Hield said. “He wasn’t chirping like that Jimmy we know of. He was a silent killer, and his work speaks himself.” There were shades of that Jimmy last season, as Butler occasionally took over portions of a game, usually when Curry was off the floor. He managed to make a significant impact despite being the new guy, tossed onto the roster during the searing heat of a playoff chase. “Last year, Jimmy didn’t know any defensive terminology,” Draymond Green said last week. “We were just making it work.” Butler this season is with the Warriors for a full training camp, which followed team workouts he arranged in the days before camp officially began. He’ll miss the third preseason game, Sunday against the Lakers in Los Angeles, for what Kerr called a “wonderful” personal matter, but he is scheduled to practice Saturday in LA before departing. This was, in a way, a reminder. Butler putting together a “Himmy Lives” display can only be beneficial for young Warriors to witness and veterans to realize his back pocket contains plenty of what they hope to see once the regular season begins on Oct. 21. “He was very impactful, across the board, getting to his spots, (flashing) his competitive will,” Curry said. “Our practices have been at pretty high level. Not every day, scrimmaging, but he kind of built up to a good session today. From the jump, Jimmy was attacking the rim, dictating the pace on both ends.” This is the Butler the Warriors need to threaten teams beyond Curry, and every occasion he shows up will be greeted with delight.

As we inch closer to the start of the NBA regular season, we’re getting an early look at players and teams. And while we should take what we see in preseason with a grain of salt, there’s some excitement building. Now would usually be the time to tell you who is on the verge of breaking out in 2025-26, but I find that limiting. When I watch the preseason I'm intrigued by what impact players — from rising stars to established veterans — can have on their teams if something I'm seeing can carry over to the regular season. That’s the joy of the preseason, seeing the payoff from offseason development and preseason experimentation. Here are a few names to keep an eye on at the start of the season. The intrigue with Wembanyama comes from wondering what approach he will take in Year 3. There is a balance that comes with offensive versatility. On one hand, a team can use a player in a lot of different scenarios — on ball, in the post, as a roller, off screens. That type of sandbox approach can keep consistent pressure on defenses, as there is not one specific thing to take away. On the other hand, a team can lose the emphasis on a specific action on a night-to-night basis. One thing has appeared clear from watching Wembanyama in preseason: a change in shot selection. For all of his size and skill, Wembanyama averaged nearly nine 3-point attempts a night last season. Through two preseason games so far, he has taken exactly two 3-pointers. There’s a clear emphasis for Wembanyama to increase his paint touches and work to catch the ball closer to the basket. More attempts to drive the basketball, and more attempts to initiate contact, should result in a better balance offensively. Working to seal matchups near the post or elbow is a way to keep pressure on defenses. His strength will be tested as teams continue to be physical with him on drives or fight to push his catches out. Can he get to his spots consistently? What does that look like when he does? Keep an eye on his playmaking this season. The Spurs have worked to use multiple players as screeners which could open up pops for shooters or rolls when they go double big. Wembanyama appears to be making more contact as a screener while mixing in slips and quick rolls — knowing when to roll and force the weakside to help, and knowing when to pop to force a rotation. A quick swing or a drive against a closeout could keep an advantage for the Spurs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] On the defensive end, Wembanyama is always a sight to behold. In pick-and-roll, he can be near the level of a screen, drop back to contain the drive, use his wingspan to swipe down at the ball-handler and still recover to his man popping or rolling. If the offense takes that space as a chance to pull up, that can easily turn into a switch and contest. His size jumps off the page when he is defending on the weakside, sometimes seeming like he can remove a quadrant off the court with his presence. The rim protection speaks for itself (176 blocks in 46 games last season, most in the league), but I'm intrigued by how he'll adjust as teams work to space him and play off his rotations. Murphy made a large leap last year prior to a shoulder injury, but I believe there is even more room for his game to expand. Never doubt the combination of knowing what you can do and working to improve on everything else. The quick decisions and reads continue to grow. When he’s spaced on the perimeter or running in transition, the threat is no longer just a 3-point shot but a drive. You can feel that impact when he’s used off the ball in dribble handoffs or pindowns. If you are not physical and give him space, or try to go under, the shot is going up. If you lock and trail, he can turn the corner and get to the paint or to his pull-up. If you try to get physical, you open up backdoor cuts or curls to the basket. The Pelicans will need that type of versatility in the half court which pairs well with Zion Williamson’s ability to be used in different ways. Murphy has also been looking to initiate contact to get to where he wants to vs. only taking the space given. An improved handle could open up more opportunities in pick-and-roll where he can reject and try to get downhill. Pitch-and-catch action could open even more room for him. It will be interesting to watch what it looks like if he has the mindset to create space in different areas of the floor. It's not difficult to think of the ways Horford’s experience can help a Warriors team that features Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green. But the speed in which you can see it already has surprised me to a degree. The defense is what jumps off the page. Horford's scheme versatility defending pick-and-roll will add a level of consistency to the Warriors' defense. His ability to get to the level of a screen, turn it into a trap, drop and contain penetration is key. We have seen time and time again no matter the age, Horford is willing to switch and defend multiple positions, and late switches can help the Warriors recover. The Warriors having Horford’s help defense on drives or rotations on the baseline is one thing. Having that with Draymond and Jimmy on the court feels like another. Offensively, Horford’s ability to space and willingness to move the ball fits right into the Warriors' ethos. The passing can open up cutters and keep an advantage for the Warriors when they get a defense in rotation. He can be involved in screening actions on and off the ball. How often have the Warriors had a big who can set a post split and receive a post split? Mike Brown has brought more ball movement, player movement and freedom to the New York Knicks offense. McBride looks like he fits right in to the vision and is set up to thrive within the offense. Simply put, it is wise to believe in a scoring guard within the confines of a Mike Brown offense (see Monk, Malik). More pace and more tempo should open up more opportunities for McBride to attack offensively. More opportunities in transition to attack an early clock suits McBride a little more than bringing the ball up (slowly) and going right into a set. An emphasis on spacing should also highlight McBride’s ability to get downhill to score. The ball moving from side to side should allow McBride to attack a tilted defense. Combine the offensive confidence with the effort he gives defensively and that unlocks even more lineup versatility for the Knicks. Do not be surprised by three-guard looks with McBride guarding a top option. The potential has always been there for Sharpe, but all of the elements appear to be coming together for a breakout season. One of the tougher things for a young, athletic player to navigate is understanding how and when to change speeds. Early in the preseason you can feel the growth from Sharpe in that area. There is more poise and composure, a combination of patience and confidence. We’re seeing a scorer play with an understanding of when and how to get to his spots against the space defenses are giving him. Sharpe is doing a better job of setting up his defender to get screened in pick-and-roll and, instead of hitting the turbo button to get downhill, he’s taking the space and attacking appropriately. The midrange pullup is there, but that attack can open up a kick, or a quick burst of speed can turn it into a drive. The more he can get downhill against closeouts, the tougher he becomes to guard. That kind of shiftiness can only open up things for him — and Portland — offensively. The sky is the limit if he is able to consistently mix the drives and self-creation. This is less about Cam Johnson the talent and more what Cam Johnson the talent unlocks for the Nuggets. It's the little things that can help them offensively. Running the wing in transition as Jamal Murray flows into pick-and-roll with Nikola Jokić. Seeing that action take place and diving from the wing to the block to take his man out of help defense. Forcing someone else to rotate which opens a kick from Jokić for 3. Running pick-and-roll with Jokić, kicking to the wing and immediately relocating for a 3. Backdoor cuts with a willing passer that put pressure on the defense. Those types of things have already stood out. The Rockets have added Kevin Durant to their roster, Alperen Şengün has gotten even better, Amen Thompson will get more responsibility in the Rockets' offense. I remain intrigued by what this season can look like for Smith. There is a clearer runway for him to have an impact on both ends of the floor, both with the starting lineup and mixing in with bench units. In the preseason we’ve seen a good mindset from Smith. Defensively, he has played with a high level of activity, switching and defending multiple positions. Defense is the base for the Rockets' success and the more he can grow on that end the better. Offensively, he’s continued to play with aggression, but it feels like it has more purpose behind it. If he gets a switch, he's trying to dive in the paint to get deep position. He's hitting first on his drives instead of solely relying on getting to a fadeaway. He's throwing the ball into the post and setting a post split to get involved in off-ball movement. It feels like his growth could be flying under the radar, but if he continues to hit the right notes that’s only good news for the Rockets. With both Tyrese Haliburton and T.J. McConnell out to start the season, it could be a moment for Nembhard to emerge. The Pacers will be different, but a lot of their principles will remain the same. Now is the time to see if Nembhard can build on the base he’s showcased the past few seasons. With Indiana's pace, tempo and movement, I do not think Nembhard will have to be the true “engine” of the Pacers offense. But there will be a lot more opportunities for him to impact the game offensively, and I want to see what that looks like. How much can he help the Pacers keep being the Pacers when it comes to pace/tempo? How does he handle being a larger part of a team’s game plan? Will the extra opportunities unlock a different level of aggression? We have seen the playoff production, the shotmaking, the defense, but this is a player who has yet to average more than 30 minutes a game in the regular season. The fit felt good when Cleveland traded for Hunter at the trade deadline; the team needed a wing who could defend multiple positions, knock down shots and drive the basketball. With a full offseason of familiarity in tow and some early injuries, is there room for Hunter to continue to grow? The shotmaking always feels important for Hunter’s overall impact, but this is a Cleveland offense that is built on pace and tempo. That can open a level of freedom which could allow Hunter to have more of an impact offensively. Does Cleveland work to get him the ball in different areas of the floor? Is there more room for him to drive or be involved in pick-and-roll? It feels like there is a real opportunity for Hunter to have an impact for the Cavs this year. Honestly, I am very excited to watch another year of Thompson being a mad man on defense. If you enjoy screen navigation, point-of-attack containment and overall activity, he will bring it to you every single night. But the athleticism and drives — and what that means for Detroit — is where the fun can begin on offense. Cade Cunningham runs the show, but Detroit values having shooting and playmaking on the floor. Can Thompson get consistent paint touches to force defenses to help and create advantages? Defenses may want to go under, but if he can turn the corner and become a pressure point, a lot opens up for Detroit. This one feels less like box-score growth and more like an opportunity for a player to really develop. New coach, new system and new opportunities abound in Memphis, and it’s clear they value what Wells brings to the table. There has been more of an effort to get him involved on and off the ball, and he’s shown an ability to space the floor. If he can continue to improve offensively, while being active on ball and pesky off ball defensively, Memphis could have a gem."}

It’s also a terrible predictive tool — don’t place your bets based on their responses ( might I recommend the clever folks at the NBC Sports betting page for your tips ). A year ago, 25 of the 30 GMs picked Boston to repeat (that was probably 26, Brad Stevens can’t vote for his own team), yet Oklahoma City won 68 games and the title — the GMs have picked the champion just once in the last seven years (the 2024 Celtics). So, is it a worrying sign for Oklahoma City that 24 of the 30 GMS picked them to repeat as champions? No, it’s more a sign of the conventional wisdom thinking around the league, which this survey certainly provides. Some highlights from the voting: NBA Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (80% of the vote). Cleveland and Denver were tied for second (7% each). East Champion: Cleveland Cavaliers (63% of voters had them first, 27% second), with the New York Knicks second (30% first-place votes, 53% second). West Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (87% of voters had them first). Denver was second (10% had them first). Who will win MVP? Nikola Jokic, 67% of the vote. The next three in line were Luka Doncic (10%), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (8%), and Victor Wembanyama (7%). Who will win Rookie of the Year? Cooper Flagg, who got all but one vote (and Nico Harrison can’t vote for his own guy, so there was one vote for VJ Edgecombe). Flagg was also overwhelmingly voted the rookie that will be the best in this class five years from now (just know five years ago the GMs voted James Wiseman that honor). What player would you pick to start a franchise? Victor Wembanyama (83% of the vote, which makes you wonder what the other 17% are thinking). Player most likely to have a breakout season: Amen Thompson in Houston (30% of the vote). Brandon Miller (Charlotte), Ausar Thompson (Detroit) and Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio) were tied for second. Which team made the best overall moves this offseason? The Atlanta Hawks (53% of the vote). The second choice went to the Houston Rockets (27%). Which one player acquisition will make the biggest impact? Kevin Durant to Houston (73% of the vote). Desmond Bane to Orlando was second, and also voted the most underrated move of the offseason. Most surprising move of the offseason: Milwaukee waiving/stretching Damian Lillard (second on this list was the Bucks signing Myles Turner, which only happened because of the waive/stretch of Lillard). Who was the biggest steal in terms of where they were drafted? In a bit of a surprise, it went to Kasparas Jakucionis to Miami, selected at No. 20. Tied for second was Ace Bailey to Utah at No. 5 and Carter Bryant to San Antonio at No. 14. Best defender in the NBA: Victor Wembanyama with 80% of the vote. Dyson Daniels was voted the best perimeter defender in the league. Who is the best head coach in the NBA? Newly minted USA Basketball head coach Erik Spoelstra of Miami, with 52% of the vote (OKC’s Mark Daigneault was second, and the Clippers’ Tyronn Lue was third). Which team’s level of success this season is toughest to predict? The Philadelphia 76ers got 47% of the vote (Dallas and Golden State were second and third). With all due respect to the questions around the Mavs and Warriors, how do you not pick the Sixers? Which player is the most athletic? Amen Thompson got 58% of the vote to finish first (Anthony Edwards in Minnesota was second). Here’s one I questioned a little: The GMs voted Stephen Curry the best leader in the NBA. That surprised me. Not that Curry isn’t a strong leader, but would you put him ahead of Jalen Brunson, LeBron James, or even the injured Damian Lillard? One other interesting question and answer: What rule most needs to change? The No. 1 answer was concerns about roster construction, specifically that the tax apron rules are too harsh, and that there should be a salary cap discount for a team’s own drafted players.

He gave Steve Kerr’s club another avenue of attack, bringing low-turnover, high-efficiency isolation play and a steady diet of free throws to the party to serve as a perfect complement to Golden State’s tried-and-true Stephen Curry-centered motion offense. He diversified and strengthened the team's defense, pairing with Draymond Green to give the Dubs two high-IQ multipositional possession-wreckers capable of putting out fires all over the half-court. The impact was immediate, obvious and overwhelming: A .500 team with a negative point differential entering the trade deadline , Golden State posted the NBA’s fourth-best record , third-best net rating and No. 1 defense afterward.

In the 35 games in which Butler, Curry and Green all appeared, they went 27-8 — a 63 -win pace. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] They outlasted a young, hungry, physical and damn good Rockets team in Round 1, winning a Game 7 on the road despite Butler playing through a pelvic contusion and Curry dealing with a thumb injury , and took Game 1 of the conference semis on the road in Minnesota. It would prove a pyrrhic victory; as soon as Steph pulled up with a hamstring injury , Golden State’s fate was sealed. Even in defeat, though, its future path was clearly illuminated. The Curry-Green-Butler trio worked like gangbusters, and with the contracts of all three lined up for two more seasons (provided Green picks up his $27.7 million player option for 2026-27 ), the Warriors would try to maximize their potential of contending for a title right friggin’ now. “My headline is, this team heading into the season has got a great shot,” Dunleavy Jr. said on media day. So: In comes Al Horford , on the cusp of his 40th birthday, but still a supremely additive performer and hand-in-glove two-way fit with championship experience who, as Kerr put it, “fits any lineup, makes any lineup better.” (Big Al has already passed the first test facing any new arrival in the Bay: understanding that “the whole mindset is trying to make the game easier for [Steph].” Good start!) In comes Seth Curry , who shot 45.6% from 3-point range last season; who ranked in the 86th percentile in points per possession finished as a spot-up shooter and in the 96th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball-handler , according to Synergy; and who seems like a pretty good bet to slide smoothly into a system that his brother’s been running for, oh, 50 years. Back comes De'Anthony Melton , a two-way chaos agent who was a rotation piece during Golden State’s hot start last season before suffering a sprained left ACL and eventually being dealt to Brooklyn . Back comes Gary Payton II , a perpetually peculiar player who somehow manages to fit perfectly in Golden State, screening and diving and making the extra pass and guarding everyone with tenacity and alacrity. [ Get more Warriors news: Golden State team feed ] This, then, is the operating principle: Get as many smart players as possible — guys who understand how to cut, move, guard and pass, who understand how to play off of and maximize the three superstars — and see how it all shakes out. If, after a frostbite summer of sore feelings , the finally re-signed Jonathan Kuminga is willing to play a circumscribed role that fits into that framework , then that’s great news. And if he’s not … well, Jan. 15 will be here before you know it , and a two-year, $46.8 million deal could bring back pieces that more snugly fit the Warriors’ M.O. If everyone’s rowing in the same direction, and if the long-in-the-tooth centerpieces to whom Kerr, Dunleavy Jr. and the rest of Golden State’s braintrust have hitched their wagons can stay upright and operational, then we’ll have a chance to find out if what we saw after the trade deadline was just a small-sample-size magic trick, or if it’s sturdy enough to sustain over a longer haul. If it’s the former, then maybe we’ve already seen Steph’s last best chance at a winner. If it’s the latter, though, then we might be looking at a bona fide title contender. All the stuff I just said goes right! None of Steph, Draymond, Jimmy or Al miss extended periods, resulting in the Warriors finishing in the top 10 on both ends of the floor. GPII and Melton combine for something like a full season of havoc-wreaking, the supplemental youth — Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody, Gui Santos, young bigs Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post — gets in where it fits in around the aging tentpoles, and Dunleavy finds a Kuminga deal that bolsters the core. The Warriors finish with home-court advantage in Round 1 and, with a healthy Steph, a puncher’s chance against anybody they draw in the West. A roster carefully constructed around four of the NBA’s oldest players crumbles when those guys do what old guys do: get hurt and miss time. Golden State looks brilliant for stretches, but only for stretches, and none of that supplemental youth proves capable of shouldering a heavier load. No Kuminga deal materializes, and the bad taste of this summer lingers over an underwhelming season spent scuffling for a play-in berth and that ends before April’s out … and with Steph staring down his age-38 season, the end of the line looks to be approaching faster than anybody wants it to. Season opener : Oct. 21 at Los Angeles Lakers Complete schedule Start penciling in a couple of weeks of missed time here and there for their critical graybeards, and it’s not hard to see a world where they dip down below the mid-40s. If what we get is the version of the Warriors that ended last season plus Horford, though? Then Golden State should blow this number away.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 40-42 (eliminated in play-in tournament) Offensive rating : 113.7 (17th) Defensive rating : 114.8 (18th) Additions : Kristaps Porziņģis, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luke Kennard, Asa Newell Subtractions : Clint Capela, Larry Nance Jr., Georges Niang, Terance Mann Complete roster Trae Young is a four-time All-Star. He has averaged as many as 29.6 points and 11.6 assists per game. He has led his team as far as an Eastern Conference finals. And he is 27 years old — squarely in his prime. If ever there were a season for Young to take a step forward in his career — to move past the criticisms of his contributions as a winning player, especially on the defensive end — it would be this one. And if ever there were a team built to accentuate his game and mask his deficiencies, it would be this one. The Hawks added one-time All-Star center Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (among last year's Sixth Man of the Year candidates) to a roster that already boasted a talented rim protector and a cache of versatile wings. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Porziņģis will join Onyeka Okongwu in the frontcourt. Who will start is anyone's guess, but given Porziņģis' performance at EuroBasket over the summer, the guess here is that he will get the nod. Either way, Atlanta can field 48 minutes of quality rim protection behind Young, while Porziņģis also adds a layer of versatility on the offensive end. Young has never had a pick-and-pop option quite like Porziņģis. Nor has Young had this many versatile two-way wings to assist him on defense. In addition to Alexander-Walker, Atlanta features rising star Jalen Johnson, Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels and 2024 No. 1 overall draft pick Zaccharie Risacher. Luke Kennard and Asa Newell also joined the fray this season. The Hawks are deep and talented and built to support a ball-dominant superstar on his quest for a championship. The big question, then: Can Young be the best player on a serious title contender? We have our doubts, recognizing that doubts are what drive Young. He should also be driven by criticisms of his value as a teammate — levied by former NBA player Patrick Beverley over the summer. Young does have a tendency to make a game about himself, but he has also never had this much help. Do not forget about the matter of Young's contract, either. He owns a $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. He is eligible for a four-year, $229 million extension, which has not yet been offered. Is there a figure that satisfies both parties? It feels weird to go into a season in which the team has title aspirations (however long its shot might be) while the roster's best player is on a lame-duck contract. [ Get more Hawks news: Atlanta team feed ] Do the Hawks believe in Young as a driver of winning? That they must answer this season. And early. Because other teams will be asking themselves the same question, as they consider trading for Young. There are no good options if Young cannot lead this team into contention. What do the Hawks do, then? They can trade him, though they would have to find a team willing to give up real assets and pay Young. They could let him walk for nothing, freeing up cap space, though they have had no luck in big-name free agency. Or they could sign him to a fair extension, perpetuating a team with a sub-championship ceiling. It is so much better if Young is just awesome and embraces the brand of basketball that can coalesce a roster. Everything flows from there, because the Hawks would have their man, their team and real hope. Young is everything the Hawks imagined him to be, getting off the ball a little more on offense and digging deep on defense, and his effort on both ends sets a tone: The Hawks are here to compete. Johnson is an absolute star, maybe even an All-Star. They get a healthy season from Porziņģis. Risacher takes a step forward. Daniels is a menace. Everyone else is rock solid, and Atlanta has a real shot at winning the East. That's right. They could win this Eastern Conference. Whether or not they can beat whoever emerges from the West is another matter, but who cares, for Atlanta hasn't seen a Finals ... ever. Young is nothing the Hawks imagined him to be, prioritizing his own success over the team's. His business as usual on both ends stagnates the development of the young wings at his side — Johnson, Daniels and Risacher — and no amount of rim protection can guard against Young's carelessness on defense. Bad vibes permeate the locker room, and a trade is necessary, only Atlanta cannot find much more than nickels on the dollar. The Hawks take another step back in order to move forward behind a young core, which is not the worst of options, except that they'll need another point guard. And who is that guy? This is the catch-22: The Hawks may be damned to never win if they do keep Young and damned if they don't. Season opener : Oct. 22 vs. Toronto Complete schedule Trae Young is good. His supporting cast could be great. And what's the fun of rooting against a could-be contender? Take the over and hope Young is great, too. And he better be, because the team is built for it. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

In a sit-down with NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke for \"Dubs Talk,\" the Golden State guard reflected on why the 2024-25 NBA season was the happiest of his basketball life and how coach Steve Kerr’s leadership played a central role. In his exit interview last season, Hield summed up his first Warriors campaign by saying, “This is the most happy I’ve ever been playing basketball.” With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Asked why Golden State has been different, Hield pointed to the trust and freedom he was given. “They allow me to be myself,\" Hield told Burke. \"They allow me to be me. Previous teams I’ve been on, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy, but here it’s just a unique vibe than the rest of the teams. They allow me to express myself, and I was able to to play basketball with a lot of joy and not have to look over my shoulder.” Before arriving in the Bay Area, Hield played for the New Orleans Pelicans, the Sacramento Kings, the Indiana Pacers and the Philadelphia 76ers, carving out a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable 3-point shooters.

Beyond the numbers, Hield described how the environment around him made the biggest difference. \"Everything was authentic from the coaches and the players, and it’s one situation where I just feel at peace,\" Hield added. That peace, Hield explained, stemmed from Kerr's leadership style . \"A lot of people say that coaches are transparent,\" Hield noted. \"A lot of coaches are not transparent. I think Steve was just 100 percent honest, transparent from day one, and never once has Steve given me the wrong answer. He’s always been straight up with me, and that’s what I like.\" The 60-year-old coach has built his Warriors tenure on communication and trust, winning four NBA championships while managing a locker room full of stars. Kerr, a former guard who played 15 NBA seasons and won five championships with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs, took over Golden State in 2014. Since then, he’s guided the Warriors through one of the league’s most successful runs. For Hield, that straight-shooting approach stood out immediately. \"As a basketball player, you love to be happy like that and love to play with that joy, and I couldn’t ask for a better year than that.\" With Kerr’s honesty and the Warriors’ support behind him, Hield enters Year 2 in Golden State not just chasing wins, but carrying the peace of mind that changed his game.

It is beyond cool that 40-year-old LeBron James , one of the greatest players in history, is on the same roster as Luka Dončić , one of the most decorated young players the NBA has ever seen. It is impossible not to think of their Lakers as a great team, if only because in our minds the two of them are that good. Whether they make practical sense as a championship duo is another matter. James is currently suffering from sciatica on his right side , which will cost him the start of the season. This is not news that inspires much confidence in James' ability to hold up his end of that bargain between two max-salaried co-stars. Meanwhile, Dončić is a 26-year-old who appears to be in the best shape of his life . One makes sense to build around. The other? He will be, at some point soon — if not now — just hoping the bottom doesn't fall out on his career. As difficult as it may be, the Lakers have to consider whether it is wise to spend any more of Dončić's prime investing in the chance that James could still be who Dončić needs him to be. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Already, James is no longer the defensive stalwart he once was, not even close, and Dončić has never been known for his defense. Offensively, there is also a ton of overlap among their skill sets as ball-dominant superstars. There is reason for skepticism — reason to ask: Can they still maximize each other? They are, of course, also two of the greatest offensive minds the game has ever seen, and they will figure a lot of things out. They will win a lot of games, so long as James can get healthy, but can they win a title? The defense is a hindrance to that goal. Their third-best player, Austin Reaves, is no stopper. Nor is Deandre Ayton. The Lakers did sign one-time Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart, but at age 31 he has not displayed the same on-ball dynamism he once did. This is going to be a porous defensive team. They ranked 17th on that end last season and lost Dorian Finney-Smith, their best defensive player. Remember: Dončić and James took the floor together in the first round of last season's playoffs, losing in five games as favorites to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Los Angles did little to address its fatal flaw. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] The Dallas Mavericks built a team of two-way talents around Dončić and Kyrie Irving to reach the 2024 NBA Finals. The Lakers will eventually have do the same around Dončić in L.A., but they have not done that. Reaves and Ayton have a lot of potential between them, but little of it is on the defensive end. In Dončić's case, there is time to fix this. He is entering his prime and signed a three-year, $160.8 million contract extension. James does not have any of those luxuries. He will turn 41 years old in December, his contract expires at the end of this season, and we have no idea when Father Time will come for James. If, indeed, it becomes clear that this roster is not one with which Dončić can win a championship, what do the Lakers do? Do they try to reconfigure it around Dončić and James on the fly in the narrow window that they have together, dealing a 27-year-old Reaves and draft picks in search of two-way contributors? That has a real possibility of backfiring. Make moves in desperation, and the Lakers could easily find themselves in a post-LeBron era without any flexibility on the trade market, trying to field a competitive team around Dončić. Take a step back, and the plan becomes much clearer: Focus on Dončić — now. Build around him the way you would around a young James, and you know what a young James would do? Trade the 40-year-old aging superstar whose $52.6 million salary is a deterrent to building a title team around its best player. That, or let him walk in free agency at season's end, freeing up the kind of salary-cap space that could be committed to a more age-appropriate playing partner in Los Angeles. This is L.A., after all, and these are the Lakers. Someone will want to join Dončić on this ride. It is unclear if James even wants to be that guy, as his agent, Rich Paul, issued the following cryptic statement this past June: \"We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage of his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.\" What is best for James may not be what is best for Dončić, and the Lakers will soon have to choose sides. What that looks like in the short-term is anyone's guess, but one of their superstars is just beginning his L.A. story, while the other is scripting its end. Threading the needle between them may be a fool's errand."}

After going with a small-ball approach in the preseason opener while bringing Al Horford off the bench in his Golden State debut, Kerr made Horford a starter against the Trail Blazers along with Stephen Curry , Moses Moody , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . âThat could be a really powerful combo,â Kerr said. âI didnât have a great sense of it after the game because I was thinking so much of our turnovers and our lack of focus at times during the first half. But looking at the tape, it was a lot better than I expected for those first seven minutes or so.â Kerr likes having more size on the court to start the game, especially with Horford, who shoots well enough from three-point range to give everyone else plenty of room to operate. The group only played together for a little more than half of the first quarter before Kerr began making substitutions, and the veterans rested in the second half. âYou can tell with all the different lineups, we know that thereâs still going to be a lot to work on in terms of the chemistry and just the certain combinations,â Curry said. âThatâs part of the journey of training camp. But I just like the vibe and the intentionality that weâre all coming with, understanding that we need to get off to a good start. And trying to make that happen.â There’s more on the Warriors: Interesting. So yes, I think the starting lineup should be Curry Moody Butler Green Horford. Sounds like when things are right thatâs the best starting 5. Perhaps this has been suggested the last month or so? I donât know.., maybe? ari, easymoneyrider, peter contrope, nba is ok, davey j ..,? You gentlemen certainly have an opinion here? Moody canât start. He has no handle lol â¦.. Donât think heâd get much chances to handle anyways with Green facilitating a lot of the offence, Curry the go to guy and then Butler as your secondary scoring option and what third ball handler? It would be more of a catch and shoot role and be good defensively Kerr is the best coach in the league and will figure it out. Maybe Kuminga will play more if he actually gives it full effort.

Coach JJ Redick announced the plan on Saturday, but he didn’t specify when Doncic will be active and said it hasn’t been determined if he’ll suit up for Sunday’s matchup with Golden State. L.A. will also face Phoenix on Tuesday, Dallas on Wednesday and Sacramento on Friday. Doncic has been given a reduced workload in practice to allow him to recover from an intense summer representing Slovenia at EuroBasket. He was a full participant during Saturday’s session. “I had (the) national team,” Doncic said. “Playing one month or something of basketball (for Slovenia). Obviously it’s a long season ahead, so just because of that.” The Lakers dropped their first two preseason contests while using a modified lineup because Doncic and LeBron James were unavailable. There’s more from Los Angeles: James sitting out will be a great opportunity for Rui, Vando and LaRavia getting more minutes and more shots. Even Knecht might get some playing time with LeBron out. Hopefully, Bron comes back healthy in a month or two, and the Nove mentioned players will have built up some confidence, which will bode well for the Lakers in the playoffs. What team does better next season, GSW or Lakers? Both are old and seemingly on their last legs on being considered contenders but both donât exactly have strong enough rosters in comparison to some of the other teams in the league. Luka Bron Reaves with help from Smart Vando Rui Ayton or Curry Butler Green with help from Kuminga Heild Horford and what not They both finish with win totals in the high forties and their playoff fates will be hugely health reliant. If either one makes it out of the West it will be because they stayed healthy while other teams suffered key injuries. I wonât be shocked if Curry or LeBron add to their ring totals this yearâ¦and in that coin toss I will pick the Warriors I donât see either team having a chance at winning a chip unless there is a trade or two. Warriors could do that with Kuminga but until that happens then I donât rate their chances. As for the Lakers, I think they have many issues, mainly a lack of defence. Luka Reaves Bron and Ayton donât offer much and when you then have Smart and Vando in there for their defence they offer nothing on offence. They need more two way guys and better cohesion. Rui gets a lot of smack from people but he plays his role perfectly. Over 50% from the field and over 40% on 3, does well on defence and can play either forward spot. “Both are old and seemingly on their last legs of being considered contenders” GSW are old. LAL are not. Other than LeBron, they have only 2 players older than 30 – Smart and Kleber. In a potential Doncic, Reaves, Hachimura, Ayton, Vanderbilt line-up, the oldest player is 27. That line-up has the same average age as Strus, Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, Mobley, Garland team. Carmelo, Russ, Dwight, Rondo, Ariza, DeAndre Jordan are not in Los Angeles anymore. That team was old in 2022. 25-26 Lakers are not. Not a good sign to load manage Luka already. Maybe an injury prone player shouldn’t beat himself up just weeks before the NBA season.

A $10MM annual salary with a club option in 2026/27 made Ball extremely attractive to contenders, and the Cavaliers were the first to pounce, sending Isaac Okoro to Chicago in a July trade . Ball is happy to be with a contender in Cleveland, and he believes both teams benefitted from the deal. âI think teams trade to try to get better, so Chicago did what was best for them, and I think Cleveland did what they thought was best for them,â Ball said. âSo all I can control is where Iâm at and who Iâm playing for, and thatâs the Cavs right now. Go out there and give them my all.â Ball completed a remarkable comeback last season, appearing in 35 games after missing two and a half years due to recurring knee issues. Cowley expects the Cavs to be cautious with him — limiting his minutes and not using him on both nights of back-to-backs — in order to keep him healthy for the playoffs. Ball is still a beloved figure in Chicago, and he received a tribute video when Cleveland visited the United Center on Thursday. âJust thankful, man,â he said. âI made a lot of good relationships here on and off the court. Loved the city of Chicago, and, as you can see, the fans still rock with me, so a lot of love to them. But coaches, man, even my teammates, itâs always great seeing them and hope the best for them moving forward, for sure.â There’s more on the Bulls: 24 wins at best. I think you are waaaaay underestimating there…Tre Jones is underrated. Coby White and Vucevic are in contract years, and Giddey was really good down the stretch in important games. I’d start those 4 with Okoro, Dosunmu, and maybe eventually Buzelis, and that’s a good lineup. Lots of playmaking and shooting, albeit with a lack of rim protection, but I’d put them in the 42-45 win area because Donovan is also a great coach. Nice to see that Pat got his running practice in in the dunes. Since thatâs all he does on the court too. Just run back and forth and move the ball . TSnell 2.0 Imagine waiting for a positive impact from P-Will after wasting the first 5 YEARS of his careerâ¦and he was even given $90 mil to stay here! Another failure from the AKME era of the Bulls. Shouldâve gotten rid of him a couple years ago when we knew he wasnât worth the #4 pick. Williams is getting in shape to more quickly run to the bank to cash those huge checks before he’s run out of the league. Please login to leave a reply.

In a pre-game meeting with reporters, coach Jason Kidd said the team is taking a cautious approach with Exum’s recovery. He indicated that Exum will be out for an extended period, but didn’t speculate on how long it might be. This is the first time anyone from the team has provided specifics on the injury that has affected Exum since training camp began. Kidd added that the Mavs are taking a “long-term view” with Exum’s health and explained that the injury has “delayed his preparation for the start of the season,” tweets Grant Afseth of Dallas Hoops Journal. Injuries have been a career-long issue for Exum, who only appeared in 20 games last season due to right wrist surgery and a broken left hand. He was still an effective player when healthy, making 13 starts and averaging 8.7 points and 2.8 assists in 18.6 minutes per night. Exum reached an agreement in early July to re-sign with the team on a one-year, minimum-salary contract. The deal wasn’t finalized until September 1 because Dallas had to open a roster spot and clear up room under its second apron hard cap. That happened when the Mavs waived and stretched former first-round pick Olivier-Maxence Prosper in late August. Dallas had been hoping for better health from the 30-year-old combo guard, as Kyrie Irving is still recovering from a torn ACL and his return date remains uncertain. In addition,Â Brandon Williams is dealing with a hamstring strain he suffered early in training camp. If Exum’s absence appears to be prolonged, it could improve the chances for Dalano Banton ( Exhibit 10 contract ) or Dennis Smith Jr. ( Exhibit 9 deal ) to earn a roster spot. I’m glad Dallas has given Exum a chance, but it does not seem likely he is going to be able to sustain an NBA career. So on point. I love the comeback story, but seriously what is Dallas doing giving out guaranteed money to Exum, injury is certain to follow Please login to leave a reply.

Wright of ESPN . The No. 2 pick in this year’s draft sat out the first two games as a precaution after undergoing thumb surgery in September, and he enjoyed the chance to showcase his skills in a game setting. “Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,” Harper said. “My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they’re going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they’re here to help me out and I’m here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.” Harper checked into the game midway through the first quarter and picked up two quick assists on alley-oop passes to Victor Wembanyama and Luke Kornet , per Jeff McDonald of The San Antonio Express-News (subscription required). He only played 18 minutes due to a medical restriction, but he ran the offense while he was on the court and finished with a game-high plus-minus rating of +20. He also picked up full-court on defense and vowed that part of his game will get better as his conditioning improves. “It’s just another step for him and his young career as he’s going to continue to grow,” coach Mitch Johnson said. “Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he’ll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.” There’s more from the Southwest Division: Jones-Garcia can play. Unfortunately the Spurs have a lot of guys his size or taller with more experience, so unless they have some injuries he’ll be stuck in the G league.

Boucher, who spent the past seven years in Toronto before signing with Boston as a free agent in August, posted 19 points and nine rebounds in 23 minutes against his former team. He made his second straight start at power forward and may keep that role when the season begins. âHe cares about winning, he cares about people, he takes pride in his work ethic,â coach Joe Mazzulla said. âThereâs few guys who take no plays off whether itâs at shootaround, or a game, and that guy is one of them. Itâs impressive, 32 years old, to have the energy that he does on and off the court.â Boucher, who accepted a one-year, veteran’s minimum contract, has been a welcome addition for a team that had significant front court losses from last season. Robb sees him as a natural fit for the up-tempo approach that Mazzulla wants to bring to the offense, and he’s willing to shoot from beyond the arc whenever he gets an open look. Boucher is probably most effective in a double-big lineup, Robb adds, but he can handle some minutes at center if the Celtics want to go smaller. “I’m really excited,” Boucher told the Toronto media, including Josh Lewenberg of TSN Sports about his decision to sign with Boston ( Twitter link ). “I talked to them and had a great conversation about what my role could be and the opportunity I could get on this team. So, for me, it was an easy decision to make.” There’s more on the Celtics: Baylor Scheierman is still a learning process… Well he’s 25, hope he gets it sooner rather than later He’s a year younger than Xavier Tillman, which is wild cuz Tillman looks a tad like my grampy What mazzulla angry about?

One scout questioned whether Sarr will become a reliable enough outside shooter to qualify as a stretch big man, while another suggested the seven-footer will have to bulk up and become more imposing physically in order to maximize his potential as a rim protector. “He weighs less than some of the bigger wings and forwards that are starting in the NBA,” that scout said. Still, multiple sources who talked to Robbins are optimistic about Sarr’s ability to build on what he showed during his rookie season and to continue making strides toward becoming a reliable starting center. “I would be surprised if he doesnât take a big leap this year, and that big leap will be being effective on the floor and trying to impact the team outcome as opposed to impacting his individual outcome,” one evaluator told Robbins. “Thereâs still a lot (of untapped potential) as to what he could be. It was probably a slower start than maybe the general fan would hope for. But I think by the end of (last) season, he had been put in a position to succeed, and weâre going to see more of that built on this season. Weâre going to see it start to pay dividends this season.” Here’s more on Sarr and the Wizards: I was not happy with what I saw from Sarr in his rookie year. Not because he was bricking jumpers or because he didn’t have polished finishing moves around the rim, but because he displayed abysmal positioning in every stage of the play on both ends: in the paint when his team had the ball, under the basket, when sets didn’t go right etc. That’s why he mostly defaulted to dangling around the perimeter – he didn’t know where to put himself, so he floated outside. On defense, it was the same thing. Don’t let his occasional blocks fool you – he was a huge negative when the opponents had the ball, couldn’t defend the rim and let all sorts of things happen in his paint. It was amazing to see how little space he occupied and protected while being a 7-footer. The only thing he did well was switching onto perimeter players and doing a good job of containing them. I’ll give him that. This incompetence at positioning is a basketball crime to me, especially for someone who was born in a basketball family and attended Real Madrid’s academy. It’s the reason why he can’t grab rebounds at his height. I was in Katowice to watch him at Eurobasket, and it was even more evident in person, because you can concentrate on 1 player and what he does when you’re in the stands. I’ve given up on Alex Sarr. It’s sort of reverse psychology: if I don’t expect anything from him, so that he can’t disappoint me. If he develops into something, it’ll be a pleasant bonus. Can Vukcevic be a real 5, or is he a bench stretch 4? Probably the latter, but we’ll see. Washington’s plan to somehow draft Bailey after the brutal lottery didn’t work out. Utah took him. So, Tre Johnson it is. Well, at least the team didn’t pick Knueppel or Fears at 6. Hopefully, one of Tre Johnson or Whitmore can score, and the team won’t be down by 15-25 points in the 1st half like they so often were in 24-25. And the games will be closer. What will happen to CJ? Most likely, the same thing that happened to Brogdon: nobody will trade for him before the deadline (because his value is being better than a bad contract, and there aren’t that many bad contracts in the NBA anymore), he will spend the entire season with the Wiz, and will get a veteran minimum in the summer of 26. Jamir Watkins is whatever. This team will be tanking for way too long and will have way too many picks needing minutes for him to get an opportunity. Please login to leave a reply.

So, you can predict what kind of strategy we will use for this season. But we have a very young team.” Tsai isn’t saying anything that any Nets or NBA fan doesn’t already know. Brooklyn entered the summer as the only team with significant cap space, but used that room to take on unwanted contracts and continue stockpiling draft picks rather than acquiring win-now help. With five rookie first-round picks on their roster, the Nets will be prioritizing player development over their win-loss record in the coming months. Although Brooklyn’s approach to the season is no secret, the NBA typically frowns upon any public remarks from an executive or owner suggesting that his team might be in tanking mode. Tsai’s comment about being able to predict the “kind of strategy” the Nets will use to achieve their goal of getting a “good” draft pick can certainly be interpreted that way, so we’ll see if the league office responds at all, perhaps with a fine. After the Nets won 32 games in 2023/24 and 26 in ’24/25, oddsmakers have set their over/under for ’25/26 at just 20.5 wins. While general manager Sean Marks has insisted he was happy the team exceeded preseason expectations last season, his moves since last December – including trading away veterans Dennis SchrÃ¶der , Dorian Finney-Smith , and Cameron Johnson – suggest he wouldn’t mind if the Nets were to drop a few more games this year and land a pick higher than No. 8 in the 2026 draft lottery. In the process of reducing the number of veterans on the roster, Marks has loaded up youth, selecting Egor Demin (No. 8), Nolan Traore (No. 19), Drake Powell (No. 22), Ben Saraf (No. 26), and Danny Wolf (No. 27) in this June’s draft. Brooklyn projects to have the NBA’s youngest team in 2025/26, as Lewis notes. What an exquisite way to say they’re tanking. Hope he gets fined hard. Well, given he is worth billions even $5 million fine would mean nothing more than pocket change to him. 2026 draft is loaded So they don’t think MPJ can lead them to a play in 8th seed? He can’t do it alone, and he’s not on their future plans anyway. MPJ, Claxton, Thomas all when healthy can be a play in team. They are one of the youngest teams so will probably be bad like Wiz. They should be a fast pace team, but Claxton the only defense guy I think of on the team. He will be dumped at some point this season I don’t know $38-40 million is a lot for him. It is a good price for Nets I guess as their best player. It would be terrible on other teams like Nuggets when the guy is 3rd option. Openly admitting before the season has even started, that they are actively trying to lose, is a whole new level of arrogance. How is it arrogant when the team IS so young and likely to lose a lot of games anyway? I don’t know why people take issue with the person saying the obvious thing we all know will happen anyway. It makes zero difference. The league punishes it only because they don’t like the quiet part being said out loud, which is frankly a little silly since even casual fans know how much of a problem tanking has become. But until they further flatten out the lottery odds it will continue to happen. That’s on the league. BKN played too well last year, and it cost them in the draft. I guess the owner is sending a message to his FO and HC that he wants no part of that again. Sad, though, that tanking has gotten to the point that an owner feels totally comfortable being so open about it. It’s what happens, I guess, when a league doesn’t have a real commissioner. Teams certainly tanked under Stern, but not so shamelessly. Not only did they deny it, they took enough acts to back up those denials. It was a source of shame, and all assumed that if Stern had real evidence of a team not using its best efforts to win (required by the articles of association), that such team would be punished. Now, not only are teams out of the closet, but they boast about their efforts in doing it. They would never attach a pick to get rid of his contract… His contract has some value. His salary is really big, so only way they trade him is by taking on a worse contract (e.g. Paul George). Big chance fhey keep him, try to increase his value and trade him as an expiring contract next off season… Please login to leave a reply.

Despite the lengthy negotiations and a contract that could make him a prime trade candidate, Kuminga tells Marc J. Spears of Andscape he’s “at peace” with his situation and doesn’t feel any anxiety about the future. “ I donât think about things like that. I let the day just tell us whatâs going to happen ,” Kuminga said. “ But when it comes to future stuff and things like that, no. I donât worry about things like that. I just try to get better. You never know with this life. Itâs the NBA. One day youâre going to be here. One day youâre going to be somewhere else. “ The biggest thing about it is just to work and just get better every day and be a winner. No matter where Iâll be, no matter if Iâm going to be here or they might ship me somewhere else. I just want to get to wherever Iâll get, or be here and just be involved and win and impact right away. That is my biggest concern. Iâm at that point now where Iâve got a couple years in now. So, I know whatâs right and what is not right .” Kuminga acknowledged some frustration with the way his role has fluctuated during his time with Golden State and said he doesn’t plan to bring the topic up with head coach Steve Kerr . For his part, Kerr still believes Kuminga can be an important piece for the Warriors, according to Spears. “ Itâs been an interesting fit ,” Kerr told Andscape. “ Heâs made it pretty clear that he wants the ball and an opportunity that a lot of his cohorts get and people that were drafted near him. And we werenât able to offer that. We were a championship team. We won the title his rookie year (2021/22) and have been in the mix the last few years. So, itâs been tough. I respect the fact that he is competing and fighting in a set of circumstances that maybe isnât ideal for him. But the thing I keep telling him is he can play a role for us, absolutely, with his size, speed and athleticism. “ He can play an important role on a very good team. He just turned 23 (on Monday). He has plenty of basketball ahead. One day, hopefully, he will look back on this as a valuable time in his career. But I know heâs frustrated. Heâs made it very clear publicly. I donât mind that, but I want him to embrace the idea that he can be a part of something special .” Here’s more on the Warriors: Wow there aren’t 100 comments rehashing the same argument over and over yet. Teams like the Dubs are just boring. If the ancient Ford pickups with 250k miles on them keep running for most of the season, theyâll be a pretty good team. If not, theyâll be bad. So what. Moving on. Not sure what sort of basketball you like to watch but the Warriors’ style of play isn’t boring to me. I prefer the motion offense that they employ (and most teams have started to mimic/adopt portions of in their play). Nothing in basketball is better than Steph on a heater, and then he does some dumb funny s*** like the night night and it gets even better! Give it time, it won’t be long. There definitely werenât enough Dubs talking points this summer, justkidding. The usual cast of characters bantered and pondered more about Kuminga than the guy deserves. I was hoping he would get moved this summer. Dunleavy could REALLY wash his hands clean of the Meyers Era by packaging JK along with Moody and potentially even Draymond for a superstar/superstar-caliber player Steph desperately needs to seriously compete for chip #5. Iâm curious to see how the current group does – but since this roster is so damn deep now, it feels like a big trade at some point in the next 9 or so months is inevitable. Yeah ,,,,,, I wondered about that. Imo he will be traded as soon as they can. He doesnât fit this team now. Warriors need a proven guy. Not nurture a new talent.? They will move him. “I just want to get to wherever Iâll get” That pretty much says it all. I was very disappointed in Kuminga the last few days. His 2nd preseason game he was not focused at all and made some very poor mistakes. Then at the fan open practice he sat on the bench and didnât do anything. No shooting or fan interaction. Itâs almost like he wants to force a trade in Jan. I think itâs the worst kept secret that both sides are just waiting for a January trade Looks like Kuminga wants out as soon as possible maybe with kings out of the playoffs they can get Murray and some bench players for Kuminga. But certainly youâve read assessments here that heâs a future canât miss all nba bonafide pro who has been ruined by his coach and lack of opportunity? Donât drink the kool-aid from people hereâ¦ if someone can consistently put up 20 points a night and play defense with effort, every NBA coach will consistently find minutes for him instead of splitting time with Gui Santos and Gary Payton Jr. Maybe the veteran players on GSW arenât especially good at translating their knowledge for younger players to absorb. Certainly GSW hasnât developed their talent very well despite some very lucky breaks from the lottery. Probably some combination of all 3 of Kuminga, the veterans and the coach share the blame. Either way, if it walks like a duckâ¦ you know the rest. The Warriors didnât think he was worth much, the Kings thought he was worth Malik Monk and Devin Carter, and his own coach refuses to play him in the playoffs with minutes available and scoring desperately needed. At some point acknowledging the external and consistent ongoing indicators of Kumingaâs value will be accurately reflected in discussions here. But until then youâll have to hear people say heâs the backbone of a Giannis trade. Iâm sure the Kings offered the Bucks Malik Monk and Devin Carter for Giannis as well. Warriors couldnât make that trade because Monk makes more than Kuminga. Carter is not even loved by the kings. Nobody offered anything for Kuminga and he is not a 20 point a game player. @ARC 2 I think he’s definitely a 20 ppg player, as long as a team makes him a starter and plays him at least 32 min/gm. His career per 36 pts is 20.5, and that’s with Kerr jerking him around and benching him frequently. He proved that in the Wolves series in the playoffs, despite Kerr not starting him even once and playing him only an avg of 27.4 min/gm, he still avgd 20.8 ppg on 545/42%/74% splits. Itâs not so much th points but no IQ plays. He threw the ball away on 2 different possessions on a simple throw in that cost them 4 points. He needs to have his head in the game on every possession. Draymond has done the same thing multiple times. @Duuur Except obviously the Kings thought Kuminga was worth more than Monk and Carter, but GSW wasn’t desperate enough to trade Kuminga + another player to do the deal. “The Warriors didnât think he was worth much” They think he’s worth a good young player and a FRP, which is why they offered multiple overpays for him to choose from. He signed a tradable 1+1, so we will see what they get for him by the deadline. @ARC 2 “Itâs almost like he wants to force a trade in Jan.” Almost? Relax bro. Even if he leaves. You will get good value for him. Love to see him with Grizz or Bucks. Podz thinking of himself as a leader is interesting. you can’t play his position and not be a leader. He wants to stay with GS for as long as possible. Wants to be there post-Steph. Tries so hard to be a company man for them. Attends their women’s team games, always says the right things in interviews. He wants to make himself more valuable for GS than for any other team in the NBA. Sort of like Draymond. But Draymond is a much better player than Podziemski is or ever will be, of course. Why do you comment on things when you don’t know what they said. Heâs literally quoted in the article saying that. Reading is fundamental He didn’t say he is a leader. He said the next step in his development is to evolve emotionally as a player and leader.

The Magic selected four of those players in the first round of the past three drafts, with Bitadze being the lone exception. Here are a few more notes from around the Southeast Division: Carter and Bitadze are an impressive center duo. Bitadze’s defense is phenomenal. Good luck, Precious, however you’re dead to me like IHART. Magic should be very good this year. I feel people are low-key sleeping on Orlando and Atlanta. Both could be very dangerous.

Why the Warriors could be more dangerous than you think", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46545448/nba-season-2025-2026-golden-state-warriors-western-conference-champions-oklahoma-city-thunder", "published_at": "2025-10-13T07:20:01+00:00", "domain": "espn.com", "summary": "ESPN analyst Zach Kram details why Golden State's championship window might not be closed after all.", "body": "Stephen Curry tells ABC's Larry Beil that he isn't worried about the age of the Warriors' roster. (1:01) A decade after winning the first of four titles to start a dynasty, the Golden State Warriors have seemingly been passed by the rest of the Western Conference. According to ESPN BET , the Warriors have just the seventh-best odds to win the West this season, behind the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder , Denver Nuggets , Houston Rockets , Los Angeles Lakers , Minnesota Timberwolves and LA Clippers . That placement makes some sense. Golden State was the No. 7 seed last season, bowed out in five games in the second round and could boast the oldest starting lineup in NBA history this season. If Buddy Hield joins Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler III , Draymond Green and Al Horford in the starting lineup after Hield's birthday on Dec. 17, the Warriors would be the first team to start five players 33 or older in a game, according to ESPN Research. But that quick, pessimistic summary severely underrates Golden State's potential. In contrast, the Warriors profile as one of the most dangerous teams in the West, even in their dotage, and they might even be able to compete with the omnipotent Thunder. The NBA's last repeat champion could be a sleeper that stops the newest candidate from repeating. Projections from ESPN's Kevin Pelton place the Warriors second in the entire NBA, with a forecast of 56 wins -- closer to the top of the West than to the play-in portion of the standings. What explains the discrepancy between that projection and the general perception that the Warriors' window has closed? Here's the simple explanation: In half a season with Butler, the Warriors were one of the best teams in the league, and they improved in the offseason. By that logic, they should be a contender again this season. Golden State upset the second-seeded Rockets in the first round and took Game 1 against the Timberwolves before running out of steam without Curry, who suffered a hamstring strain 13 minutes into the series. There's no shame in losing that way, as any contender would expect to struggle without its best player. Don't let the 2024-25 Warriors' meek playoff exit mask their remarkable in-season turnaround, though. Before the Butler trade, Golden State was 25-26 with a minus-0.4 net rating. But from Butler's debut through the end of the regular season, it ranked first in defensive rating and third in net, at plus-9.2 per 100 possessions. The team's 23-8 record in that span -- which extrapolates to 61 wins over a full season -- wasn't a fluke. With Curry back and Butler on board for a full season, there's no reason to think Golden State will be any worse this season. The Warriors should benefit from incredible continuity. Twelve of their top 13 players in 2024-25 postseason minutes will return in 2025-26, and they upgraded on the one departure ( Kevon Looney ) with Horford, who left the Boston Celtics in free agency. Horford's arrival in Golden State is crucial , as Curry has never played with a big man like the 39-year-old NBA champion before. Among Warriors centers since Curry's breakout season (2012-13), the leaders in total 3-point makes are Dario Saric , who made 74 3s as a backup center in 2023-24, and Quinten Post , who sank 73 as a rookie last season. By comparison, Horford has made triple-digit 3s in each of the past three seasons, and his 40.9% 3-point mark over that span is the best among all centers with at least 100 makes, narrowly ahead of Karl-Anthony Towns' 40.8%. His ability to stretch the floor will provide important balance next to Butler and Green, who can both be reluctant shooters. Horford is also a far superior defender and creator to Saric and Post, making him a better all-around fit for the Warriors' lineup. There is tremendous defensive potential in a frontcourt featuring Butler, Green and Horford, who have a combined 15 All-Defensive Team appearances in their careers. A strong defense, after all, is just as central to the Warriors' winning identity as Curry's deep 3s. In 2021-22, their last title season, the Warriors finished second in defensive rating versus just 16th on offense. And last year, Golden State led the league in defensive rating after Butler's arrival -- even without Horford, and even with their opponents making an unsustainably high percentage of their 3-point tries. Golden State should also be better on the other end this season. In 2024-25, the offense hummed as long as Curry was on the floor but fell apart when he rested; lineups without Curry or Butler placed in just the 5th percentile in offensive rating, per Cleaning the Glass. Butler stabilized those groups, though, and the Warriors ended up looking solid as long as one of those stars was on the floor. Age and availability could get in the way of that plan. Curry has missed an average of 15 games per season since sitting out nearly all of 2019-20, while Butler hasn't reached the 65-game threshold for NBA awards since 2018-19. The Warriors will likely struggle once again when Curry goes to the bench in games that Butler misses. Jonathan Kuminga , who is still a Warrior for now after a protracted restricted free agency , could play an important role as the best scoring option in no-Curry, no-Butler minutes; he averaged 24.3 points on 55% shooting in the Warriors' final four playoff games last season. Or Kuminga could improve the team by helping to facilitate a midseason trade. Kuminga is the only Warriors player with a cap hit between $12 million and $25 million this season, meaning he'd provide the necessary matching salary to get Golden State another sizable deal at the deadline. For now, though, it's unclear at what position the Warriors would need to improve. As the season approaches, they're operating with an enviable combination of star power and depth. Five different Warriors -- Curry, Butler, Green, Horford and Brandin Podziemski -- rank among the top 10% most impactful players in the league on a per-possession basis, according to the advanced stat xRAPM, which blends play-by-play and on/off data. The only other teams with more than three such players are the Thunder, Rockets and Cleveland Cavaliers . And behind that quintet, the Warriors have a mishmash of role players on the perimeter -- Hield, Kuminga, Gary Payton II , Moses Moody , De'Anthony Melton -- with various strengths, plus Post and Trayce Jackson-Davis to offer different looks as bigs off the bench. As Pelton notes about his projections, the Warriors \"have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team.\" Ultimately, the Warriors' greatest problem might not be anything about their roster specifically, but rather the context around them: The top of the West is much better than it was in 2022, when Golden State beat the injury-ravaged Nuggets, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks en route to the Finals. But even with that change, there are still major concerns for every team in the conference behind Oklahoma City and Denver. Fred VanVleet 's ACL tear should lower Houston's ceiling, perhaps by a considerable amount. Minnesota is relying on a number of rapidly aging veterans (38-year-old Mike Conley and 33-year-old Rudy Gobert ) and unproven youngsters ( Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr .) to support Anthony Edwards . The Lakers have a thin rotation and a potentially disastrous defense, and they're already dealing with a LeBron James injury. The Clippers face the same age questions as the Warriors, plus the possible ramifications of the Kawhi Leonard /Aspiration investigation . Even the Thunder, who don't even have any minor concerns, let alone major ones, could struggle to dispatch Golden State in a potential playoff matchup. The Warriors have consistently played this version of the Thunder tough. Over the last two seasons, Golden State is 3-4 against Oklahoma City; two of those losses came in overtime, and Curry didn't play in the other two. Butler wasn't on the roster for any of those contests. The Warriors wouldn't ever be favored to knock off the Thunder, of course, and they would need to navigate a minefield -- one of talented competition and their own age hurdles -- to get the chance. But it's not an entirely unrealistic proposition, and at this stage in their competitive timeline, a chance is all the Warriors can ask for. With James Wiseman gone and Kuminga halfway out the door, the Warriors' \"two timelines\" plan has been scuttled. It's all about the present timeline now, and maximizing Curry's remaining opportunities to add to his trophy case."}

Murray will undergo surgery and be reevaluated in four to six weeks, ruling the Kings' young power forward out for at least the first 10 games of the regular season. The injury comes at a pivotal time in Murray's career. Entering his fourth season, he is eligible for a contract extension in the next week. The deadline to come to an agreement with the Kings is Oct. 20. If they can't, Murray will enter restricted free agency next summer. Murray has been a pillar of durability early in his NBA career, appearing in 233 of a possible 246 games his first three seasons, starting all but two of them. This UCL tear is the most significant injury he has suffered as a pro. Murray was the projected starting power forward for a Kings team attempting to compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. He has made 543 career 3s and developed into a versatile defender on the wing, meaning the Kings will be without a crucial floor spacer and their most trusted stopper in the opening month.

Dennis Schroder , Zach LaVine , DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis are the four other expected starters."}

(0:58) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- While LeBron James is expected to be sidelined to begin the season as he recovers from sciatica on the right side of his body, the Los Angeles Lakers ' other superstar, Luka Doncic , said he doesn't feel compelled to do more in James' absence. \"I don't view it that way,\" Doncic said after practice Saturday. \"I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.\" So far without James and Doncic, the Lakers are winless in the preseason, going 0-2 against Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors . L.A. hosts Golden State in a preseason rematch Sunday, and Lakers coach JJ Redick said it is still being determined if Doncic will play. Sunday starts a stretch of three preseason games in four days for the Lakers, continuing with a road game against Phoenix on Tuesday and the second night of a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Redick said Doncic would play in two of L.A.'s remaining four preseason games. Doncic was a full participant on Saturday after having his workload modified all week to save the 26-year-old guard some wear and tear after he played for Slovenia in EuroBasket this summer. \"I had [the] national team,\" Doncic explained. \"Playing one month or something of basketball [for Slovenia]. Obviously it's a long season ahead, so just because of that.\" Now Redick has his work cut out for him trying to fill in for James while he is sidelined for the next three to four weeks before his sciatica is scheduled to be reevaluated. \"You hope that he's back soon,\" Redick said. \"Those things can be tricky. ... It is unclear what the starting lineup is going to be, that's the reality, until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.\" Doncic, guard Austin Reaves and center Deandre Ayton will occupy three of the five spots. It's the other two starting spots that Redick will examine, with Rui Hachimura starting 57 of the 59 games he played for L.A. last season under obvious consideration. Jarred Vanderbilt , who has started both preseason games so far and is the healthiest he has been since the Lakers' 2023 trip to the Western Conference finals and free agent signees Jake LaRavia and Marcus Smart give the team different options offensively and defensively. Smart, who has also been sidelined to start the preseason because of Achilles tendinopathy, will play against the Warriors, according to Redick. Redick said he has thought about having one lineup and rotation that fits best together when James plays and a separate one for when he doesn't. Doncic said he and James have \"talked a lot\" while observing the Lakers practice from the sidelines during training camp, which has helped with chemistry. For the time being, all Doncic and the Lakers will be getting out of James during games is what the 40-year-old can provide with his voice from the bench. \"It's a big change,\" Doncic said of having to play without James. \"He's a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be 'next man up.' We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be 'next man up.' That's it.\""}

The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks filed the lawsuit in August 2023, seeking more than $10 million in damages . The team alleged that the Raptors poached Ikechukwu Azotam, who worked for New York from 2020 to 2023, and ordered him to provide a trove of internal information after Toronto began recruiting him in the summer of 2023. The Knicks argued that this effort was geared toward giving the Raptors a competitive advantage. The Knicks specifically alleged that Azotam -- who worked for the team as an assistant video coordinator, then as a director of video/analytics/player development assistant -- sent the Raptors thousands of confidential files, including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research.

The Raptors, Azotam, Toronto coach Darko Rajaković, player development coach Noah Lewis and 10 \"unknown\" employees were listed as defendants in the lawsuit. In an October 2023 court filing, the Raptors called the Knicks' allegations \"baseless\" and a \"public relations stunt.\" The Raptors argued that the \"alleged 'theft of data' involved little more than publicly available information compiled through public sources readily accessible to all NBA Members.\" The Raptors repeatedly called for NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in and settle the dispute, and a judge in the U.S. Southern District Court in Lower Manhattan agreed . The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, meaning it is dismissed permanently."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might have made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4-of-5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. He played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he would feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter by running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up, and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Of the 42 players listed on the Lakers' and Phoenix Suns' training camp rosters, 22 were born in the 2000s and 19 were born in the 1990s. And one, James, was born in 1984 -- five months before Suns head coach Jordan Ott. The 40-year-old James didn't play in the exhibition game after being limited to light shooting through the first three days of training camp because of nerve irritation in his glute, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. The cushion, though, worked a full night, as his seat in the locker room and during the game at the end of the bench. When James eventually emerged in the locker room, wearing a T-shirt with the \"Forever King\" tagline from his latest Nike ad campaign printed on the front, he was asked by a reporter if he was ready to begin an unprecedented 23rd season. Before James could answer, Lakers guard Austin Reaves chimed in. \"You got another five seasons in you,\" he said. James' eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face. \"Why not six or seven, get to 30?\" the reporter continued. \"Yeah, set a record!\" Reaves added. James turned toward Reaves and smirked: \"I already set a record.\" Indeed, there have been approximately 5,000 players to suit up in the NBA, and James is the only one to stick around for 23 seasons. He has also scored more regular-season points than anyone else in league history (42,184), scored more postseason points (8,289), made more All-Star games (21) and was a part of the first active father-son duo to share the court as players together when he and Bronny James checked in against the Minnesota Timberwolves on opening night last fall.

Wright Wemby, Luka, Ant? Examining the players primed to become the face of the NBA Zach Kram 2 Related The accomplishments -- including the four MVPs, four championships and four Finals MVPs -- are well-documented. But if L.A. represents the fourth quarter of James' career after the first three were spent in Cleveland, Miami and Cleveland once more, the question now is whether the clock is truly running out -- or if he will push this thing to overtime. As James embarks on his eighth season with the Lakers -- the longest consecutive stint he's had with any of the franchises he's played for -- he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time after he exercised his $52.6 million option for the 2025-26 season in June without negotiating for an extension. During the Lakers' annual media day last week, the first question James fielded was about retirement. \"I don't know,\" said James, who earned second-team All-NBA honors in his 22nd season. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to play the game that I love for another season. And however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested. Because, like you said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later.\" The Lakers, who will be without James for the next three to four weeks as he deals with sciatica in his right side, are coming off a season in which they traded for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic and secured the No. 3 seed in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. But they fell to the No. 6-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. After James opted into his contract to stay in L.A., his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, issued a statement to ESPN's Shams Charania that many interpreted as an indication that James could finish his career somewhere else. \"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. ... We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.\" And after having full control over his career for his first 22 years, what's best and what's realistic could prove to be at odds. Here are the four possible ways this unprecedented season could go for James and the Lakers. LeBron James is excited about his Lakers squad this season and isn't sweating being in a contract year. James' time with the Lakers has seen him battle a rash of injuries that caused him to miss 124 games in seven seasons after he had missed only 71 in his first 15 years in the league. The Lakers' brass has cycled through four head coaches and the front office has had a mixed record on its trades and signings. Still, there has been plenty of success. The Lakers won a championship in 2020, with James becoming the first player in history to take home Finals MVP for three different teams. The franchise celebrated James in grand fashion when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer in 2023. And in 2024, the Lakers used the No. 55 pick to draft Bronny, allowing James to achieve what he had stated as his last remaining priority when he told ESPN, \"I need to be on the floor with my boy.\" A few months before the 2024 draft, the Golden State Warriors inquired about trading for James. The Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested. After the trade talks had passed, James expressed his commitment to the franchise. \"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and [have] been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said. Lakers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka, speaking at his annual season-opening news conference a few days before media day, made it clear where the franchise stands. \"We would love if LeBron's story would be, he retired a Laker,\" Pelinka said. \"That would be a positive story.\" While several sources close to James have told ESPN that it is unknown how the end of his career will play out, it could help James' desire to play on the best Lakers' team possible this season if it appears he has more basketball in him.

The Lakers can trade either their 2031 or 2032 first-round pick this season and have the right to swap firsts in five seasons in any deals they pursue this season, but they could be reticent to use those assets to invest in a team built for Doncic and James, if James is on the way out. For those looking for clues, there are a few out there. The Nike \"Forever King\" ad features a narrator speaking about James' career in the past tense -- \"They called him the Chosen One ... We were all witnesses.\" The Cleveland Cavaliers' \"Classic Edition\" uniform for this season is the same style James wore when he came into the league as a rookie with the Cavs in 2003-04. The NBA schedule makers had L.A.'s first home game of the season and last road game of the season both be against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, a fitting way for the two most important players of their era to have a proper send-off, if James is indeed on his last lap. And after media day, on his Instagram account, James posted a compilation of moments from the day with Lenny Kravitz's \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" playing underneath, possibly hinting at the end. Pelinka's answer at the news conference about James retiring with the Lakers was telling because he answered a different question than he was asked. He was asked if the Lakers would be interested in re-signing James in the summer of 2026. L.A. is projected to have approximately $50 million in cap space, which would all be swallowed up by James if he was to seek a new max contract. James will be eligible to sign up to a three-year deal for $188 million, with a starting salary of $58.1 million for 2026-27, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks. As great as James has been, extending his prime well beyond any reasonable actuarial table, there is a natural question as to how his timeline syncs up with the team's two other best players, both of whom are in their mid 20s. Doncic and Reaves, for their part, love playing with James and want the partnership to continue, sources told ESPN. Both players have not inquired with James about when he plans to retire, sources said, wanting to show respect for James' process. Doncic, who idolized James growing up, has enjoyed their partnership and believes James is vital to L.A.'s ability to win now, sources said. He is also undaunted by any spectacle or circus that could come with pairing up with James as he closes out his career because Doncic already experienced an aging legend on his farewell tour when Dirk Nowitzki's last season with the Dallas Mavericks coincided with Doncic's rookie year. Doncic found the time with Nowitzki to be invaluable, sources said. Plus, if the Lakers happen to win the championship this season -- bringing James' career total to five -- would he see that as a perfect ending, or would he want to come back to try to defend it and tie Michael Jordan with six? Tim Bontemps remains unsure on whether LeBron James will continue to play for the Lakers beyond next season. Paul's statement to ESPN in June established James' final priority as the curtain falls on his career: to win. That means, if L.A. is struggling -- whether because of injuries, poor roster fits, or simply because the team isn't good enough to thrive in the crowded West -- James could opt to leave. Since James holds a no-trade clause in his contract, any deal would need a greenlight from James to be executed. The problem is, there are not many viable destinations for him.

Because of their apron limitations, the Cavs would also be prevented from signing James off the waiver wire if he reached a buyout with L.A. The Warriors and New York Knicks would also be ineligible to sign James in that scenario. Then there's the Mavericks. James has won titles with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving , and has close relationships with coach Jason Kidd and several members of Kidd's staff. But the Mavs, too, would need to send out an exorbitant amount of money to make a deal work, according to Marks. Dallas is also currently a second-apron team, and would need to trade $12 million in salary without taking any back in order to become a buyout destination for James. There are 10 teams projected to have significant cap space in the summer of 2026, including the Brooklyn Nets , LA Clippers and Chicago Bulls , and there could be options for James that are currently unforeseen. However, it would be a major life change to leave Southern California when Savannah (his wife) and Zhuri (his daughter) live there, Bronny is under contract with the Lakers, and Bryce (his son) is a short flight away at the University of Arizona. And James will be in a free agent pool that potentially includes other stars such as Kevin Durant , Trae Young and James Harden -- plus impact players such as Reaves, Draymond Green , Bradley Beal , Norman Powell and Coby White -- so it's not a given he would receive endless interest around the league. And so James' situation remains undecided, and it's yet to be determined whether his 23rd season will be a countdown toward the end of his career or merely the bridge to a 24th, or beyond. Or whether his body will make the decision for him. \"Everyone is trying to dictate when he's done and the reality is nobody actually knows,\" a source close to James told ESPN. James, for his part, says he isn't concerned with the future for now. \"Not worried about yesterday and not trying to focus on what the future holds,\" he told ESPN. \"It's about staying present. ... Because like I said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it is not as long [away as] 'The Godfather 2.' So I know I got to stay present.\""}

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: Is there any hope for Joel Embiid and the Sixers?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-is-there-any-hope-for-joel-embiid-and-the-sixers/", "published_at": "2025-10-11T15:43:33+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Philadelphia 76ers, who are on the two-timeline plan", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Jared McCain's rookie season ended in mid-December of last year, but he still managed to play more minutes (592) than Joel Embiid did (574) for the 2024-25 Philadelphia 76ers . The same is true of reserves Jeff Dowtin Jr. (621), who was on a two-way contract and also played 17 games for the Sixers' G League team; Kyle Lowry (659), who barely played for the final three months; and Jared Butler (682), who joined the team at the trade deadline. In all, 15 players logged more minutes than Embiid did for last season's Sixers. The guy who played the fifth-most minutes, Ricky Council IV , is not currently on an NBA roster. (The Brooklyn Nets were reportedly going to bring him to camp if not for an injury.) Paul George missed half the games, too, and, by the end of the regular season, they were in full tank mode, trying to hang on to their top-six-protected pick. For a franchise that had invested about $400 million in Embiid and George the previous summer, it was an absolute nightmare. Good news, though: 2024-25 is over. The late tank worked, and, if you're a Sixers fan who hasn't already purchased a V.J. Edgecombe jersey, you've likely at least considered it. McCain will miss the start of the season because of a thumb injury, and neither George nor Embiid has played in the preseason, but, in theory, Philly will soon get a proper look at the team it has put together. The hope is that the ceiling is just as high as the Sixers envisioned when they're at full health and that the floor is nowhere near as low as it was last season. Last year: Just about everything that could do wrong did go wrong until the night of the lottery. The miserable, 24-win season did have some silver linings, though: Tyrese Maxey improved his point-of-attack defense, McCain looked like the Rookie of the Year during the brief period in which he was healthy and Quentin Grimes , acquired for Caleb Martin at the deadline, played like the guy the Knicks didn't want to trade for Donovan Mitchell four years ago . Guerschon Yabusele becoming a fan favorite and Justin Edwards emerging late in the season were small victories, too. The offseason: They grabbed Edgecombe with the No. 3 pick, used the No. 35 pick on stretch big Johni Broome and re-signed Edwards for three years and $7.1 million with a team option. They also re-signed Eric Gordon and Lowry and signed Trendon Watford away from Brooklyn, all on minimum contracts. Yabusele left for the Knicks , and they used two of their two-way slots on Jabari Walker and Dominick Barlow, who might have a chance to take some of his minutes. After a long standoff, Grimes signed the one-year qualifying offer. Las Vegas over/under: 42.5 wins, per BetMGM Sixers believer: Nothing about last season was fun in Philadelphia, but, with the exception of winning a championship, it was the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. By bottoming out, the Sixers were able to draft V.J. Edgecombe, who is probably a future star and definitely going to help them immediately. Daryl Morey's front office also learned from all the things that went wrong in 2024-25, as they've put together a significantly younger, more athletic roster than they had a year ago. Everyone except Tom Ziller seems afraid to say it, but the 2025-26 Sixers can be contenders if they are relatively healthy this time around. I know you're about to hit me with the same tired, boring \"Joel Embiid can't be relied upon anymore\" take that I've heard a million times, but once he's back on the court and looking like himself again, you'll change your tune. Sixers skeptic: The reason you've heard so many people say Embiid can't be relied upon anymore is not that there's some sort of anti-Philadelphia conspiracy going around. It's just the truth, no matter how much you and I wish it were not. The Sixers drafted Embiid 11 years ago, and the only time he has ever finished a season healthy was 2019-20 in the bubble. Embiid himself has acknowledged that playing through his knee injury -- and Bell's palsy -- in the 2024 playoffs was not the wisest decision. What scares me the most about Embiid is not that he barely played basketball last season, but the way he moved when he did play. At this point, I don't understand how anyone could be confident that he'll get back to an MVP level, let alone sustain it. Sixers believer: I'm assuming you agree with this statement about Embiid: \"Everyone has to consider the possibility that no surgery and rehabilitation, no matter how cautious and thorough, will ever be enough to keep him on the court for long.\" Sixers skeptic: Yeah, obviously. Sixers believer: Great. It's from a Philadelphia Inquirer article that is more than 10 years old . Before you write off Embiid, please remember that, before he had played a single second in the NBA, plenty of people were doing the same thing. His injury history has always been a cause for concern, but he has already overcome it to be named an All-Star seven years in a row and win an MVP award. Please don't act shocked if and when he makes this sentiment seem foolish again. Sixers skeptic: Can we talk about the rest of the team? There are only so many ways to say that Embiid is a massive question mark, and pointing out that the organization has been walking this tightrope for more than a decade definitely doesn't make me feel any better about it. Weren't you a little spooked when, with Embiid and Tyrese Maxey out of the lineup, Paul George scored a measly two points on 1-for-7 shooting in 36 minutes in Brooklyn in February? How do you feel about George having arthroscopic knee surgery in the summer and Jared McCain vlogging about another injury ? I get the Edgecombe excitement, but aren't you a little disappointed that the Sixers didn't keep Guerschon Yabusele or re-sign Quentin Grimes on a long-term contract? It's hard for me to flush last season when this season's vibes are already weird. Sixers believer: Actually, I have some questions for you about the San Antonio Spurs : Weren't you spooked by how inefficient De'Aaron Fox was in the 17 games he played for them last season? How do you feel about him missing all of preseason -- and probably some real games -- because of a hamstring injury? It's not a great sign that Stephon Castle is already dealing with a bruised knee, is it? Are you sure that Victor Wembanyama is going to stay healthy after missing almost half of last season? To be clear, I'm not seriously saying that everybody should be freaking out about the Spurs, but it's annoying that McCain had thumb surgery just three weeks after No. 2 pick Dylan Harper did and only the former is treated like a bad omen. Let's respect the Sixers' history of genuinely insane stuff happening by not overreacting to minor snags! And by the way, San Antonio's crowded backcourt and collective lack of shooting are bigger problems than any non-health-related issue with Philly's roster, and the Sixers have the benefit of playing in the East. George is 35, but the fact that he remained an elite defender last season indicates that his decline has been greatly exaggerated (as has the importance of that one game in which he was dealing with three separate injuries). McCain won't miss many games that matter. Grimes can still re-sign next summer, and, as much as I'll miss Yabu, I expect Trendon Watford to more or less make up for his absence. Sixers skeptic: If every single Spurs player except Wemby tears his Achilles next week, I'd still feel better about their future than Philadelphia's. There's no double standard here; one of these teams has the brightest future imaginable and the other one will be paying Embiid and George about $120 million combined in 2027-28. What sucks the most about the position the Sixers are in is that, if you ignore those two signings, they've made some amazing moves over the last few years! They got Maxey with the No. 21 pick, McCain with the No. 16 pick and Edgecombe with a pick they weren't really supposed to have. The Grimes trade was highway robbery, the Kelly Oubre Jr . signing (and re-signing) worked out as well as they could have hoped and Justin Edwards looks like a nice find. Adem Bona might be, too, and, after Yabusele (another smart signing) walked, it made sense to pick up Watford. Unfortunately, though, there's no mechanism for a clean transition to the post-Embiid era, so the Sixers are stuck doing the two-timelines thing. This has already cost them. While it's understandable that they wanted to stay under the first apron and maintain their ability to get under the tax with a trade, these constraints prevented them from paying Yabusele and Grimes what they're worth. Compromising in that way was a tell: No matter what Morey says, the organization isn't really all-in on this group anymore. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The question caused Lakers coach JJ Redick to say he was “not being combative\" with his answer. Asked if the Lakers are missing opportunities to practice more and build on-court chemistry because of their busy six-game preseason slate, Redick was quick to wonder why reporters were so concerned about the situation. “You guys are really harping on this,” Redick responded. So, Redick was asked, is it a thing or is it not a thing? “I’m not being combative right now,” Redick said. “I just want to acknowledge that you guys, like the last four days, like it’s becoming a little bit obsessive with all these questions about opportunities lost. So, I will answer it again. These are the cards that we were dealt. I sure would like everybody to be healthy.” Making the most out of the situation, the Lakers held off the Golden State Warriors 126-116 Sunday night at Crypto.com Arena despite not playing with LeBron James (sciatica), Luka Doncic and Marcus Smart (Achilles tendinopathy). Redick said the plan is for Smart to “get two games [in] this week.” Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue The Lakers have three remaining preseason games: Tuesday at Phoenix, Wednesday at Las Vegas against the Dallas Mavericks and Friday against the visiting Sacramento Kings — four games over a six-day span. Redick was reminded that the Lakers as an organization have chosen to play six preseason games — the maximum allowed by the NBA. “It’s something to be discussed I think going forward,” Redick said. “I think it’s awesome. I really do because we got to play in Palm Springs and I think it’s awesome that we get to play in Vegas and I recognize that there’s Lakers fans all over the world that maybe don’t get the chance to see us play. \"You hope that we can find some sort of balance in the future to get more practice time, less travel time. I’m sure at some point we’ll be one of the teams going overseas, so then that adds another scenario.\" Redick did say for training camp purposes, practice tends to be more helpful in team building than preseason games. “I think more practices would be beneficial,\" Redick said. “I do think the exposure to a game situation and playing against an opponent is very beneficial. You don’t have a lot of days anymore and to try to cram six games in there [and] four games in six nights, it’s significantly difficult.” Against the Warriors on Sunday, Austin Reaves (21 points), Dalton Knecht (16), Rui Hachimura (16) and Deandre Ayton (14 points, eight rebounds, five assists) were on top of their games. For Ayton, who was six for eight from the field and had a blocked shot, his joy came from the fans cheering him on. Sure, it was only a preseason game, but Ayton loved the vibe and the positive energy he felt. It was Ayton’s first time playing at Crypto.com Arena since he signed a two-year, $16.6-million deal with the Lakers. “It hit me in the whole arena today just hearing the fans and everybody cheering,” Ayton said. “It was kind of an unusual sound other than boos. ... It was everybody showing love and welcoming me to L.A. I played so freely and I had a lot of fun.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

The Sacramento Kings will be without forward Keegan Murray to start the season. Murray suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb during the team’s preseason loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night, the team announced on Sunday afternoon. Murray is set to undergo surgery in the near future, and he’ll be evaluated again in four-to-six weeks. [ Get more Kings news: Sacramento team feed ] If Murray is out the full six weeks, he could be eligible to return for the Kings' matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 24, the team’s 18th game of the season. Murray averaged 12.4 points and 6.7 rebounds last season, his third in the league after the Kings took him with the No. 4 overall pick in 2022. He’s missed just 13 games throughout his career due to injury. The former Iowa standout is entering the final year of his initial four-year, $36.3 million deal with the franchise, and he’s eligible for an extension this month. If Murray and the Kings can’t get a deal done, he’ll enter restricted free agency next summer. The 25-year-old has been a reliable piece in the Kings’ starting lineup over the past three seasons, and he’ll presumably play a big role in the team’s effort to make it back to the postseason — something they’ve only done once in the past two decades. The Kings went 40-42 last season and ended up firing head coach Mike Brown. The team eventually promoted interim head coach Doug Christie to replace him permanently. The Kings will open the regular season on Oct. 22 against the Phoenix Suns. It’s unclear who will take Murray’s place in the starting lineup in the meantime, though Christie experimented with rookie Maxime Raynaud at the position on Sunday, according to the Sacramento Bee . The Kings took Raynaud with the No. 42 overall pick in the draft earlier this summer out of Stanford, where he averaged 20.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. “In our league, two bigs, we’re starting to see quite a bit, so it’s one of the things I think that you’ve got to look at,” Christie said. “Max is a talented player. This is the preseason, so to get him out there and to get him those types of reps is more what that’s about. We’ve got a couple other options over the next couple days that we’ll throw out there.”"}

Vying for a starting position in the backcourt, Brandin Podziemski took advantage of being a focal point of the Warriors’ offense. Podziemski had nine points through the first half and then caught fire in the third, scoring 14. The Warriors then only trailed by five points going into the fourth quarter because of Podziemski's efforts. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Podziemski’s night was done, leaving the comeback attempt to the rest of his teammates. But Sunday night in LA belonged to Podziemski, showing how he can be a reliable scorer and playmaker, especially when the Warriors aren’t at full strength. Podziemski in 26 minutes scored 23 points on 10-of-16 shooting and also had five rebounds and eight assists. He was a plus-6.

Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Down their top two players, adding Horford and Moody to the list of Warriors absences called for an interesting starting five. Coach Steve Kerr started with Podziemski, Buddy Hield, Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green and Quinten Post. Moody is out the rest of the preseason and will be re-evaluated in a week with what the Warriors are calling a strained calf. “We’re not too concerned about it. It’s just we’re being careful,” Kerr told reporters in LA. The age of the Warriors’ top players already guarantees Kerr will have to be comfortable with multiple combinations and consistently tinker with who his starters are. This was the perfect opportunity for several young Warriors and role players to step up. The score was tied 13-13 when Kerr made his first substitution, bringing Gary Payton II in for Post. Golden State’s starting five began the second half together, and came out strong trying to cut down a 17-point deficit. The Lakers’ lead was cut to 10 points with the Warriors outscoring the Lakers 21-14 through the first five and a half minutes of the third quarter when Kerr brought Payton in for Post. Offense will have to run through Kuminga on nights that Curry and Butler are out. There were moments where he showed he can step up with more responsibility, and others where consistency continues to be a problem. Kuminga in the first quarter twice took advantage of Dalton Knecht switching onto him in the post. He also had three assists in the first quarter. Then in the second, Kuminga went from getting his ankles crossed on defense to throwing down an explosive dunk that only he can slam left-handed with ease and authority. No. 1, Jonathan Kuminga pic.twitter.com/IiIsaLsEB2 JK what was that??? 📺 NBA League Pass pic.twitter.com/7chWeOeMI6 Kuminga in the first half scored nine points on 4-of-6 shooting and had four assists. His fourth was a dime to Pat Spencer cutting into the paint for a layup. But Kuminga also didn’t have one rebound at halftime, led the Warriors with five turnovers and was a game-low minus-18. There were highs and lows in Kuminga’s third game of the preseason. Kuminga played 22 minutes and scored an efficient 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting. He dominated around the rim, but missed his only 2-point shot outside the paint and badly forced one of his three 3-point attempts. Jonathan Kuminga dominated around the rim Kind of an up-and-down game, but the process has been positive pic.twitter.com/LpHp35Fgu3 The process overall has been positive. Kuminga is keeping his eyes up and mostly has been in flow of the offense. He finished with no rebounds, six assists and five turnovers as a minus-10. Between offseason additions and the development of certain players, Kerr has raved over the space these Warriors can create. He now can have an offense that plays four-out, or even five-out. When at full strength, that is. The end of the first quarter saw a unit of Pat Spencer, Will Richard, Payton, Gui Santos and Trayce Jackson-Davis struggle to score with very little spacing. None of those five are considered threats to shoot from long distance. The start of the second quarter also was a struggle. That group featured Podziemski, Hield, Kuminga, Santos and Jackson-Davis. Those five give Kerr one surefire 3-point threat in Hield, and a hopeful second with Podziemski. The Warriors as a team in the first half shot 19 percent from three, going 4 of 21. Payton was the only bench player to make a three, and no Warrior made multiple threes. They also didn’t attempt a single free throw in the first half, while the Lakers went 13 of 15 at the line. After making only four 3-pointers in the first half, the Warriors made three in the first two and a half minutes of the third quarter – two by Post and one from Podziemski – and five for the entire quarter. The Warriors made two more threes than the Lakers, 14 to 12, but shot a lowly 32.6 percent, which was far lower than LA’s 44.4 percent clip. Podziemski, Post and LJ Cryer were the only Warriors to make more than one three. Richard (1 of 6), Santos (1 of 5) and Spencer (1 of 5) combined to go 3 of 17 on threes.

Embiid featured Sunday in the Sixers’ annual Blue-White scrimmage at Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington, Delaware. And he shared the floor with another big man in Adem Bona. Nurse confirmed after the scrimmage that he’s “trying to look at Bona and Joel together.” With Paul George sidelined as he works back from a left knee injury and Trendon Watford out because of right hamstring tightness, it’s not yet clear how the Sixers will divvy up power forward minutes. Two-way contract player Dominick Barlow has played well this preseason and fellow two-way Jabari Walker has also been in the mix. Bona is an unconventional option, although Nurse noted his role may not change much alongside Embiid. The 22-year-old stuck almost exclusively to dunks, layups, put-backs and the occasional post-up his rookie year. In contrast, Embiid’s jump shooting and overall array of offensive skills have historically been giant strengths. “I think there’s kind of an open position at the four, especially right now with Paul not being quite ready yet,” Nurse said. “There’s a number of guys that we’re trying to work into that spot. … (Bona) is probably going to be more of the five. He’s going to play down toward the basket, rim protect and things like that. There’s certainly some drives and dump-offs to him … that are high-percentage plays. I like that part. He’ll help the rebounding, he’ll help the rim protection. We’ll see how it goes.”’ Bona brought his typical shot swatting to the scrimmage and stared down Johni Broome after denying the rookie a dunk. He’s pleased at the prospect of playing next to Embiid. “I think it brings another dynamic to the team,” Bona said. “It’s going to bring a huge amount of size and presence in the paint.” While Bona measured a tad over 6-foot-8 without shoes at the NBA draft combine , he indeed plays much bigger. The UCLA product’s wingspan is a shade under 7-4. He posted a 40-inch maximum vertical leap at the combine and sure seems to have added to that. Of course, most Sixers projections ride on Embiid’s health. He scrimmaged Sunday, moved smoothly and scored plenty. Joel Embiid with the slam at Sixers’ Blue-White scrimmage: pic.twitter.com/ocr2k27ZJd The Sixers have avoided timelines in discussing Embiid’s return from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. The scrimmage was his first live action in front of a crowd since Feb. 22. “I knew this would be the first time you guys had seen him for a long time,” Nurse said. “I don’t know how many weeks this is now — I’m losing track — but he’s been out there playing. Again, just trying to continue to progress. “Today was a good progression day. Lots of running, lots of 5-on-5, lots of early practice stuff, lots of 5-on-0. … And then he went out there and did his thing. He shot the ball well, he scored well, he orchestrated the offense well. I thought he ran pretty good as well — both directions.” Bona would love to see all of that translate to games. When the Sixers drafted him, he envisioned frontcourt minutes with Embiid. “I’ve been working toward that,” he said, “and I’m really excited to see how that’s going to look.”"}

Brooklyn is going to lean into Cam Thomas — playing for his next contract on the qualifying offer — and Michael Porter Jr. to drive their offense. But if you had any doubts about the plan, here is what team owner Joe Tsai said while on the All-In podcast (hat tip RealGM ). “I have to say we’re in a rebuilding year. We spent all of our pick (in the 2025 NBA Draft). We had five first-round draft picks this past summer ... “We have one [first-round] pick in 2026, and we hope to get a good pick. So, you can predict what kind of strategy we will use for this season. But we have a very young team.” This upcoming NBA Draft is considered a strong draft at the top with Darryn Peterson (Kansas), A.J. Dybantsa (BYU) and Cameron Boozer (Duke) all in the mix for the No. 1 pick, with some other real talent such as Nate Ament (Tennessee), Mikel Brown (Louisville) and Tounde Yessoufou (Baylor) worth keeping an eye on. Brooklyn isn’t the only team starting this season with an eye toward the draft, the same idea is playing out in Utah and Washington, and you can be sure a few other teams with long-shot postseason hopes will be pivoting to the strategy early. The Nets control their own pick this season, but in 2027 the Houston Rockets have swap rights. Starting in 2028, the Nets will have their own first-round picks and/or first-round picks or swaps coming in from the Knicks, 76ers and Nuggets. A Division of NBCUniversal .

He chose not to pick up his $3.5 million player option in Denver (not a shock after he had a locker room clash with Aaron Gordon during the playoffs), but no team has stepped up yet with a deal to replace it. Despite rumored offers for him in China, Westbrook is staying put stateside, and his most likely landing spot remains the team he flirted with all summer, the Sacramento Kings. Here is what ESPN’s Shams Charania reported on NBA Today . “I’m told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings. And the Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that, and he’s got relationships across that organization. Domantas Sabonis, he’s close with, played with him. He played with Dennis Schroeder as well, DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine. They have L.A. ties as well. BJ Armstrong, the new assistant general manager there. He knows BJ Armstrong from the agency side, and he does have respect with Scott Perry, their new general manager, and Doug Christie, their new head coach. We’ll see if a deal gets done before the start of the season or during this upcoming year.” Charania is not the only one reporting this, well-connected Sacramento radio guy Carmichael Dave called it “70/30 Russell Westbrook joins the Kings this year.” If the sides can figure out the money. Sacramento does have an open roster spot and is about $5.4 million below the luxury tax line. Dennis Schroder will start at the point, but unless second-year player Devin Carter is ready to make a big leap up to backup point guard, that role falls more to Malik Monk, who is better as an off-ball two guard (but can play some point). It’s easy to see where he slots into the roster, the question is money. Westbrook, 37, averaged 13.3 points and 6.1 assists a game last season for the Nuggets, and he remains one of the highest energy players in the game. However, he’s not a consistent or efficient scorer at this point in his career, nor is he a great defender. He could fill a bench role, as he has done the past couple of seasons, but don’t be shocked if we get into the season before a team makes that offer. Sacramento is also a roster that could look very different at the end of the season. This is a team open to trading DeRozan, LaVine or Sabonis if the deal is right. Where Westbrook would slot into all that is a question for coach Doug Christie. A Division of NBCUniversal .

At some point during the Lakers ’ preseason, Luka Doncic will play in a game. The question is when. Even after being a full participant in practice Saturday, Lakers coach JJ Redick said that Doncic was “TBD” (to be determined) when asked if his star guard would play in Sunday’s exhibition game against the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. Redick said Austin Reaves will play and that Marcus Smart will see action in his first preseason game of the season. The Lakers will play six preseason games, three of them coming after the game against the Warriors. After practice, Doncic was asked when he would play. Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue “I don’t know yet,” he said. “We got to talk about it — JJ and my team. So, I don’t know yet. But I’m probably going to end up playing two games of the preseason.” When the regular season starts Oct. 21 at home against the Warriors, Doncic will not have running mate LeBron James beside him. James was diagnosed with sciatica nerve issue on his right side, the Lakers announced to the media Thursday, saying that he’ll be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks. James and Doncic formed a great partnership when they played together after the shocking blockbuster trade last February. Not having James to start the season has to be unsettling for Doncic and the Lakers. “It’s a big change,” Doncic said. “He’s a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be next man up. We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be next man up. That’s it.” Doncic will get plenty of help from Reaves, Smart, Deandre Ayton, Jared Vanderbilt and others with James out. Still, the assumption is that Doncic will have to carry a heavy load with James sidelined. “No. I don’t view it that way,” Doncic said. “I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.” James hasn’t practiced at all, but Doncic said that hasn’t stopped the two of them from figuring out the team can still function at a high level. “It’s not everything about on the court. That’s what I’ve been saying,” Doncic said. “It’s about chemistry off the court, too. So, obviously, now it’s a little more off the court, but while we watched practices this week, we talked a lot about it.” They had known over the summer that James had been dealing with “the nerve irritation,” Redick said, and so it wasn’t a total surprise James is going to be out with a sciatica issue. Redick said James has been on the court “every day” doing individual work. He just hasn’t been able to practice with his teammates. Redick was asked how James' inability to participate in practice affected his game planning for practice and going into the season knowing that he won’t be available for a while. \" No, no effect on practice planning,” Redick said. “And we haven't game-planned yet, so, no effect.” Redick had not put too much emphasis on his starting lineup during training camp and during the preseason games. But with James turning 41 in December, entering his 23rd season and being injured in training camp, Redick was asked if he could foresee having a lineup with James starting and another with him out. \" Potentially. Yeah,” he said. “Something that certainly has crossed my mind in the last couple days. Yeah…You hope that he's back soon. That's, those things are, those things can be tricky. So it, I don't think it's … “We knew this going into camp, so it wasn't like it's changed anything for how we want to practice or what our philosophies are with the preseason games. It is unclear who's gonna be, what the starting lineup is gonna be. That's the reality until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A spokesperson for the teams gave ESPN this statement: “The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved. The Parties are focused on the future.” The lawsuit was over something seen as commonplace in NBA circles (sources who had been in similar jobs told NBC Sports at the time that this was no big deal and the suit seemed “very James Dolan”). New York was seeking $10 million in damages from Toronto for the alleged “theft of trade secrets” when the Raptors hired away New York’s director of video/analytics/and a player development assistant coach, Ikechukwu Azotam. In the suit, the Knicks alleged that the Raptors organization — at the behest of rookie head coach Darko Rajakovic — took more than 3,000 confidential, proprietary files, including video scouting files and play frequency numbers. Part of the Knicks’ argument was that Rajakovic didn’t have the depth of background to build a team structure, so he stole that from New York. That despite the fact that Rajakovic had been a legendary head coach in Serbia, was head coach of the Tulsa 66ers of the G-League, and was an assistant known for player development with the Thunder, Suns and Grizzlies. Toronto’s first counterargument was that this had to be decided by the NBA league office and commissioner Adam Silver, not the courts. Toronto reached out to the NBA’s general council and pointed out that the NBA’s constitution (Article 24, bylaw “D”) states: “The Commissioner shall have exclusive, full, complete, and final jurisdiction of any dispute involving two (2) or more Members of the Association.” Dolan, who has had a long-running feud with Silver, did not feel the commissioner would be an unbiased arbiter of the situation.

That staff was also together for the World Cup in the Philippines the year before. Kerr said being an assistant coach for Team USA matters before moving over to the big chair. “I think the assistant coaching is almost a prerequisite for coaching USA,” Kerr said. “It’s really a different job, and now he has that experience, just like I did with [Gregg Popovich], in the World Cup in ’19 and the Olympics in ’21. “Spo is a perfect choice. He’s gonna be great.” Spoelstra is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA, entering his 18th season, and has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (2012 and 2013). In a sign of how respected he is around the league, a poll of NBA GMs voted him the “best coach in the NBA” as well as the best manager and motivator of players. Spoelstra’s contract with USA Basketball is not finalized and has to be approved by the organization’s board of directors, but that is all expected to be wrapped up before the end of the month.

However, there’s one trait of his that head coach Jason Kidd is most impressed by, according to Eddie Sefko of NBA.com : his toughness. “ His willingness to compete at a high level and his willingness to be uncomfortable ,” Kidd said when asked what parts of Flagg’s games stood out early on. “ He absorbs that. I think those are his superpowers. His winning DNA â he stood in line a little bit longer to get that at a very high level. Heâs all about winning. â Kidd spoke excitedly about the potential of Flagg and young center Dereck Lively II to grow together, as well as their ability to impact winning in the near-term. That quality, along with the toughness, is what Kidd values the most in Flagg. “ Itâs not about how many shots he gets or how many minutes or how many times he touches the ball ,” Kidd said. “ Heâs about the team. Heâs about winning. Thatâs the biggest thing that stands out — he competes to win .” We have more on the Mavs: Start Washington and Gafford until mid season then start Flagg and Lively I also think they should take their time with Flagg. PJ can start, no big deal. Eventually Cooper will get his mins.

According to head Steve Kerr , the Warriors are “not too concerned” about the injury, which occurred in practice. Slater adds that the team is hopeful that Moody can return in time for the season opener. Moody started both of the Warriors’ preseason games to this point, averaging 14.5 points and 1.0 steal per contest while hitting seven of his 12 three-point attempts. After years of being in and out of the Warriors’ rotation, Moody seems to have finally carved out a role for himself as a floor spacer and versatile wing defender in Kerr’s main rotation. If he were to miss time to open the season, it could open the door for Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield to earn extra minutes. Right when he looked primed for a true breakout season…I will say this, as much as I love his game, profile and overall potential, Moses Moody sure is injury prone. I do comp him to Kawhi pretty often, I see “something in the realm of Kawhi” as Moody’s highest ceiling, like, his best season could be on that level. If he can stop being injured. Much like Kawhi. Every time he starts looking like he is ready to take it to the next level he gets hurt. Just a strained calf. I think heâll be fine. The life of a professional athlete involves setbacks from time to time. Moses Moody Postseason Stats – NBA | FOX Sports In the 2025 NBA playoffs, Moses Moody averaged 16 mins, 7.1 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 1.2 assists across 12 games. Yeah if next level is Rotation player. Seriously. You spent months trashing everyone who had one criticism of Kuminga. Now you feel it is ok for you to trash anyone. What a hypocrite. He played 3 months with a torn ligament in his shooting hand. It was painful for him to shoot. Gawd. How pathetic. I never spent time trashing anyone.. only you and Warriors fans did the trashing of Kuminga. Get it right !!!! I said you are all crybabies for trashing him. And now You are defending Moody cause I said he was a rotation player. Sounds like more crying to me. What is he like the next Poole !!!!! For months, you went on and on about how the Warriors had to dump their offense, that had sent them to six finals, and four rings, and install Kuminga as their #1 offensive threat. You kept crying about how Kuminga is the Second Coming. You kept lashing out at people who said he needs to look learn to work with in the offense. Moody learned work within the offense and started have some success before he got injured. He gritted it out for the team. Why can’t you give him some credit for that? Moody is definitely not like Poole. Damn bro you keep receipts on here? Make up all you want. I donât care if Warriors win or lose. I donât care if they win the title. I only posted about Kuminga and the crybabies. I just said Moody was a rotation player. Thats a problem for you lmao â¦.. you drunk lol Poole was the next Curry for a time for Warrior fans on here. So what is exactly your fascination with Moody. More than a ROTATION player ???? That makes him the next Poole â- who is a 1way player but does put up 17-18 a game. The kleenex are on tgeir way DoorDash If you don’t care about the Warriors, then why did you keep spending months whining and crying about how Kuminga is a victim. You kept saying that should be the Warriors #1 scorer. Moody is nothing like Poole. Moody just goes about his business working hard and contributing. Poole said was “legendary” after one good season. How can you confuse the two? Calling out Warriors fans tor their trashing of Kuminga. Is only posting the truth. Making fun of Warriors fans incessant whining and crying about Kumingas status. Was entertaining a bit. Considering how all you have jumped on the bandwagon. Iâm sure there is much more Kuminga drama to come. You can be sure I will be watching. So why are you avoiding the question. Is Moody going to be the guy to watch this year. Cause him starting or even playing more than 20 mins. Is a step up for him. Or did you miss All of last year. There you go again. JK is such a delicate little flower. We are all such meanies. You can never have criticisms about him. He is such the perfect little child. I guess you missed all of last year. Moody played well over 20 minutes a game and doubled his career starts in the 2nd half of the season while in a playoff push. I thought you knew everything. The gym class hero had a couple lucky preseason games and got everyone all hyped up. Needed to fabricate a new excuse for when he falls off the next game he plays. He faked it just like Keegan Murray. Keegan literally having surgery, hard to fake that Surgery is literally one of the easiest things to fake. You just put a cast on and people will believe you. And Moody had surgery also. But, you kept saying he lied about it. You still haven’t presented proof he lied. I did not say that. And you still haven’t presented proof that I did Oh excuse me. You said he “faked” the injury and surgery. So, when he talked about it after he “fake recovery”, is that still “faking” it? Or it that lying? I did not say that, and you still have not presented proof that I did Moses Moody still sucks. He always has. Heâs in over his head. But his shooting could be useful in the starting lineup with this bunch. In fact, theyâll need him for that. Heâs still going to get shipped out of town in February along with JK for whatever they can get as a rotational guy. The writing is on the wall and Iâm never wrong (lol just kidding.) Same as this Victor Oladipo talk this week, lol. I think somebody here trashed me for saying âheâs doneâ earlier in the summer. Is it necessary for me to say it again? Victor Oladipo is done. Mac McClung does not belong in the NBA. Thereâs no way Jonathan Kuminga takes the qualifying offer. Al Horford is absolutely signing with the Warriors. Moses Moody sucks. What else do you want to know? Start Heild. Have Moody be the sixth man type âAfter years of being in and out of the Warriorsâ rotation, Moody seems to have finally carved out a role for himself as a floor spacer and versatile wing defender in Kerrâs main rotation. If he were to miss time, it could open the door for Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield to earn extra minutes.â The article and his own coach. Consider a rotation piece, player a step UP. Yet some of us canât handle that. Doesnât seem like a serious injury. Nobody is game shape yet. Always better to be cautious with injuries at this time. Kuminga and Podz have looked good against Lakers Wow surprised by the amount of hate Moody is getting on this comment section, just not what I thought I’d see I canât speak for anyone else, but I know Iâve thrown a lot of negativity his way and for practically his entire time here. But what are we supposed to do? Heâs not very good. I have given him respect for becoming a pretty good shooter and I think the Warriors can use that for the time being. But heâs not a rotation guy on a playoff team. He really isnât. Is that hating? I think itâs an analysis of his game. How can you literally hate someone who works hard, does what heâs asked, is a fantastic teammate, and is a good kid? I donât think thatâs possible lol Please login to leave a reply.

The injury, which Niang suffered during offseason training and conditioning, was announced on September 27. At that time, the Jazz said that Niang would be reevaluated in two weeks. The newest update confirms that he is progressing in his rehabilitation, but there is still no definitive return date. Niang’s return to Utah this summer came in the form of a trade by the Celtics aimed at freeing up cap space, as he was dealt along with two second-round picks for rookie RJ Luis . Niang split last season between the Hawks and Cavaliers, and held season averages of 9.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game. The career 39.9% three-point shooter played four seasons with Utah from 2017-21 and appeared in 23 playoff games for the team, averaging 5.0 points in 13.0 minutes. The Jazz, in the midst of a rebuild, reportedly value Niang for the impact he could have as a veteran among the many young players on their roster. That’s it, JAZZ have to tank this season.

One idea they’ve pushed in the preseason, according to Hunter Patterson of The Athletic , is giving third-year wing Ausar Thompson more primary ball-handling duties. While Thompson’s ball-in-hand role last season was mostly limited to fastbreaks and dunks off drop-offs, the Pistons are expanding his role in the lead-up to this season to see how he handles it, Patterson writes. “ Thatâs something weâre going to do more of ,” head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “ The tempo that [Thompson] plays at when he has the ball in his hands, and the threat that he becomes when he has the ball in his hands changes the way that teams have to guard him. He has the ability to make his teammates better .” Patterson points to Thompson’s ability to change speeds and use both his strength and quick-twitch athleticism to get to the rim or beat defenders as key reasons why giving him the ball more is intriguing. Bickerstaff is also interested in exploring different ways to free up Cunningham off-ball to get him easier looks. “ Teams decide they want to pick Cade up full court, and sometimes because of the gravity he holds, people just hug up on him ,” Bickerstaff said. “ Now his defender has to play off a screen or off a shift, and it just makes him a better offensive player when people canât get their hands on him to wrestle and hold him .” While Thompson still has to tighten his handle, the team has seen encouraging signs. “ Ausar is a guy who can initiate offense at a high level ,” Cunningham said. “ Giving him room to get more and more comfortable with it as the preseason goes along, I think thatâll be a big weapon for us .” We have more notes from the Pistons: Cade and the undersized Pistons Seems this writer for the Athletic. Doesnât know who Jaden Ivey is. Cause he is the other guard on this team. And more than capable of doing all the things. He claims they are teaching Thompson. Ivey is a big addition this year. He is a playmaker with a good handle. Who is capable of putting up 20 a night. I would start Thompson at SG and play Ivey as your super sixth man I sort of donât mind that Ivey is being overlooked right now. It might be a slow start for him, coming back from a broken leg, but watch for him to be a featured guy in those articles in the second half of the season. Please login to leave a reply.

Murray, who injured his thumb late in the second quarter of Friday’s preseason game vs. Portland, will undergo surgery to address the tear and will be reevaluated in four-to-six weeks, according to the Kings. It’s unfortunate timing for Murray, who is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension between now and October 20. While his injury likely won’t impact the Kings’ long-term view of him or significantly impact those negotiations, the 25-year-old won’t have the opportunity to make a final case for a new deal on the court this week in the team’s two remaining preseason games. The fourth overall pick in the 2022 draft, Murray had a promising rookie season in which he averaged 12.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, shot 41.1% from beyond the three-point line, and finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting as he started 78 games for Sacramento. The 6’8″ forward has remained a starter for the Kings in the two years since then and has improved as a defender, but hasn’t taken a step forward offensively. In 2024/25, he averaged 12.4 PPG on .444/.343/.833 shooting while playing a career-high 34.3 minutes per night. If Murray, who is earning roughly $11.1MM this season, doesn’t sign a rookie scale extension by next Monday, he’ll be on track for free agency during the summer of 2026. The Kings would have to tender him a qualifying offer worth approximately $14.7MM to make him a restricted free agent at that time. It’s unclear who will take Murray’s spot in the starting five while he recovers, but forward Nique Clifford started the second half in his place on Friday alongside Dennis SchrÃ¶der , Zach LaVine , DeMar DeRozan , and Domantas Sabonis . Dario Saric and Doug McDermott are among the team’s other options at forward — if head coach Doug Christie wants to roll with a guard-heavy lineup, he could make Malik Monk or Keon Ellis a starter. Poor Kings fans. My sincere best wishes for a full recovery. This isnt his fault, but I feel like Murray has been very disappointing after his rookie season He’s gotten much better defensively and with rebounding, but his offense has taken a hit. Offense took a dip because the worst run franchise in the NBA wanted to be the Sacramento Bulls and run the same team the bulls had. Levine is a 3rd Star making 1star money. DeMar DeRozan is cooked and should be a bench scorer. And sabonis is a PF playing center. He was already an older rookie so the development was limited. He seems pretty one dimensional and lacks the attacking to rim moves. Defense is okay. Although this is a bit of a hit for the kings, it’s early in the season so it allows Christie to give other guys more time. Let’s see if Saric can slide into a starting role and be consistent. Also it’s a great opportunity for Christie to experiment with mall ball lineups with Monk playing with the starters. I think they would use Ellis over Monk in a small ball starting lineup. You can’t have Monk, Demar, and Lavine all at once due to no defense and they all want shots. He’s gotta be faking it, according to you. How so? Or is this just another one of your delusions?

According to Sam Yip of HoopsHype , Oladipo’s plan is to evaluate his options and potential next steps once the preseason is over. Oladipo held his own against NBA players in Guangzhou’s first two games on Monday and Thursday, registering 20 points and five steals in 29 minutes vs. San Antonio, then putting up 24 points and five assists in 27 minutes against the Clippers. However, the 33-year-old guard tells Yip that nothing came of a July workout in Las Vegas in front of NBA teams. “People show interest, but again, with the new CBA, with contracts and stuff, people can only do so much,” Oladipo said. “So time will tell when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll be ready for it.” Representatives from European teams also reportedly attended Oladipo’s workout in Las Vegas, and while he didn’t rule out the possibility of playing overseas, the former No. 2 overall pick suggested he’s not seriously entertaining that idea at the moment. “You know, if push comes to shove and that’s the last option, we’ll see. I’m definitely one of the best. So that’s where I belong is the three letters: N-B-A,” he told Yip with a laugh.

Throughout the offseason, Westbrook has been repeatedly linked to the Kings , and ESPN’s Shams Charania reported on Friday that the two sides continue to have “strong mutual interest” ( Twitter video link ). “ Iâm told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings ,” Charania said (hat tip to Kurt Helin of NBC Sports ). “ And the Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that, and heâs got relationships across that organization. “ Domantas Sabonis , heâs close with, played with him. He played with Dennis SchrÃ¶der as well. DeMar DeRozan , Zach LaVine , they have L.A. ties as well. BJ Armstrong , the new assistant general manager there. He knows BJ Armstrong from the agency side, and he does have respect with Scott Perry , their new general manager, and Doug Christie , their new head coach. “ Weâll see if a deal gets done before the start of the season or during this upcoming year .” Carmichael Dave of SactownSports.com ( Twitter link ) posits that there’s about a 70 percent chance that Westbrook will sign with Sacramento at some point, assuming the two sides can figure out the financials. The plugged-in radio host also hears Westbrook has a lucrative contract offer on the table to play in China, but the former NBA MVP likely wouldn’t go that route until after the All-Star game, which is in his hometown of Los Angeles. The Kings currently only have 13 players on guaranteed standard contracts, plus Keon Ellis on a non-guaranteed deal and Terence Davis on a training camp pact. Westbrook, 36, played a significant role for the Nuggets after signing with Denver as a free agent during the 2024 offseason. He averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals in 27.9 minutes per game across 75 appearances (36 starts) during the regular season, with a .449/.323/.661 shooting line. He also contributed 11.7 PPG, 2.6 APG, and 3.7 RPG in 13 playoff contests (24.1 MPG). That would be a great pick up for the kings. Push the ball, hit the wings and clean up the trail At the least, he’d add some competitive fire to a team badly in need of it. Arrow down for last year’s lottery pick, Devin Carter. He’d be the third-string PG. 4th Elis is combo guard, can play pg, in fact they played best last season with him in lineup Sorry, I didnt understand, did you imply he would be behind Devin Carter in the depth chart? Schroder Westbrook Ellis Carter is what he’s implying yes Interesting, I dont see Devin Carter being that good but tbh I havent paid that much attention to him. Wouldn’t they still be trying to trade Carter since they were trying to in order to make room for Russ? I wish the Heat would sign him. Westbrook is a heck of an athlete. Hard to imagine he is considering playing in China even with big money in playð° Stick a fork in this bum At this point, I think Russ is interested in any team lol I wonder how much he gets. IMO, an upgrade over Shamet or Brogdon. I guess he didn’t want to come to New York I love the Knicks I like Westbrook I do not want Westbrook on this Knicks team. Rockets should be doing all they can to sign Westbrook. He can help hold it down. Till Rockets are able to make a trade (Dec 15). Then he just adds to their depth. Westbrook fits the Kings. He and Schroder make a good combo at PG. Russ is fun to watch due to the high effort he plays with. If he was on the Kings they would play fast but not going to stop many opponents. He would have to play with some form of Lavine and Monk. I don’t think Demar will run every time. Please login to leave a reply.

Terry’s camp has not had any “serious discussions” with the Bulls about a new deal, according to Cowley. Terry will remain eligible for a rookie scale extension until October 20 . The 23-year-old is entering the final year of his contract, which will pay him about $5.4MM in ’25/26. The Bulls could make Terry a restricted free agent next summer if they tender him a qualifying offer, though that seems far from certain given the way his first three seasons have played out. A 6’7″ swingman who was selected 18th overall in the 2022 draft after two college seasons at Arizona, Terry has struggled to establish himself as a reliable rotation player to this point in his career. He appeared in a career-high 73 games last season, holding relatively modest averages of 4.5 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 13.5 minutes per contest. Terry, who switched jersey numbers (from No. 25 to No. 7) as he looks for a fresh start this fall, readily acknowledges ’25/26 is a “big year” for his career. He tells Cowley he’s looking to one of his former teammates for inspiration. “ This is how I think everybody views it ,” Terry said. “ They view it as Iâm not a guy that scores 20, 30 points. Well, I got drafted to be like [former Bulls guard] Alex Caruso : ‘OK, he can guard, he can do all the little things, he can be a connector.’ Thatâs what I strive to be this year. “ Like, even [in the Bullsâ preseason victory Thursday against the Cavaliers], in my eyes, I played like [expletive]. But you look at the box score, and Iâm guarding Donovan Mitchell . I was tough on him. Guarding De’Andre Hunter . I was tough on him. I have to live like that, you know? “ I remember being in the locker room [when] AC was still here, and some days he would have six points and some days he would have 20 points. Thatâs just the way itâs going to be. I have to hang my hat on the defensive end. So when people try to put pressure on what I should be, Iâm just going to be myself .” “Be a connector” dude will be on the Warriors so fast I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for that QO but we are talking about the Bulls here.

However, the 6’11” forward/center sustained a torn tendon in his left foot in May, an injury that was expected to sideline him for three months, and he wound up going undrafted. Lakhin, who ranked third on ESPN’s list of 2025 prospects among players who weren’t drafted, played three college seasons at Cincinnati prior to transferring to Clemson for his senior year. In 34 games for the Tigers in 2024/25, the Russian big man averaged 11.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.0 steal and 1.5 blocks in 23.6 minutes per contest, with a shooting line of .507/.375/.696. While the terms of the contract were not disclosed, it’s safe to assume Oklahoma City signed Lakhin to a non-guaranteed Exhibit 10 deal. If he’s waived before the season begins and spends at least 60 days with the G League’s OKC Blue, Lakhin could earn a bonus worth up to $85,300. Exhibit 10 contracts can also be converted to two-way deals, and the Thunder do have a two-way opening. A promotion for Lakhin seems unlikely given the timing of the signing, but it’s technically still a possibility. The Thunder are now back at the offseason limit of 21 players under contract.

While a deal is expected to be completed, it has not yet been finalized, and a 76ers source tells Pompey the Trail Blazers are “still involved.” Beauchamp signed an Exhibit 10 deal with Portland on September 30 prior to being waived on Oct. 7, lining him up to join the Blazers’ G League affiliate, the Rip City Remix. If he were to be signed and waived by the Sixers, Portland could still have first dibs on naming Beauchamp an affiliate player, but it sounds like his camp is trying to steer him to the Delaware Blue Coats instead. Beauchamp, who turns 25 years old today (happy birthday), was the 24th overall pick of the 2022 draft. He spent his first two-and-a-half years with the Bucks, the team that drafted him, prior to being dealt to the Clippers ahead of the February trade deadline. He finished 2024/25 on a two-way contract with the Knicks after being cut by Los Angeles.

Assuming Beauchamp finalizes his Exhibit 10 deal with Philadelphia and is waived before the season begins, he would be eligible for a bonus worth up to $85,300 if he joins the Blue Coats and spends at least 60 days with the club. Exhibit 10 contracts can also be converted into two-way deals, though the 76ers do not currently have a two-way opening.

After going with a small-ball approach in the preseason opener while bringing Al Horford off the bench in his Golden State debut, Kerr made Horford a starter against the Trail Blazers along with Stephen Curry , Moses Moody , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . âThat could be a really powerful combo,â Kerr said. âI didnât have a great sense of it after the game because I was thinking so much of our turnovers and our lack of focus at times during the first half. But looking at the tape, it was a lot better than I expected for those first seven minutes or so.â Kerr likes having more size on the court to start the game, especially with Horford, who shoots well enough from three-point range to give everyone else plenty of room to operate. The group only played together for a little more than half of the first quarter before Kerr began making substitutions, and the veterans rested in the second half. âYou can tell with all the different lineups, we know that thereâs still going to be a lot to work on in terms of the chemistry and just the certain combinations,â Curry said. âThatâs part of the journey of training camp. But I just like the vibe and the intentionality that weâre all coming with, understanding that we need to get off to a good start. And trying to make that happen.â There’s more on the Warriors: Start Heild not Moody Interesting. So yes, I think the starting lineup should be Curry Moody Butler Green Horford. Sounds like when things are right thatâs the best starting 5. Perhaps this has been suggested the last month or so? I donât know.., maybe? ari, easymoneyrider, peter contrope, nba is ok, davey j ..,? You gentlemen certainly have an opinion here? I agree with that starting 5, but I am hoping we can see at least a few minutes of what Curry Butler Green Kuminga Horford looks like. Moody canât start. He has no handle lol â¦.. Donât think heâd get much chances to handle anyways with Green facilitating a lot of the offence, Curry the go to guy and then Butler as your secondary scoring option and what third ball handler? It would be more of a catch and shoot role and be good defensively Handle means able to take your defender off the dribble. Handle means able to bring the ball up. Handle means able to push the ball. Handle means able to handle ball pressure. Handle means able to make decisions while handling ball. Handle means making decisions with ball pressure against good D. Green nor Horford are guards. Neither has a good handle. Moody is more a wing and doesnât have a good handle. His decision making I donât really know. Jimmy is not a guard. He is more a SF that can be considered a wing. Jimmy can handle the ball and make decisions. But you donât want him to be the only one. Curry is usually the one who ends up with ball. He can handle the ball and make decisions. Except his main job is to score. Curry is not a PG. He actually plays more like a wing. Cause Warriors use him so much off the ball. Kuminga has a handle. But his decision making is not there yet nor is his shot. He is best now off the bench. Warriors offense is built for playmakers and shooters. Playmaker always has a handle. Looks like Kerr has decided that’s his starting lineup. Moody’s already hurt, so it could turn out to be Podz at the 2 Good, lets see what Podz can do here. I like the idea of Al shooting and Podz rebounding. Podz is a Russell Westbrook-type guy, and as GP2 proved, those types DO have a role in Kerr’s rotations, and often succeed when paired with Steph. It’s a more chaotic element that this slow, old team will need to deploy when the other team finds a rhythm on both sides. One thing I think is imperative for this upcoming games is to try and get a non-oldies rotation to gel and be reliable in case of injury/days off for being old. To get through the whole season with the oldies ready for the playoffs, the younger guys must step up and more importantly, be able to gel with whatever oldies are active and more importantly with each other. Post Kuminga Moody Hield Podz is one rotation I’d love to see Post TJD Kuminga Moody Podz is another Santos and Buddy also are two more who need to step up. Oddly, Buddy is officially “everyday Buddy” who never misses a game, so he can be counted on being there as much as anyone can be. What a remarkable run of health, how does he do it? What he does need to be is more consistent. Now is his time to step up and show he’s still the guy he was on the Pacers, if he does, GSW is in tremendous shape. Santos is in a make or break year too. Need all these guys at their best this year, but aside from Kuminga, who still is in his head too much, I like all their chances. Kerr is the best coach in the league and will figure it out. Maybe Kuminga will play more if he actually gives it full effort. Moody starting? Damn this team is already imploding and the season hasn’t even started yet He would be the SG. He is shooting great. What is your complaint? He sucks at shooting So far as a starter in the 2 preseason games, he’s shot 11-21 (52.3%) overall and 7-12 from three (58.3%). Certainly above average! This is just like your claim that Curry is getting divorced because of something that happened over 15 years ago. He didn’t suck at shooting last season. Yes he did In the 60 games before the injury, he shot 45%/39%/78% avging 10 ppg, and the Warriors were 36-24 in those games. Big D is just a warrior hater so itâs a bias opinion. Obviously. I’m curious, what happened to your arc89 profile? Somebody must hate me because it will not allow me to Post. I think I know who it is a laker fan that posted political stuff on here. Unfortunately this site just deletes profiles instead of looking into it. I am Jimmy Kimmel. Lol Incorrect, I’m purely an objective observer, as I have already proven when you were liking my pro warriors comments. Now that the objectivity doesn’t go your way, you now only dislike my comments. That is peak example of being boas 1. Just wrong. 2. The “injury” never happened. Which is why the April, after the alleged injury, was his 3rd highest shooting month of the year. Try again 1. The stats from those 60 games before the game he was injured in are facts. 2. Players don’t get surgery for nonexistent injuries. The playoffs, where he shot 35% overall/33% from three were in April. LMAO! The surgery was in May because the injury was in May. Those are not facts you’re reading the wrong information. The alleged injury happened March. In February he shot 35%. In April he shot 37%. Try again, and this time at least make it make sense. lMaO He shot 48%/41% in March before the injury. Prove me wrong. Wrong. Proved. So, you have no source for your shooting stats? I do Are you saying he faked the injury and never had surgery?? No In the 10 games he played in February, he shot 47%. (game log linked). Why do you lie so much? link to basketball-reference.com In the 10 games he played in February, he shot 35%. (Game log linked). Why do you lie so much? link to basketball-reference.com So are you blind, or just stupid? As your posting the same link I did conclusively proves, he shot 47% overall and 36% from three pt range, and 83% from the ft line. So are you blind or just stupid? As your posting the same link I did conclusively proves, he shot 35% from three pt range So which is it? 1. You claimed he shot 35% in February, when he actually shot 47%. Since you didn’t refer to a subset of where shots were taken from, you were off by 12%. 2. FYI, according to established mathematical convention for rounding fractions of a percent, 35.8% rounds up to 36%, not down to 35%, for obvious reasons (if not stupid, ofc). Prove that he is lying about his surgery. Cite your source for his monthly shooting stats. Prove that he’s telling the truth about his surgery. You are the one making the allegation that he never had surgery on his thumb. It is up to you to back up your claim. So, backup your claim. No I’m not, you said he had surgery first. I didn’t bring it up, you did, therefore it’s your allegation. It is up to you to prove the allegation, So back up your claim. You said Moody lied about having surgery. You need to prove he lied. I did not say that. That’s just another delusion of yours So proud of Moody. A year ago, most of the fans here wanted him gone and thought he was only worthy of less than half of his contract. Heâs playing with more confidence now, less hesitant, and making quicker decisions. He knows he belongs now. Kudos to Moody who also deserved more playing earlier in his career. Yea players tend to play with confidence in the preseason. He should be preseason mvp He shot well last year â¦. my critique is his handle. .374% 3pt, .519% 2pt, .80% FT â¦.. his 2pt shooting was down last year. .520% is still considered good shooting. 37% is pretty weak if your only job is to be a shooter. Should be hovering around 40% especially when you’re playing with Curry NBA considers 34% 3pt shooting respectable. And good. Cause of the analytics. And if you bothered to look at his stats you would know. He shot .425% 3pt in college and had a career high. In mins 22 mins and 3pt shooting last year .374% . For a 23 yr old. Only THREE players shot over 40% 3pt shooting in 2024-25 nba season. OK and if Moddys .374% would count he would be the #5 on the list. I think you need to research what 3pt shooting actually means. link to google.com link to basketball-reference.com Research? Have you ever even touched a basketball? And wtf college got to do with the nba? It’s not even the same distance. And you want to talk about research? Haha gtfo and go touch some grass This game is a test for Post. Can he play enough defense to show his value. He will be going against Ayton who is a lob shooter so Post must keep him from getting inside positioning. Post will learn from Horford. His defense and rebounding must be better. Both he and TJD should learn a lot from Horford. Please login to leave a reply. Log in Register Username or Email Address Password Remember Me Register"}

There’s more from Los Angeles: Here is my Lakers roster notes/player quick review (I left out the rookies because too much volatility, too hard to predict): Luka: elite top 5, MVP contender, we all know he’s in his prime too Lebron: very old and very injured. He’s at the point where something like a back injury could end his career. Very low chance of being a meaningful player this season Reaves: maybe the best 2way sign of all-time. Underrated and extremely good Hachimura: the definition of mid. Not a “good” player in this league.

Stats back it up Smart: another massively overrated player. At no point did he ever clear Draymond defensively. The worst, most undeserving DPOY ever. He is a PG for crying out loud. Even in his prime he was barely good. Also made of glass. Glad he isn’t on my team LaRavia: had a decent season last year averaging 20 MPG. Nice buy low option. If he keeps ascending, Lakers might have got a bargain, but he is no sure bet to keep improving, huge year for him tbh Vanderbilt: another absolutely terrible player. Lakers having multiple “worst in the league” contenders on the same roster speaks volumes on their ceiling Hayes: not a terrible role player, but can he be trusted with over 20 MPG? Still developing, I will reserve judgement as he is a breakout candidate Bronny: cmon. “Euro league bench player wins NBA job due to father”. We all know the deal here. Moving on… Knecht: another development piece. Played much worse after trade rumors. Still has a decent ceiling to be a regular rotation piece James sitting out will be a great opportunity for Rui, Vando and LaRavia getting more minutes and more shots. Even Knecht might get some playing time with LeBron out. Hopefully, Bron comes back healthy in a month or two, and the Nove mentioned players will have built up some confidence, which will bode well for the Lakers in the playoffs. What team does better next season, GSW or Lakers? Both are old and seemingly on their last legs on being considered contenders but both donât exactly have strong enough rosters in comparison to some of the other teams in the league. Luka Bron Reaves with help from Smart Vando Rui Ayton or Curry Butler Green with help from Kuminga Heild Horford and what not They both finish with win totals in the high forties and their playoff fates will be hugely health reliant. If either one makes it out of the West it will be because they stayed healthy while other teams suffered key injuries. I wonât be shocked if Curry or LeBron add to their ring totals this yearâ¦and in that coin toss I will pick the Warriors I donât see either team having a chance at winning a chip unless there is a trade or two. Warriors could do that with Kuminga but until that happens then I donât rate their chances. As for the Lakers, I think they have many issues, mainly a lack of defence. Luka Reaves Bron and Ayton donât offer much and when you then have Smart and Vando in there for their defence they offer nothing on offence. They need more two way guys and better cohesion. Rui gets a lot of smack from people but he plays his role perfectly. Over 50% from the field and over 40% on 3, does well on defence and can play either forward spot. “Both are old and seemingly on their last legs of being considered contenders” GSW are old. LAL are not. Other than LeBron, they have only 2 players older than 30 – Smart and Kleber. In a potential Doncic, Reaves, Hachimura, Ayton, Vanderbilt line-up, the oldest player is 27. That line-up has the same average age as Strus, Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, Mobley, Garland team. Carmelo, Russ, Dwight, Rondo, Ariza, DeAndre Jordan are not in Los Angeles anymore. That team was old in 2022. 25-26 Lakers are not. If Lakers meets the Warriors, i’d favor the Lakers. Luka is only 26 and is now in basketball shape. Warriors does not have the length that the wolves have. It will be a challenge for them to contain him like the wolves did. The Lakers are the 6 th youngest team outside of Lebron , 11th if you count him They have 1 player other than lebron over 30 Smart (31) that will see the floor for more than double digit mins per game this year Itâs not even a lazy take itâs just flat out incorrect . You didnât think this one out very well Not a good sign to load manage Luka already. Maybe an injury prone player shouldn’t beat himself up just weeks before the NBA season. The best thing the Lakers can do is trade Lebron. They won’t, but they need to. Smart, Luka, Reaves, Rui and Ayton could be a good lineup if everyone is running the floor. LeBron has a no-trade clause. It’s one of the reasons he was always signing 1+1 with a player option. He’s not approving any trade. He wants to have a never-traded label. Well they messed that up big time Peter, he wants to have a ânever tradedâ label until it comes to money. To get money from his desired team, he had to be traded there. He could not just sign with the Heat outright. It wouldâve hurt his wallet so I guess he didnât want the never traded label that bad. Itâs like everyone talking about Jonathan Kumingaâs recent âprinciples.â While his principles meant taking 8 million, but taking the money meant 50 million. Jebron Lames!

Which teams' big threes are on the rise, and which need work? ESPN's Tim Bontemps breaks it down in 10 tiers.", "body": "Iman Shumpert is looking forward to seeing how the Thunder respond after winning the NBA title. (0:46) The NBA might be in its depth era, but star power still wins the day. In a sport in which only five players take the floor for each team at a time, a concentration of stars has been a clear way to build a championship-level team. But even when a team doesn't have a trio of ready-made stars, looking at the top three players on each roster is a good way to measure both the short- and long-term health of an organization and where a franchise is headed over the next few months and next few years. With that rubric in mind, we not only have laid out the cores of all 30 NBA teams , but also ranked them in comparison to one another. And we've done so by taking into account both the group's present and future value -- along with the likelihood that these players will be with their respective teams for the medium to long term. Jump to a tier: A league of their own | Knocking on the door Best of the East | Ascendant young teams Gap Years | Old stars with big questions Changing the course | Stuck in the middle Starting a rebuild | Rebuilding Oklahoma City Thunder : Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Chet Holmgren , Jalen Williams Who else could be atop this list? Not only did the Thunder win 68 games and their first championship last season, but they also did so with one of the youngest title-winning rosters in NBA history. Then, to cap things off, general manager Sam Presti went out this summer and proceeded to lock all three of his young cornerstones into long-term contract extensions -- officially cementing the Thunder as the perennial favorites to lift the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the foreseeable future. Last year: Gilgeous-Alexander, Holmgren, Williams Denver Nuggets : Aaron Gordon , Nikola Jokic , Jamal Murray Denver is a pair of rough Western Conference semifinal Game 7s -- blowing a 20-point lead at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves two years ago before playing with an injured Gordon against the Thunder last season -- from having a potential chance at ripping off three straight titles. Denver still has the best player in the sport in Nikola Jokic, though, and a pair of co-stars who fit extremely well alongside him in Murray and Gordon. They both have delivered repeatedly in huge playoff moments. Last year: Gordon, Jokic, Murray The \"NBA Today\" crew discusses a preseason poll naming Nikola Jokic the best player in the NBA. Cleveland Cavaliers : Darius Garland , Donovan Mitchell , Evan Mobley The Cavaliers, like the Thunder, have a trio of prime-age or younger stars locked into long-term contracts and a team that won 64 games last season. Unlike the Thunder, however, Cleveland was unable to follow it with playoff success, losing in five games to the Indiana Pacers in the second round. That is why the Cavaliers are placed here and not even higher up this list. A strong playoff run next spring, and that will quickly change. Last year: Garland, Mitchell, Mobley New York Knicks : OG Anunoby , Jalen Brunson , Karl-Anthony Towns New York enters the season having moved on from coach Tom Thibodeau after reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years -- a clear indication that the Knicks believe this group is good enough to finally snap a half-century championship drought. Brunson and Towns are two of the best offensive point guards and centers, respectively, in the league, while Anunoby is as good as any defender on the wing on top of becoming an excellent 3-point shooter, too. Last year: Anunoby, Brunson, Towns Atlanta Hawks : Dyson Daniels , Jalen Johnson , Zaccharie Risacher For the second straight season, the Hawks have the same trio leading the way, all while the franchise has undergone a rapid and fascinating reimagining of the roster by newly installed general manager Onsi Saleh. Trae Young remains this team's best player. Kristaps Porzingis could be its second. And yet, both players are able to be unrestricted free agents next summer. Meanwhile Daniels was last season's Most Improved Player, Johnson -- if he can stay healthy -- is a popular breakout candidate and Risacher, although no Cooper Flagg or Victor Wembanyama , had a fine rookie season after Atlanta selected him No. 1 in the 2024 draft. Last year: Daniels, Johnson, Risacher Detroit Pistons : Cade Cunningham , Ron Holland , Ausar Thompson A year ago, there were massive questions about the Pistons' roster. They began with Cunningham, and whether he was capable of being the kind of star leader a franchise needs to become a factor in the playoffs. Cunningham responded with a brilliant campaign, earning All-Star and All-NBA honors for the first time while leading Detroit back to the playoffs for the first time since 2019. Questions remain about the rest of the roster, but there are several intriguing young players such as Holland, Thompson, Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren , who could all fill the remaining core spots around Cunningham. Last year: Cunningham, Holland, Ivey Houston Rockets : Alperen Sengun , Reed Sheppard , Amen Thompson A lot has changed in Houston over the past year. Thompson was a very near miss from inclusion in this group a year ago, and in hindsight that was an obvious mistake. The No. 4 pick in the 2023 NBA draft continues to blossom into a star and has a chance to take another massive leap forward this season due to the unfortunate torn ACL for Fred VanVleet last month during preseason workouts. Although I'm sure you're thinking, \"No Kevin Durant ? Really ?\" remember the purpose of this list. Durant remains -- at least for now -- without a contract extension, and Sheppard could be the team's starting point guard this season and remains a key player for Houston long term. Last year: Sengun, Sheppard, VanVleet Kendrick Perkins breaks down his optimism for the Rockets' offense after an impressive performance vs. the Jazz. Minnesota Timberwolves: Anthony Edwards , Jaden McDaniels , Julius Randle After advancing out of the first round of the playoffs once in its first 34 years of existence, Minnesota has now done so in back-to-back seasons, reaching the Western Conference finals before losing to the Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma City Thunder , respectively. The question now is how Minnesota will find a way to advance further -- especially with the Thunder looming over the West moving forward. The answer will begin with continued improvement from Edwards and McDaniels. Randle moves into the core after inking a long-term extension with the franchise this offseason. Last year: Edwards, McDaniels, Rudy Gobert Orlando Magic : Paolo Banchero , Desmond Bane , Franz Wagner Orlando's season going sideways last year when Jalen Suggs suffered a knee injury is a sign of just how important he is -- despite the fact that he, unlike Banchero and Wagner, is not on a max contract. But Orlando paid a king's ransom to land Bane -- a perfect complement to its three young homegrown players -- this summer, and Suggs is still sidelined with the knee injury, so Bane moves into the core for this group. The Magic's season will likely hinge on whether Banchero and Wagner can make improvements in their efficiency this season -- which, if they can, could lead to huge success in a wide-open East. Last year: Banchero, Suggs, Wagner San Antonio Spurs : De'Aaron Fox , Dylan Harper , Victor Wembanyama How do you get picked fourth and win Rookie of the Year, as Stephon Castle did last season, and fall out of a team's core? By that same team trading for an All-Star point guard (Fox) and drafting another (Harper) with the second pick after jumping up in the lottery, as the Spurs did over the past few months. How all of these different players fit around the one certain core player in San Antonio for the foreseeable future, Wembanyama, will be one of the big stories of the upcoming NBA season . Last year: Wembanyama, Castle, Devin Vassell Boston Celtics : Jaylen Brown , Jayson Tatum , Derrick White A year ago, Boston was coming off raising banner No. 18 to the TD Garden rafters and looked poised to have a real chance at claiming a 19th title. Then came Tatum's unfortunate torn Achilles in May against the Knicks in the conference semifinals. Now, Boston is likely to spend this season spinning its wheels waiting for Tatum to get back and give this group a chance to potentially be back in the title fight again in 2026-27. Until then, though, Brown and White will still remain two of the better wing players in the NBA, and the envy of most of the opponents they'll come up against this season. Last year: Brown, Tatum, White Jayson Tatum tells Stephen A. Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. Indiana Pacers : Tyrese Haliburton , Andrew Nembhard , Pascal Siakam Entering Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Indiana was likely going to be right near the top of this list after a remarkable playoff run that featured a series of historic comebacks fueled by the style of play coach Rick Carlisle and Haliburton have employed in Indianapolis. But after Haliburton suffered an Achilles tear in that final game of the 2024-25 campaign, the Pacers are also staring at a long 12 months until his likely return at the start of next season. One silver lining? Although Bennedict Mathurin fell out of the team's core thanks to the emergence of Nembhard, who had another brilliant playoff run, Haliburton's absence could give the former lottery pick a chance to reestablish himself with the Pacers. Last year: Haliburton, Siakam, Mathurin Dallas Mavericks: Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg, Kyrie Irving Things are drastically different in Dallas compared to a year ago, when the Mavericks had Luka Doncic and Irving together in a backcourt that was coming off an NBA Finals appearance. Now, Irving has a torn ACL, Doncic is in Los Angeles and -- after a stunning bit of lottery luck -- Flagg is the star of the show, playing alongside Davis in the Mavericks' frontcourt. It's all pretty hard to believe, even months after it all took place. Still, Dallas could have a chance to be a factor this season -- but that will require Flagg to instantly contribute, Davis to remain healthy and Irving to come back from his knee injury ready to go by playoff time. Last year: Irving, Doncic, Dereck Lively Golden State Warriors : Jimmy Butler , Stephen Curry , Draymond Green Last season, the Warriors went 22-5 with Butler and Curry both available after acquiring Butler at the trade deadline from the Miami Heat , and they feel they'd have advanced to the Western Conference finals if they hadn't lost Curry for the rest of the series against the Minnesota Timberwolves with a hamstring injury. There's little doubt this team has a very high ceiling -- if healthy. But given their core is all 35 or older, the \"if healthy\" question is going to follow this group around all season long. Last year: Curry, Green, Brandin Podziemski LA Clippers : James Harden , Kawhi Leonard , Ivica Zubac The Clippers had a very productive offseason, going out and landing John Collins , Brook Lopez , Bradley Beal and Chris Paul , and should get strong seasons from both Harden and Zubac. Questions about Leonard -- both on and off the court -- hang over this team like a lead balloon, however. Can Leonard, who has missed just over 40% of the possible games he could've played for the Clippers over the past six seasons, and played just 37 last season, stay healthy? And, with the investigation into potential cap circumvention ongoing, will that cause any issues for him and the Clippers? Only time will tell on both fronts. Last year: Harden, Leonard, Zubac Los Angeles Lakers : Luka Doncic , LeBron James , Austin Reaves The Lakers -- fairly -- believe a team led by Doncic and James can contend with anyone. However, that requires both players to be healthy. And with James already dealing with a sciatica problem that threatens the start of his season for the first time in his remarkable career -- plus his status as the league's oldest player, who is approaching his 41st birthday -- health is going to be a constant question. And that's before the potential shooting issues, as well as the perimeter and interior defensive concerns for this team. Last year: James, Reaves, Anthony Davis Milwaukee Bucks : Giannis Antetokounmpo , Bobby Portis , Myles Turner As ESPN's Shams Charania reported last week , Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee is a much-discussed -- and planned-for -- topic around the NBA. But as the season approaches, he remains a Buck, and he should be an MVP candidate this season if he remains healthy given how much he's going to have the ball in his hands. Although Turner slots in for Brook Lopez as the floor-spacing center in the core, the drop-off from Damian Lillard -- now back in Portland -- to Portis (or Kyle Kuzma or AJ Green or whomever you choose for the third person to be) is massive and shows why it could be a challenging year in Milwaukee, even with a healthy Antetokounmpo terrorizing opponents. Last year: Antetokounmpo, Lillard, Lopez Memphis Grizzlies : Cedric Coward , Jaren Jackson Jr ., Ja Morant Here's all you need to know about the state of things in Memphis: Jackson is recovering from offseason surgery; Morant is now likely to miss the start of the season with an ankle sprain ; Zach Edey is also recovering from offseason surgery; and both Jaylen Wells , No. 3 in last season's Rookie of the Year balloting, and Coward, whom Memphis leapt up in the draft to take at No. 11 this past June, ended last season hurt. The Desmond Bane trade reconstituted the Grizzlies' roster -- Memphis subsequently placed a big bet on Coward -- but this team can still go only as far as Morant and Jackson can take it. This is also another reminder of how fast things can change in the NBA, as it wasn't long ago that Morant-Jackson-Bane was seen as one of the elite, young cornerstone foundations in the league. Last year: Morant, Jackson, Bane Philadelphia 76ers : VJ Edgecombe , Joel Embiid , Tyrese Maxey Questions? In Philadelphia? Never! Jokes aside, obviously the elephant in the room is the health of Embiid, let alone that of Paul George . If the two of them can stay on the court this season, Philadelphia could be a factor in the East. But there's no certainty of when, or how often, we will see the two 76ers stars out there. George, meanwhile, is in the second year of a max extension that he signed as a free agent last summer, but he falls out of the core this season in favor of Edgecombe, the third pick in June's draft. Last year: Embiid, Maxey, George Shams Charania joins \"The Pat McAfee Show\" to discuss Erik Spoelstra being named the head coach for Team USA men's basketball. Chicago Bulls : Matas Buzelis , Noa Essengue , Josh Giddey This is a franchise perpetually stuck in the mud. One could argue the Bulls should be in a lower tier than this -- but that would be saying the Bulls are definitely going to be committed to bottoming out and rebuilding. History suggests they will win 38 or 39 games and be in the play-in -- which, in this season's East, is very possible. After signing a long-term deal this offseason , Giddey is a core player. Coby White , although the team's best player, is not as he enters the season on an expiring deal. Instead, the No. 12 pick in this year's draft, Essengue, is one alongside Buzelis, last year's No. 11 pick. Last year: Giddey, White, Patrick Williams Miami Heat: Bam Adebayo , Tyler Herro , Kel'el Ware The Heat are not a team accustomed to being stuck anywhere, but that's where they seem to be after yet another play-in finish last season. With Butler now having decamped to Golden State, the Heat are officially on the hunt for their next long-term star to pair with Adebayo. Perhaps that player is Herro, if he can make another big leap after a great season earned him his first All-Star berth. Ware, too, has a lot of promise as a super-active, long defensive big. But this team needs more if it's going to leap out of the doldrums -- even in the East. Last year: Adebayo, Herro, Jimmy Butler Sacramento Kings : Zach LaVine , Keegan Murray , Domantas Sabonis The seven-game series against the Warriors in the first round of the 2023 playoffs feels like a decade ago now. De'Aaron Fox is now in San Antonio, Mike Brown is now in New York, and the Kings have morphed into a bizarro version of the Chicago Bulls with LaVine and DeMar DeRozan back together again. Murray is likely to get an extension done with Sacramento in the coming days, but he's the one long-term bright spot on this roster despite missing the first several weeks of the upcoming season with a thumb injury. The rest? Either in their prime or aging out of it, and it's unclear what path this team will take from here. Last year: Murray, Sabonis, Fox Toronto Raptors : Scottie Barnes , Brandon Ingram , Collin Murray-Boyles Barnes was guaranteed to be a part of this core after agreeing to a massive max contract extension, but who would be alongside him? It turns out, it's last season's big trade deadline acquisition, Ingram, and Toronto's big offseason acquisition, Murray-Boyles, the No. 9 pick in June's NBA draft. Still, it's hard to see the long-term upside of this group to be anything more than what the tail end of the previous Raptors playoff team was: one good enough to make it and lose in a competitive first-round series. Last year: Barnes, Gradey Dick , Immanuel Quickley Charlotte Hornets : LaMelo Ball , Kon Knueppel , Brandon Miller The Hornets, now in their second full season under general manager Jeff Peterson and coach Charles Lee, will hope to see their collection of interesting young talent on the court far more often this season, after a number of injuries -- including to Ball and Miller -- precluded it last season. What the injury woes did do, however, was give the Hornets the chance to land Knueppel with the fourth pick in June's draft. He should be a perfect complement alongside Ball and Miller on the wings. The questions, though, are inside, where Charlotte is back to square one after sending Mark Williams , a core member last season, to Phoenix in June after the failed trade to the Lakers back in February. Last year: Ball, Miller, Williams New Orleans Pelicans : Jeremiah Fears , Derik Queen , Zion Williamson Williamson showed up for training camp in great shape for New Orleans, and the Pelicans hope that finally translates into sustained health and high-level play from him this season. But although Dejounte Murray and Trey Murphy remain in New Orleans, the man who traded for Murray and drafted and extended Murphy -- David Griffin -- is not. So, instead, the two lottery picks from the new front office, Fears and Queen, become core members for the Pelicans going forward. Queen will be fascinating to watch given all the attention around the trade the Pelicans made to acquire him, which included giving up an unprotected pick in next year's loaded draft to Atlanta. Last year: Williamson, Murray, Murphy Phoenix Suns : Devin Booker , Ryan Dunn , Khaman Maluach What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time, the Suns had a wildly expensive roster built around three big stars -- Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. Now, Durant and Beal are gone, Booker remains, and the Suns -- who have dead money on their books for the rest of the decade and none of their own draft picks under their control for the same time period -- are starting a rebuild. There are some interesting young players, led by Dunn and Maluach, but it's going to take time for Phoenix to turn this around -- and the Suns are going to need to show more patience than they have at any point since Mat Ishbia bought the team two-plus years ago. Last year: Booker, Beal, Durant Brooklyn Nets : Nic Claxton , Egor Demin , Nolan Traore If you need any hint to the direction of the Nets, look no further than June's NBA draft, when Brooklyn had five first-round picks -- and kept all of them, drafting Demin, Traore, guards Drake Powell and Ben Saraf , and big man Danny Wolf . They, along with Noah Clowney , a first-round pick two years ago, are the future in Brooklyn -- along with whomever the Nets land in the 2026 draft. Claxton remains a core member because he's on a long-term deal and, given he's in his mid-20s, should still be able to rediscover his prior form. Cam Thomas , on the other hand, is not, after he signed the one-year qualifying offer this offseason. Last year: Claxton, Clowney, Thomas Portland Trail Blazers : Toumani Camara , Donovan Clingan , Shaedon Sharpe There are few teams harder to parse in terms of their direction than Portland. The Blazers have a roster full of interesting young talents, such as Clingan, Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Yang Hansen . But then they went out this offseason and traded for Jrue Holiday and re-signed Lillard, who won't play all season. Will Jerami Grant start? Will Henderson when he comes back from a hamstring injury? Where does Deni Advija, who was arguably the team's best player last year, fit in the starting five - or does he? There's just so much noise here that it's hard to know exactly what Portland's goals are -- which will make for a very fascinating season. Last year: Clingan, Henderson, Sharpe Utah Jazz : Ace Bailey , Walter Clayton , Lauri Markkanen The Jazz, once again, kept the dubious distinction of having never moved up once in the NBA's draft lottery, causing them to land the fifth pick after having the league's worst record. Still, they wound up drafting Bailey, who spent all season as a consensus top-three selection, as the first move of Austin Ainge's tenure as the team's president of basketball operations. He quickly followed it up by landing Clayton, the national championship-winning point guard, with the No. 18 pick to make him a core player, as well. Walker Kessler , without a contract extension, isn't one, and Markkanen will look to get back to the form he showed two years ago. Last year: Markkanen, Keyonte George , Kessler Washington Wizards : Bilal Coulibaly , Tre Johnson , Alex Sarr Another team that had its high lottery hopes dashed in the lottery, the Wizards are once again committed to playing and developing their young talent. That's why Coulibaly, Sarr and Johnson -- their top picks in each of the past three drafts, respectively -- remain the top three players in Washington's core. This season, though, will be about continuing to see who can emerge from the many young players the Wizards have assembled, as they're now up to 10 players on first-round rookie contracts on their roster. Last year: Coulibaly, Sarr, Bub Carrington"}

(0:42) The NBA vetted and approved a $300 million sponsorship deal between the LA Clippers and Aspiration in 2021, months before the green banking company signed a separate deal with star Kawhi Leonard that has triggered a salary cap-circumvention investigation by the league, multiple sources told ESPN. Two sources with direct knowledge of the arrangement said the Clippers submitted the 23-year agreement to the NBA for approval before it was announced in September 2021, as required under league rules because it contained a jersey patch component, the sources said. The agreement also included signage in the team's yet-to-be-completed arena in Inglewood, the sources said. In April 2022, Aspiration reportedly signed a separate, $28 million sponsorship deal with Leonard that was not subject to NBA review, per the league's collective bargaining agreement. The NBA is investigating whether the Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer violated league rules by circumventing the salary cap to compensate Leonard. Following reports of the allegations, NBA commissioner Adam Silver initially said he had \"never heard of the company Aspiration before,\" then later revised his comments to say he was \"aware of the brand.\" The NBA does not require teams to submit all sponsorship agreements for review. But some types of sponsorships, including jersey patches and signage that is viewable on television broadcasts, are subject to heightened rules or approval by the league. Sponsorships with companies tied to cannabis, gaming and energy drinks are also subject to league review. \"Teams vet their own sponsorship partners and negotiate their own sponsorship agreements,\" NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said in a statement to ESPN. \"Given the jersey patch's inclusion on player jerseys and its level of exposure across game telecasts, the league reviews and approves jersey patch arrangements pursuant to league rules that are intended to avoid potential brand issues or conflicts with league partnerships.\" A Clippers spokesperson referred questions about the league's process to the NBA. A sponsorship deal for a team's jersey patch requires explicit approval of the NBA, according to official league documents obtained by ESPN. The 2021-22 league operations manual specifies that a team \"must notify, and obtain the approval of, the NBA\" before entering into such an arrangement and that \"a team cannot announce any Patch arrangement unless the applicable Patch Sponsorship Agreement, Jersey Patch and announcement have been approved in advance by the NBA.\" The manual devotes roughly four pages to policies regarding patch sponsorship arrangements. It states that teams must submit such terms to the NBA in advance of any announcement. The manual even dictates a patch's size and location on the uniform, stating, \"The dimensions of the Jersey Patch may be adjusted slightly, as approved by the NBA.\" The manual also specifies provisions that must be included in a contract between a team and patch sponsor. One of those provisions states that the league or the team can terminate the deal if the sponsor \"becomes involved in any controversy or scandal that has or may have a negative effect on the business, reputation or the public's perception of [the team] or the NBA.\" In September 2021, the same month that the Clippers announced their deal with Aspiration , Ballmer invested $50 million in the California-based company, according to podcaster and journalist Pablo Torre. In April 2022, Aspiration reached a four-year, $28 million endorsement deal with Leonard, an agreement that an unnamed employee who purportedly worked for the banking company told Torre \"was to circumvent the salary cap.\" In an interview with ESPN , Ballmer denied that he had knowledge of the endorsement contract that Aspiration eventually signed with Leonard or that he directed the company to do so. NBA rules do not prohibit teams from introducing team sponsors or companies to players, but teams aren't allowed to be involved in subsequent negotiations. Per the collective bargaining agreement, the league does not review sponsorship deals with players. The Aspiration logo was scheduled to be on the Clippers' jerseys at the start of the 2023-24 season after the team's deal with Honey expired, but it didn't appear. In January 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Aspiration was the subject of a Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation into whether the company misled customers. At the time, the Clippers told Bloomberg that the team had terminated its sponsorship agreement with Aspiration \"last season.\" Aspiration filed for bankruptcy this March with a reported debt of $170 million. The company said at the time that it owed the Clippers $30 million, the most of all its creditors. In August, Aspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors said Sanberg defrauded investors and lenders out of $248 million by fraudulently obtaining loans, falsifying bank and brokerage statements, and concealing that he was the source of some revenue booked by the company. Ballmer told ESPN that he had been reviewing his interaction with Aspiration as part of his and the team's cooperation with the DOJ investigation into the company. \"These were guys who committed fraud,\" he said. \"Look, they conned me. They conned me. I made an investment in these guys thinking it was on the up-and-up, and they conned me at this stage.\" Multiple sources familiar with the league's sponsorship-vetting process said the review centers on the credibility of the company and its ability to deliver on its financial commitments. It's unclear whether the league conducted any further reviews of the Clippers-Aspiration agreement after approving the initial deal. The league has hired law firm Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate whether the Clippers circumvented salary cap rules. People familiar with the process suggested the probe could take months, perhaps not concluding until after the 2026 NBA playoffs. But those same people also noted that, per the terms of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, Silver is not solely responsible for deciding whether the Clippers will be punished, depending on the findings. Rather, Wachtell Lipton will present its findings to the league office, and Silver will have to decide, based on those findings -- or lack thereof -- whether to bring any potential evidence to a neutral arbitrator appointed by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, the people said. The arbitrator would then examine what Silver brought forth and decide the next step. The arbitrator could either grant Silver the authority to punish the Clippers or decide that there isn't enough evidence to merit any discipline and deny him the ability to levy penalties against the team. \"The burden is on the league if we're going to discipline a team, an owner, a player or any constituent members of the league,\" Silver told reporters following the league's board of governors meetings in Midtown Manhattan in mid-September. \"I think as with any process that requires a fundamental sense of fairness, the burden should be on the party that is, in essence, bringing those charges.\""}

Doncic sat out L.A.'s 1-2 start to the preseason, with the Lakers looking to lessen the 26-year-old star's workload coming off his monthlong commitment playing for the Slovenian national team in EuroBasket. After the Suns game, the Lakers finish out their six-game preseason slate with a game in Las Vegas against Doncic's former team, the Dallas Mavericks , on Wednesday and a home game against the Sacramento Kings on Friday. Redick said that Doncic would also play in either the Mavs or Kings game. It stands to reason that the Kings game would be more likely, considering the Mavs game falls on the second night of a back-to-back. Redick said he will work with Doncic's athletic trainer, Javy Barrio, to determine how much Doncic will play, but the Lakers will err on the side of caution in Phoenix. \"I would say there will most likely be a ramp-up from Game 1 to Game 2 in Luka's minutes,\" Redick said. \"What that total number looks like, we're still talking to Javy and Luka about what kind of makes sense.\" When asked how he planned to use Doncic, Redick deadpanned: \"Give him the ball.\" Marcus Smart , who has been out for the first three preseason games because of Achilles tendinopathy, also will make his Lakers debut in Phoenix, according to Redick. The coach added that Austin Reaves will also play against the Suns. With opening night against the Golden State Warriors just more than a week away next Tuesday, Redick said he still has to figure out his starting lineup. LeBron James will be out at least another two to three weeks with sciatica on his right side before being reevaluated. \"You want to put your five best players on the court as much as possible. You also want to have balance with every lineup. When we do our substitution metrics: Who is going to guard? Who is going to create? Are we going to have enough shooting? So you're doing that with every lineup you put out there, including the starting lineup,\" Redick said. \"We're still working through that, and obviously losing LeBron for the start of the year in some ways complicates things a little bit. So, we have a week to figure that out, and I think it will reveal itself to us.\""}

Murray had surgery Monday and will be reevaluated in four to six weeks, ruling the Kings' young power forward out for at least the first 10 games of the regular season. The injury comes at a pivotal time in Murray's career. Entering his fourth season, he is eligible for a contract extension in the next week. The deadline to come to an agreement with the Kings is Oct. 20. If they can't, Murray will enter restricted free agency next summer. Murray has been a pillar of durability early in his NBA career, appearing in 233 of a possible 246 games his first three seasons, starting all but two of them. This UCL tear is the most significant injury he has suffered as a pro. Murray was the projected starting power forward for a Kings team attempting to compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. He has made 543 career 3s and developed into a versatile defender on the wing, meaning the Kings will be without a crucial floor spacer and their most trusted stopper in the opening month. Veteran forward Dario Saric , veteran guard Malik Monk , fourth-year guard Keon Ellis and rookie Nique Clifford are among the candidates who could start in Murray's place. Dennis Schroder , Zach LaVine , DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis are the four other expected starters."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might have made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4-of-5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. He played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he would feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter by running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up, and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

(1:01) A decade after winning the first of four titles to start a dynasty, the Golden State Warriors have seemingly been passed by the rest of the Western Conference. According to ESPN BET , the Warriors have just the seventh-best odds to win the West this season, behind the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder , Denver Nuggets , Houston Rockets , Los Angeles Lakers , Minnesota Timberwolves and LA Clippers . That placement makes some sense. Golden State was the No. 7 seed last season, bowed out in five games in the second round and could boast the oldest starting lineup in NBA history this season. If Buddy Hield joins Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler III , Draymond Green and Al Horford in the starting lineup after Hield's birthday on Dec. 17, the Warriors would be the first team to start five players 33 or older in a game, according to ESPN Research. But that quick, pessimistic summary severely underrates Golden State's potential. In contrast, the Warriors profile as one of the most dangerous teams in the West, even in their dotage, and they might even be able to compete with the omnipotent Thunder. The NBA's last repeat champion could be a sleeper that stops the newest candidate from repeating. Projections from ESPN's Kevin Pelton place the Warriors second in the entire NBA, with a forecast of 56 wins -- closer to the top of the West than to the play-in portion of the standings. What explains the discrepancy between that projection and the general perception that the Warriors' window has closed? Here's the simple explanation: In half a season with Butler, the Warriors were one of the best teams in the league, and they improved in the offseason. By that logic, they should be a contender again this season. Golden State upset the second-seeded Rockets in the first round and took Game 1 against the Timberwolves before running out of steam without Curry, who suffered a hamstring strain 13 minutes into the series. There's no shame in losing that way, as any contender would expect to struggle without its best player. Don't let the 2024-25 Warriors' meek playoff exit mask their remarkable in-season turnaround, though. Before the Butler trade, Golden State was 25-26 with a minus-0.4 net rating. But from Butler's debut through the end of the regular season, it ranked first in defensive rating and third in net, at plus-9.2 per 100 possessions. The team's 23-8 record in that span -- which extrapolates to 61 wins over a full season -- wasn't a fluke. With Curry back and Butler on board for a full season, there's no reason to think Golden State will be any worse this season. The Warriors should benefit from incredible continuity. Twelve of their top 13 players in 2024-25 postseason minutes will return in 2025-26, and they upgraded on the one departure ( Kevon Looney ) with Horford, who left the Boston Celtics in free agency. Horford's arrival in Golden State is crucial , as Curry has never played with a big man like the 39-year-old NBA champion before. Among Warriors centers since Curry's breakout season (2012-13), the leaders in total 3-point makes are Dario Saric , who made 74 3s as a backup center in 2023-24, and Quinten Post , who sank 73 as a rookie last season. By comparison, Horford has made triple-digit 3s in each of the past three seasons, and his 40.9% 3-point mark over that span is the best among all centers with at least 100 makes, narrowly ahead of Karl-Anthony Towns' 40.8%. His ability to stretch the floor will provide important balance next to Butler and Green, who can both be reluctant shooters. Horford is also a far superior defender and creator to Saric and Post, making him a better all-around fit for the Warriors' lineup. There is tremendous defensive potential in a frontcourt featuring Butler, Green and Horford, who have a combined 15 All-Defensive Team appearances in their careers. A strong defense, after all, is just as central to the Warriors' winning identity as Curry's deep 3s. In 2021-22, their last title season, the Warriors finished second in defensive rating versus just 16th on offense. And last year, Golden State led the league in defensive rating after Butler's arrival -- even without Horford, and even with their opponents making an unsustainably high percentage of their 3-point tries. Golden State should also be better on the other end this season. In 2024-25, the offense hummed as long as Curry was on the floor but fell apart when he rested; lineups without Curry or Butler placed in just the 5th percentile in offensive rating, per Cleaning the Glass. Butler stabilized those groups, though, and the Warriors ended up looking solid as long as one of those stars was on the floor. Age and availability could get in the way of that plan. Curry has missed an average of 15 games per season since sitting out nearly all of 2019-20, while Butler hasn't reached the 65-game threshold for NBA awards since 2018-19. The Warriors will likely struggle once again when Curry goes to the bench in games that Butler misses. Jonathan Kuminga , who is still a Warrior for now after a protracted restricted free agency , could play an important role as the best scoring option in no-Curry, no-Butler minutes; he averaged 24.3 points on 55% shooting in the Warriors' final four playoff games last season. Or Kuminga could improve the team by helping to facilitate a midseason trade. Kuminga is the only Warriors player with a cap hit between $12 million and $25 million this season, meaning he'd provide the necessary matching salary to get Golden State another sizable deal at the deadline. For now, though, it's unclear at what position the Warriors would need to improve. As the season approaches, they're operating with an enviable combination of star power and depth. Five different Warriors -- Curry, Butler, Green, Horford and Brandin Podziemski -- rank among the top 10% most impactful players in the league on a per-possession basis, according to the advanced stat xRAPM, which blends play-by-play and on/off data. The only other teams with more than three such players are the Thunder, Rockets and Cleveland Cavaliers . And behind that quintet, the Warriors have a mishmash of role players on the perimeter -- Hield, Kuminga, Gary Payton II , Moses Moody , De'Anthony Melton -- with various strengths, plus Post and Trayce Jackson-Davis to offer different looks as bigs off the bench. As Pelton notes about his projections, the Warriors \"have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team.\" Ultimately, the Warriors' greatest problem might not be anything about their roster specifically, but rather the context around them: The top of the West is much better than it was in 2022, when Golden State beat the injury-ravaged Nuggets, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks en route to the Finals. But even with that change, there are still major concerns for every team in the conference behind Oklahoma City and Denver. Fred VanVleet 's ACL tear should lower Houston's ceiling, perhaps by a considerable amount. Minnesota is relying on a number of rapidly aging veterans (38-year-old Mike Conley and 33-year-old Rudy Gobert ) and unproven youngsters ( Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr .) to support Anthony Edwards . The Lakers have a thin rotation and a potentially disastrous defense, and they're already dealing with a LeBron James injury. The Clippers face the same age questions as the Warriors, plus the possible ramifications of the Kawhi Leonard /Aspiration investigation . Even the Thunder, who don't even have any minor concerns, let alone major ones, could struggle to dispatch Golden State in a potential playoff matchup. The Warriors have consistently played this version of the Thunder tough. Over the last two seasons, Golden State is 3-4 against Oklahoma City; two of those losses came in overtime, and Curry didn't play in the other two. Butler wasn't on the roster for any of those contests. The Warriors wouldn't ever be favored to knock off the Thunder, of course, and they would need to navigate a minefield -- one of talented competition and their own age hurdles -- to get the chance. But it's not an entirely unrealistic proposition, and at this stage in their competitive timeline, a chance is all the Warriors can ask for. With James Wiseman gone and Kuminga halfway out the door, the Warriors' \"two timelines\" plan has been scuttled. It's all about the present timeline now, and maximizing Curry's remaining opportunities to add to his trophy case."}

Here are potential surprises for each team for fantasy purposes. Will some/most/few of these things occur? Johnson might have gotten to that level last season if not for the shoulder injury that shut him down in January. Johnson can be a 20/10 player with more than a block, steal and 3-pointer per game. Who does that? Not many players. If he gets hurt again, we must reevaluate. Brown averaged 26.6 PPG several seasons ago, but now that PF/SF Jayson Tatum is out for much of the season, he needs to score more. SG/PG Derrick White might be the better value coming two rounds later, but Brown will see a career-best in shots. Tatum (Achilles) makes his season debut in March. Stash him if you have an injured list slot, but not for the bench in redraft formats. Create or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today! Sign up today! Demin, 19, played a season for BYU, and while he didn't shoot particularly well or score as much as many expected, he is a gifted passer and, at 6-foot-9, he rebounds well. There will be triple-doubles in his future. The Nets have a few scorers. Demin, despite his rookie status, will end up on fantasy rosters this season. He might be the No. 2 rookie for fantasy, too. The numbers are always terrific, except for one: Ball has performed in only 105 games over the past three seasons. He had offseason surgery on his wrist and ankle. Perhaps that fixes everything, but at least Joel Embiid has played in 60-plus games four times. Ball did it once. The Hornets are bad, which means there is a likelihood of them sitting good players after the All-Star break to tank for the draft, too. Vucevic averages 18 and 10 every season with 3-pointers and solid shooting, and finally his ADP reflects his value -- to a point. Going in the top 30 might be the highest ADP for him in a while. Perhaps that is a fair tradeoff for someone about to turn 35, but he finished last season No. 8 on the Player Rater. Ignore his defense and love the fantasy numbers. Yes, we should predict this every season until he does it. He's only 24 and still improving. Moving on. This one is cheating a bit, because nobody thinks Flagg will produce bigger numbers than C/PF Anthony Davis . He should play more, though. Davis has reached 65 games in one of the past seven seasons, and there is no reason to push him with fellow bigs Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II on the roster. Investing in Davis can be perilous for the impatient. Wonderful player, but brittle. Flagg averages 17 and 7, shoots well, and there is little reason to think he can't suit up at least 75 times. Johnson comes over in trade for Michael Porter Jr. , and while he can't possibly maintain the shooting volume he did in Brooklyn, the shots he sees should be better thanks to the passing skills of C Nikola Jokic . Johnson seems a bit too downgraded in drafts. He can still average 18 PPG. Amen Thompson , the twin brother who plays for the Houston Rockets , is the one you covet in fantasy. He scores and boards, with ample steals and blocks. The one on Detroit also goes in the top 100 of ADP, and he too should pile on the steals, but he isn't much of a scorer or shooter. Neither twin has much of an outside shot, either. Butler finished last season 77th on the Player Rater, but this isn't stopping him from being a top-50 pick in ESPN ADP. OK, so what might change for the positive? Well, Butler shouldn't be traded this season, so that's good, but he also hasn't suited up for more than 65 games since the 2016-17 campaign. It's about the playoffs for Butler. His numbers went up a bit with the Warriors last season, but not close to 20 PPG. Do not reach in drafts. That's a lot for a 7-footer who hasn't topped five APG before, but PG Fred VanVleet (knee) is done for the season, there really isn't a pure point guard available and the offense was already going through the team's center anyway. Sacramento Kings C Domantas Sabonis averaged seven APG in two seasons before last year. Sengun has the skills to do so and flirt with being a top-10 roto player as well. He was No. 19 last season. That would make Nembhard, a borderline top-100 selection in current ADP, a potential top-50 option. PG/SG Tyrese Haliburton is out for the year, and it is hard to see PG T.J. McConnell (hamstring), currently injured, seeing his minutes rise so much. Nembhard runs this team for this season and performs well. Harden, 36, surprised many a fantasy manager with his return to excellent statistical performance last season, when only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic topped him on the Player Rater. Why would this season be different? OK, so Harden is older than most, but this is his offense again, and he shouldn't fall to the middle of Round 2 in drafts. These fine numbers are repeatable. What?! Nothing against SGA and Jokic, but it is only natural to expect Doncic, in better shape and more comfortable in this offense, to perform better than he did for the Lakers last season. And he was great for the Lakers. SF/PF LeBron James will have another outstanding season, but Doncic will take over the offense and earn his second scoring title. He might even finish as fantasy's No. 1 player. Pippen started 21 games for last season's Grizzlies, averaging 14.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG and 5.7 APG, with steals, 3-pointers and strong shooting in them. There might not be major statistical upside for him, but PG Ja Morant (ankle) is always hurt, and Pippen is a better passer than newcomer PG Ty Jerome . Pippen is a solid late-round sleeper, and not only in deep formats. Ware put up solid numbers in the second half of last season when he joined the starting lineup, shifting C/PF Bam Adebayo to power forward. Now, Ware gets a nice spike in minutes. This is going to be a top-100 player, but he isn't being drafted as one. Turner, the longtime Pacer who switched allegiances, has been a fantasy fixture in roto formats for the blocked shots, and we like centers who hit 3-pointers and shoot well. We also like centers who rebound more than 6.5 times per game. That should happen now with the Bucks, who have a bit of a stripped-down roster. This nearly occurred last season, but Gobert held on with an unlikely, massive performance in April (19.4 PPG, 13.6 RPG). Otherwise, Reid was the better player in points formats, and since he is younger, more versatile and has the new contract, we should expect more minutes and production, too. Reid can rebound more than he has in the past. He averaged 18.1 PPG and 9.7 RPG as the starting center. This could be the year Gobert falls shy of 10 RPG. Murphy blossomed into a star last season, averaging 21.2 PPG, but there is clearly upside for more. He averaged 25.1 PPG during 13 January games. Murphy hasn't been the most durable option, but he looks like A.C. Green (look him up) compared with overrated PF Zion Williamson when it comes to durability. It's an odd team, with SG/PG Jordan Poole running \"point,\" but Murphy should be the signature player. Many of us are big Hart fans, but there is no way new Knicks coach Mike Brown is playing him 37.6 MPG. Hart led the league in the category last season with Tom Thibodeau relying so much on his starters. Hart already had finger surgery this summer, and his back hurts. Expect something like his 2023-24 numbers, which are fine and valuable, considering his proclivity for rebounding at a position where few do that, but not top-50 worthy. Holmgren seems to be a bargain pick in the fourth round of ESPN ADP, and his third NBA season really should deliver his best numbers yet. Perhaps potential investors are concerned about durability after Holmgren missed 50 games last season with a broken hip and lost his rookie season to a broken foot. He also played in all 82 games in 2023-24. There could be a run at 20 and 10 here, with myriad blocks and a growing number of 3-pointers. Take Holmgren over injured Grizzlies C/PF Jaren Jackson Jr . (toe). • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list This is bold, but Bane comes from Memphis and should see excellent usage, contributing points, rebounds, assists, steals, 3-pointers and solid shooting while taking away some numbers from others. This is nothing against new teammates PF/SF Paolo Banchero and SF/PF Franz Wagner , but it's not as if they are big rebounders or 3-point shooters. Bane is the draft day bargain here. You know what, let's be optimistic that this mountain of unpredictability can suit up enough to satiate fantasy managers and average 28 PPG, 10 RPG and 1.5 BPG. Embiid (knee) isn't promising anyone anything, but he did perform in 66 and 68 games in the two seasons prior to 2023-24, so there is more of a track record for qualifying for league awards than there is for missing more than 62 games again. Take the chance if he somehow slips into the fifth round. That prediction seems like enough to pique the interest of potential investors, because production has rarely been an issue for this 7-footer. Williams averaged 15.3 PPG and 10.2 RPG for last season's Hornets over 44 games, and they couldn't wait to move him elsewhere. A trade to the Lakers failed. Williams is also an attractive fantasy option because he is a center who hits his free throws; he made more than 80% last season. The Suns can feature him. It took Clingan a while to shed the look of a raw rookie last season, but then he delivered 10.3 PPG, 11.7 RPG and 1.7 BPG in seven April contests. Can we expect that production over six months? Perhaps not, but Clingan is a legit 7-2, a huge body and a franchise building block. It wouldn't take much to make him a top-100 overall player. This is more for deeper roto formats because Schroder might not do much else for a fantasy roster, but he always seems to end up with plenty of assists. The Kings started SG/PG/SF Malik Monk 45 times last season, and he averaged 5.6 APG, but Schroder is better suited to run an offense, and Monk is a sixth-man type. Schroder fits the criteria for potential assists at little draft cost along with Utah's Isaiah Collier , Milwaukee's Kevin Porter, Clipper Chris Paul , Portland's Scoot Henderson (this is the year!) and Toronto's Immanuel Quickley . Yeah, PG De'Aaron Fox is still here, and we're not predicting bad things for him, but Castle should get ample opportunity to run the offense and set Fox up for more 3-point shots because his volume was way down last season. Castle isn't much of an outside shooter, but he can run an offense and get to the foul line. His second season should be even better than his first. Poeltl delivered career bests for Toronto last season with 14.5 PPG and 9.6 RPG, and we cannot help but notice that a player who typically hurts fantasy managers with his free throw shooting went from 55.1% to 67.4%. OK, so not exactly Mark Price (look him up) but certainly more palatable. Poeltl is annually a player to target in the sixth or seventh round. Hopefully, he can participate in 70 games. Markkanen is a draft day bargain in ESPN ADP, going outside the top 75 despite delivering huge numbers in his first two Utah campaigns. This isn't a durable player, but few complained in 2022-23 when he averaged 25.6 PPG and 8.6 RPG. He hits 3-pointers and, before last season, field goals. He's hardly too old to return to prior levels. Keeping with this mini-theme, Whitmore never had a chance in Houston, but a big scorer lurks. How about 20 PPG? He might not do much else for fantasy managers with rebounding or passing, but we should have doubts about which Wizards even stick around for 82 games. This team is tanking again. SG/PG CJ McCollum and SF Khris Middleton will be on contenders eventually. Whitmore might produce like Brooklyn's Cam Thomas statistically , except he isn't even being drafted in fantasy. Just give him the ball."}

Ace Bailey , or at least his former representation, seemingly did everything possible to not get drafted by the Utah Jazz . Bailey reportedly had \"preferred\" destinations which may or may not have influenced a few teams that were in position to take him in June's draft. But Utah decided the talent was too great to pass up -- even against the looming threat of Bailey not reporting to camp or just being a general malcontent -- and took him with the No. 5 overall pick. So far, this looks to have been a very smart decision. For starters, there have been nothing but positive reports about Bailey's attitude. Teammate Kyle Anderson has called Bailey's positivity \"infectious,\" while coach Will Hardy has praised the 19-year-old's \"willingness to ask questions\" and ability to \"see the game and learn on the fly.\" With the obvious qualifier that we're talking about preseason basketball , and just two games at that, Bailey has looked extraordinary on the court so far. Over 70 minutes against the Rockets and Spurs , Bailey has put up 45 points on 19-of-29 shooting. Impressive numbers, obviously. But it's the way those shots are coming, within what is clearly a concerted effort on the part of the Jazz to put Bailey in his most optimal scoring positions, that is putting to bed what was one of the universal concerns about his game in college. That concern was that his offense came very hard . Everything was contested. Part of this was because Rutgers, outside of No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , didn't have anyone capable of drawing defensive attention away from Bailey. But it was also a problem that Bailey was so bothered by the pressure he did face. Now, when we say bothered, it doesn't mean he couldn't score against pressure. He could. And he can. Bailey's ability to bail himself out with tough shots was perhaps the biggest feather in his draft cap. But in the NBA , making tough shots off whirling spins into mid-range fades cannot be the first page of your survival guide. Sustained, efficient scoring only happens when you are operating in breathable enough airspace to access consistently clean looks. If you can't cleanly and consistently create that space for yourself, via your own handle (which is something we know Bailey has thus far struggled to do, as evidenced by his alarmingly high turnover rate against pressure in college), then it has to be created for you. And that's what the Jazz are doing for Bailey. Rather than asking him to start from a stationary position and create advantages in isolation, the Jazz are putting Bailey on the move so that by the time he catches the ball he is either already in, or quickly moving toward, open space. From there, he only requires one or two pressure-free dribbles to get right into a clean shot. This approach was on beautiful display in Bailey's preseason debut against the Rockets. 25 points 🔥 11-16 shooting 🔥 Ace Bailey was SUPERB in his preseason debut. pic.twitter.com/mpjXDFjDXR In Game 2, it was more of the same against the Spurs. Ace Bailey is doing exactly what he needs to do to start his pathway to stardom He attacks space off the catch, rises over defenders with solid form and consistency Not sure we could have asked for a better start pic.twitter.com/UHu3NVYUUy What you'll notice is that in all those buckets, only one came out of isolation (and even in that one he got to his spot at the elbow with exquisite efficiency and footwork, requiring just three dribbles punctuated by a luscious spin move). In fact, Bailey has needed just 28 total dribbles to get off his 29 preseason shots so far. You don't have to be a genius to do the math here. That's fewer than one dribble per shot. That is prime Klay Thompson stuff. Bailey isn't the all-time distant threat Thompson is and he's a better athlete, but the common theme between the two is that they're at their best when they're catching balls on the move rather than starting from scratch. Bailey may well evolve as an individual creator (in fact, he almost certainly will), and when he does it should allow him to get to the rim and free-throw line more. Some people are already saying they see a young T-Mac, which is lofty but perhaps not unwarranted. But for now, Bailey is clearly most comfortable as a mid-range scorer on minimal dribbling (a more athletic Rip Hamilton should have everyone in Utah very excited), and it cannot be overstated how smart it is that the Jazz are positioning him in accordance with that talent until the rest of his arsenal comes around. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

In the grand scheme of things, a team's opening night starting lineup doesn't have to be all that important. The starting lineup doesn't play the whole game, after all. And coaches regularly change that lineup as a season progresses for dozens of possible reasons. Who you are on opening night isn't necessarily who you'll be at the end of the season. But there's something symbolic about a team's starting lineup. It may not represent who the team actually is so much as who a team wants to be. It can represent a stylistic declaration. Are we a big team or a small one? Do we emphasize offense or defense? Are we putting our five best players on the floor or the five that fit best together? The season is a months-long process of exploration. By April, the teams that hope to be playing into May and June have hopefully used that process to figure out who they are and what they need to be to win at the highest level. The players you put on the floor to begin the season are your starting point. So with the season fast approaching, let's look at some of the teams that seemingly haven't settled on starting lineups, examine the possibilities, and try to figure out where they should begin the 2025-26 season. New York's broken starting lineup was one of the major topics of the 2025 postseason. From Jan. 1 through the end of the regular season, the five-man unit of Jalen Brunson , Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges , OG Anunoby and Josh Hart allowed nine more points than it scored. The playoffs were worse. By the time Tom Thibodeau accepted defeat, it was too late. The Knicks were already down 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals. He's now out of a job in part because of that lineup's issues. The first four players are seemingly locked in. The question is the Hart spot. The early favorite for it seems to be Mitchell Robinson , who missed most of last season but shined in the playoffs. The appeal is obvious. Robinson covers Towns' limitations as a rim-protector. Playing the two of them together elevates New York's offensive rebounding to where it was in 2023 and 2024, when it was at the top of the league. As Hart was rarely guarded on the perimeter anyway, the notion that playing two bigs would stifle New York's spacing is a tad overblown. The real concern for Robinson is durability. He's played 70 games once in his career and has appeared in just 48 over the past two seasons. If he's playing meaningful minutes with the starters and serving as the center when Towns rests, it's going to be hard to keep him below, say, 26 to 28 minutes per game. If the goal is to get him to April healthy, such a workload seems dangerous. He's never played 28 minutes per game in his career. Part of what facilitated last year's dominant postseason was the fact that he didn't play until the end of February. He just didn't have much time to suffer another injury. It probably isn't realistic to assume he can last six months as a starter. For this reason, a large slice of New York's fandom has advocated an alternative: Deuce McBride. It was a look Thibodeau practically never went to. McBride played only 82 possessions with the other starters last season. There are two reasonable holdups to boosting that figure. The first, and the one Thibodeau was probably most concerned with, is size. Playing two small guards with a center that doesn't protect the rim is potentially quite dangerous on defense. The other is balance. Bringing Hart and Robinson off of the bench forces a total non-shooter and an iffy shooter to play most of their minutes together. That compromises the spacing of bench units. But the benefits are potentially enormous. Offensively, McBride is too talented a shooter for opponents to guard him with a center as they did Hart. That prevents defenses from using three defenders against the Brunson-Towns pick-and-roll, which never quite gained traction last season largely because of Hart. If properly spaced, that's a potentially lethal play. Defensively, while McBride is small, he's a ferocious point-of-attack defender that's eager to get physical. Bridges is not. At this point in his career, he's more comfortable as an off-ball playmaker. Playing the two of them together would therefore pay dividends for Bridges, who has slipped significantly from his former All-Defense form. There's no perfect answer here. Whether it's Robinson or Hart or McBride, every option comes with drawbacks. The best-case scenario for the Knicks would probably be to mix and match. Mike Brown has 82 games to see how all three versions of the starting lineup work and how each starting lineup affects the bench units that would be attached to them. That was Thibodeau's biggest failing in New York. We don't know the right answer today. We just need to figure it out by April. If Fred VanVleet were healthy, there'd be nothing to talk about here. He'd be starting alongside Amen Thompson , Kevin Durant , Jabari Smith and Alperen Sengun . Now that he isn't, the Rockets have some soul-searching to do. Ime Udoka barely used Reed Sheppard last season. Rafael Stone's front office took steps to ensure that he'd have to this year. Sheppard, VanVleet and Aaron Holiday are the only real guards on the team. But jumping from \"barely plays\" to \"starting on a team with championship ambitions\" is a pretty significant leap. If Holiday were a bit better or they had more immediate access to their contracts from a trade perspective (many are locked until Dec. 15), they might not feel comfortable giving Sheppard the ball. As it stands, they may not have a choice. Fortunately, Sheppard's theoretical fit is strong. The Rockets just ranked 21st in 3-point attempts and percentage. They badly needed shooting regardless. Sheppard brings quite a bit of it, yet he won't need to monopolize the ball. If Houston wants a point guard who will get out of the way while Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun work, Sheppard can do that. He can space the floor as Amen Thompson soaks up more ball-handling possessions. That might be the silver lining to all of this. Without VanVleet, they'll have a far better idea of who Thompson and Sheppard are going to grow into when this year is done. Sheppard's size is a problem on defense, but he was an elite defensive playmaker in college. On this roster, with a nearly limitless supply of long wings, he'll be able to gamble a bit more frequently. Yet starting a player so young and so unproven would be fairly out of character for Udoka, especially given the defensive question marks that come with him. This is a coach who built around two centers that don't shoot last season. If he feels he has to start another wing like Tari Eason or Dorian Finney-Smith (when he's healthy), he'll do so. Sheppard is only going to start if he proves in camp that he deserves to. The Rockets badly hope that he will. Durant's individual offense was obviously a godsend, but this roster badly needed a low-maintenance deadeye shooter as well. So many of their bigger and defense-first lineups were just begging for an inch of breathing room. If Sheppard can bring it, Houston's championship hopes may not be as dead as many assumed once VanVleet went down. We can say pretty safely that we know four Laker starters when everyone is healthy: Luka Dončić, LeBron James , Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton will start. Offensively, you're in great shape with that group. Defensively? Well, it might not be quite as bad as it seems. Ayton was far better at his Phoenix peak, but it's possible a change of scenery reinvigorates him. James may be 40 ( and will miss the start of the season for the first time in his 23-year career ), but he showed last year that he's still a strong defender when he wants to be. Dončić is at least in shape. But still, that's two players who were liabilities last season, a quadragenarian and Ayton, who hasn't consistently tried on defense for several years. Logically, you probably want the fifth starter to be a defender. But who? If Marcus Smart is healthy, he's a former Defensive Player of the Year. But at this stage of his career, he's far better at defending bigger players than he is at hounding guards. He might also be better in a role that limits his minutes, purely from a health perspective. Jarred Vanderbilt can obviously defend guards, but he's such an offensive liability that the Lakers may view the tradeoff as a net negative. Remember, their strength is ball-handling more than spacing. Putting a total non-shooter like Vanderbilt on the floor neuters that ball-handling because it means forcing them to operate with far less room. The alternative here is to just embrace the offense and start Rui Hachimura . Good luck stopping that five. There's no difference between wins in the 100s and wins in the 120s. Starting Hachimura might also be necessary from a roster-building standpoint. He's on an expiring contract. Starting him pumps up his value if the Lakers plan to trade him to preserve cap flexibility. It also keeps him engaged while he's playing for a contract. The last thing they need is for him to grow uncomfortable in a lesser role. Hachimura was a full-time starter last season. Asking anyone to take a demotion, regardless of team needs, can make things uncomfortable in the locker room. This might be a fluid situation. Starting Hachimura early, while they evaluate what Smart still has in the tank and how they can milk any offensive value out of Vanderbilt, might make sense. The Lakers have a real history of making trades during the season as well. Their hope is that Smart or Vanderbilt eventually becomes their top defender. It's also possible that they find that player midseason, and starting Hachimura in the interim maintains continuity from last year's team. For now, that seems like the likeliest approach. Donovan Clingan is presumably going to start for the Blazers at center. One position solved. The other four, at least once everyone is healthy, should be relatively straightforward. Portland has a 21-year-old guard it drafted No. 3 overall ( Scoot Henderson ) and a 22-year-old guard ( Shaedon Sharpe ) it drafted No. 7 overall. They should probably be the starting backcourt. It also has a 24-year-old forward ( Deni Avdija ) it traded for and a 25-year-old forward ( Toumani Camara ) it traded for that were the two best players on the team last season. They should also probably start. Again, this should be simple. But Portland also traded for Jrue Holiday over the summer. Holiday, at this stage of his career, probably did not want to join a team competing for a Play-In berth, and he certainly wouldn't want to come off the bench for such a team after starting for multiple champions. His stature around the league is such that bringing him off of the bench could create issues in the locker room, though Holiday is the consummate professional and likely wouldn't cause them intentionally. There is at least an argument to start him early in the season while Henderson recovers from an injury. But further complicating matters is the presence of the declining Jerami Grant , who said at media day that he doesn't expect to come off of the bench either. The logical play for a team in Portland's position is to emphasize the youth. They aren't ready to compete for a championship yet, but there's talent in the building here. They just need to find a cornerstone player or two. Those four younger players all have chances to fill such a role, but their best hope of getting there involves starting. Henderson has started only 42 games in two years. Sharpe was removed from the starting lineup for a stretch last season. Yes, there's something to be said for forcing younger players to earn their keep, but at a certain point, an organization's priorities need to be in order. It's time to see what they have with these guys. Doing so is far more important than chasing a Play-In berth. Anthony Davis is a center. I know that. You know that. Everyone but the Dallas Mavericks seem to know that. Unfortunately, the Mavericks are the ones making the decision here, so the expectation here is that Davis will start alongside a center, either Dereck Lively or Daniel Gafford , immediately giving Dallas two big men who aren't real threats from 3-point range. Cooper Flagg will be the small forward, and fortunately, he doesn't really take anything off the table. However, if the Mavericks are going to have a functional offense, they are going to have to start offense-centric guards. So let's say that's D'Angelo Russell and Klay Thompson . Five years ago? You're feeling pretty good about that backcourt. Today, Thompson can really only defend big forwards, and Russell can't really defend anyone at all. So in order to even hit the bare minimum from an offensive standpoint, Dallas would probably have to accept an inability to defend the point of attack unless Flagg, as a rookie in a power forward's body, is capable of consistently defending guards. That feels like an unfair expectation. Dallas does have point-of-attack guards it could use. Max Christie , for instance, or against bigger players, Naji Marshall . But with offense at such a premium, removing Russell or Thompson would get iffy. Again, there's a possibility that Flagg just solves this. There have been some rumblings about him playing point guard, and if he can do that, it solves some problems for Dallas. But it's likelier that him doing so is a developmental tactic that helps down the line than an immediately beneficial short-term strategy. The Mavericks could address all of this by playing Davis at center. He and Flagg as the front court would still be a dominant defensive pairing. Thompson could defend forwards. Russell could play point guard on offense. The fifth starter could defend primary opposing ball-handlers. This is the best version of the current Dallas personnel. But to be frank, if the Mavericks knew how to optimize their roster, they'd still have Luka Dončić. They're committed to this double-big alignment. That's going to create deficiencies elsewhere on this extraordinarily unbalanced roster, and which deficiencies they choose to address and ignore will say quite a bit about what kind of team they're trying to put around Davis and Flagg. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Washington Wizards have won a total of 33 games in the last two seasons, and the rebuild is not over. Now that they've acquired three \"second draft\" guys -- AJ Johnson , Cam Whitmore and Dillon Jones -- they have nine players on the roster who were picked in the first round of the last three drafts. All that youth represents possibility, but it doesn't bode well for the Wizards' competitiveness in the short term. Neither does the fact that their 2026 first-round pick is top-eight-protected. This season, then, is about development. Veterans Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum are here to steady the ship, but the big questions are all about the young core: Where is the 20-year-old Alex Sarr's game going on offense? Can the 19-year-old Tre Johnson be more than a bucket-getter ? Can the 21-year-old Bilal Coulibaly and the 20-year-old Bub Carrington improve their spot-up shooting? And with so many 19-to-21-year-olds competing for minutes, can Washington start to carve out an identity? Last year: Twenty games into the season, the Wizards had defeated only one team: The Hawks (twice). And it didn't get much better from there: They finished with the league's worst net rating, worst offense and second-worst record. Midseason, Washington's front office made a bunch of moves, picking up two future second-round picks for Jonas Valanciunas , swapping four future seconds for a 2026 first (likely at the end of the round), absorbing Marcus Smart's contract to get an additional 2025 first and sending Kyle Kuzma to the Bucks for Middleton, AJ Johnson and a 2028 pick swap. The offseason: Washington fell to sixth in the lottery, where it selected Tre Johnson, a 6-foot-5 wing out of Texas. It then traded down from No. 18 to No. 21, where it selected Will Riley , a 6-foot-9 forward out of Illinois, in the process picking up the No. 43 pick (which it used on Jamir Watkins ) and two future seconds. The Wizards also acquired Whitmore for two second-round picks, Jones for a future second and McCollum, Kelly Olynyk and a future second-round pick from the Pelicans . Assuming Jordan Poole was not a part of Washington's future, the McCollum move was savvy: It sent Poole's (longer) contract, Saddiq Bey and the No. 40 pick (which became Micah Peavy ) to New Orleans. It then flipped Olynyk to the Spurs in exchange for Malaki Branham , Blake Wesley and a 2026 second, and it re-signed Marvin Bagley III and Anthony Gill to minimum deals. Las Vegas over/under: 21.5, per BetMGM Wizards believer: If you want to prove that you're not a casual, get it on this team now . Tell your friends that Will Riley is going to be the steal of the draft . Draft Bilal Coulibaly in your fantasy league. Don't just make outlandish claims about the potential of the Tre Johnson-Alex Sarr pick-and-roll; make outlandish claims about the potential of the inverted Sarr-Johnson pick-and-roll. Remember when Draymond Green praised Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington for getting the Wizards to play harder than they had in years? For a rebuilding team, that's the stuff that matters, not the record … which, admittedly, is going to be pretty bad again. Wizards skeptic: Playing hard matters, but accumulating talent matters more. To me, the Wizards are interesting because they didn't get Cooper Flagg or Dylan Harper and, as they position themselves to get Darryn Peterson or A.J. Dybantsa, they will be figuring out which of their young players are worth continuing to invest in. They've already given up on Johnny Davis , the 10th pick in the 2022 draft, and, while there should be plenty of minutes available for Carrington and Johnson in the backcourt, the wing rotation is looking pretty crowded. It's a weird roster in that way, and also in that there are barely any bigs here. I'm concerned that Washington still might not have found a real centerpiece, and that, with this odd collection of players, it'll be hard for the front office to even tell what it has. Wizards believer: People say this kind of thing about every rebuilding team. If you don't have the patience to watch these young guys, then don't! You can just tune in when the Wizards are playoff-bound and ascendant and pretend that you saw it coming all along. Personally, I think they're going to be a more mature, well-balanced team in 2025-26. Jordan Poole was fine last season, I guess, but I'm much more excited to watch Johnson with the ball in his hands. There's a ton of length on this team now, and there should be internal development across the board. Wizards skeptic: What kind of internal development, though? Will Sarr actually be able to finish around the rim consistently in Year 2? Will Coulibaly make defenses pay for ignoring him? Flagg would have changed everything for this franchise, but I'd feel so much better about the Wizards if they'd just wound up with Kon Knueppel . There is a long history of guys like Johnson -- tough shot-maker, not much of a driver, not much of a passer, not much of a defender -- flaming out. Wizards believer: Flaming out?! Johnson hasn't even played an NBA game yet, and you're predicting he's going to be out of here like Davis? Again, be patient! Think about the big picture. The Wizards have a clean cap sheet going forward, a bunch of extra picks at their disposal and a ton of young players with upside. They also have guys like Middleton, McCollum and Corey Kispert -- yep, still here, and still a solid role player! -- to tie lineups together. You can complain about the lack of bigs, I guess, but I like that Sarr will be forced to play the 5 and I'm fine with guys like Coulibaly, George and Cam Whitmore sliding up to the 4 spot. Wizards skeptic: I would have been fine with that a few years ago. Now more teams are playing double-big, and I expect Washington to get beaten up on the boards virtually every night. And while Kelly Olynyk wouldn't have done much about the rebounding issue, I kind of wish the Wizards had kept him anyway. He would have at least served as a connective playmaker and floor spacer, and there's a glaring shortage of guys like that on this roster. And to be clear, I'm not predicting that Johnson will flame out. I'm merely saying that, for a player with his strengths and weaknesses, it's in the realm of possibility. You can call me impatient if you'd like, but I really don't care what Washington's record is this season. I just want to know that the Wizards have found a real keeper or two. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Joe Mazzulla in the elite tier? Where does JJ Redick rank? We're assessing every NBA coach", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In a 2019 interview with John Gonzalez , Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr bemoaned his job title. \"From now on, I'd like to be known as a manager, if you guys don't mind,\" he said. \"Everyone calls me a coach. I'm a manager.\" It's a sentiment plenty of NBA coaches share. At that level, with the best and most intelligent players in the world, the things we think of as \"coaching\" represent only a small part of the job. Much more of it than we realize boils down to managing personalities and relationships. That makes the entire endeavor of ranking and evaluating coaches somewhat futile. A lot of the job is invisible. We occasionally get a glimpse into what happens behind those closed doors. A thoroughly reported feature here. A notable press conference quote there. But we're coming off a season in which multiple winning teams fired their head coaches seemingly out of nowhere. There are eight active head coaches with championship rings... but half of them aren't coaching the teams they won with. That doesn't even include Mike Budenholzer and Michael Malone, both championship winners this decade, both fired within the past year and currently unemployed. It wasn't even the first time this decade that Budenholzer has been axed. The job, for a variety of reasons, has never been harder. When things get tough, they are almost always the organization's first fall guy, and the standards are impossibly high. Tom Thibodeau came six wins shy of the championship. That wasn't good enough for the New York Knicks , who bet the 2025-26 season on the hope that Mike Brown can do what he couldn't. We may not be able to judge coaches fairly, but lately, it hasn't exactly seemed like teams are either. The reality of modern basketball is that almost every head coach is either on the hot seat or soon could be. So we're going to at least try to measure where these coaches stand in this new, job-security-free world. While there are a number of factors we simply aren't privy to, here are the traits we can at least somewhat evaluate: There isn't a defined rubric here, but all of the above factors will be considered. One last thing to keep in mind: the number of good coaches in the NBA today dwarfs the number of bad ones. As last year's firing spree showed, job security is only loosely tied to coaching acumen. A coach being ranked below average on this list does not suggest that he is bad. A coach losing games often says more about his roster than him. Most of the coaches in the NBA could win with the right talent. We are, to some extent anyway, splitting hairs here. With all of that in mind, let's rank the 30 head coaches entering the 2025-26 season. 30. Jordan Ott, Suns 29. Doug Christie, Kings 28. Charles Lee, Hornets 27. Mitch Johnson, Spurs 26. Tuomas Iisalo, Grizzlies As has become tradition on this list, the final spot is occupied by the least experienced coach. Jordan Ott is our only first-time head coach going into the 2025-26 season, however, in an occurrence we're unlikely to ever see again, there are four separate head coaches who took over on an interim basis in the middle of last season and are now entering their first training camps as head coaches even though they've coached games. Ott is a perfectly qualified first-time head coach, though given Mat Ishbia's insistence on hiring within the Michigan State family, the onus is going to be on him to prove he's the right man for the job in Phoenix. The Kings had a better record under Doug Christie last season (27-24) than they did under Mike Brown (13-18), but their net rating actually dropped slightly from 1.6 to 0.0 after the coaching change. Brown was the victim of poor clutch luck and a star that was clearly on the way out. Christie had to wade through the mess of the De'Aaron Fox trade as well the standard Sacramento nonsense, so he shouldn't be judged too harshly, but there wasn't too much to latch onto in his first few months on the job. Sacramento's defense took a meaningful step back in Brown's absence, which is unsurprising given his stellar defensive track record, and a home Play-In loss to a Mavericks team that was more or less without guards was pretty discouraging. There's no fair way to judge Charles Lee on his first season in Charlotte. He took over a pretty limited and extremely young roster that dealt with injuries to basically every notable player and one of the strangest mid-season distractions in recent memory (the cancelled Mark Williams trade). There were some promising indicators when it comes to process. Charlotte largely took the right shots, finishing above league average in 3-point rate and mostly eschewing long-2s. The defense vastly over performed with Moussa Diabaté at center, something to watch this season with no entrenched veterans ahead of him. For now, think of Lee as you would any other promising young coach. Speaking of bizarre circumstances, Mitch Johnson took over for perhaps the greatest coach in NBA history in the middle of the season for a team that made a blockbuster trade in February and then lost its best player to a rare medical issue. There's not nearly enough high-stakes basketball to render any real judgment here, but there were some really promising signs here as well. The Spurs finished eighth in the NBA in 3-point attempt rate, for instance, and while Popovich had already been trending back in that direction, a lot of his late tenure in San Antonio was marked by poor team-wide shot diets. We'll have a much better idea of what sort of coach Johnson will be after this season, but they were reasonably competitive before Victor Wembanyama went down, so it's not hard to imagine him jumping pretty meaningfully next year. Already working in his favor: San Antonio had the second-most efficient offense after timeouts in the NBA last season. The Grizzlies didn't have the players last season to make much postseason noise, and they still probably don't, but Tuomas Iisalo made a good first impression given the pieces that he had. He obviously won points with key players for introducing more pick-and-roll back into an offense that totally abandoned it as they revamped their system last year, but he's clearly a creative schematic mind on both ends of the floor. Using Zach Edey to guard Jimmy Butler , for example, was a bold step very few coaches, let alone coaches trying to prove they deserve a job in a postseason game, would take. Did it work? More than the stats suggest, less than the Grizzlies hoped, but having a coach who's willing to take risks and experiment matters. It seems as though the Grizzlies have one.

Claim your offer now : 25. Brian Keefe, Wizards 24. Willie Green, Pelicans 23. Darko Rajakovic, Raptors 22. Doc Rivers, Bucks Brian Keefe could arguably be in the \"not enough information\" tier. There's only so much you can do with a team that is tanking as nakedly as Washington, but with a year and a half on the job, you'd hope to see a bit more of a coach's imprint on a team than we've seen with the Wizards . They certainly improved down the stretch, so it's encouraging to see that Keefe has managed to ward off the sort of losing culture that so often follows tanks like this. But the Wizards haven't established a definable playing style yet, and given how raw so many of their youngsters are, it might be a while before they do. In April, The Athletic released its annual anonymous player poll, and Keefe won the worst coach category with 24.7% of the vote. Willie Green deserves some measure of sympathy. He had a healthy team for, what, three months? The Pelicans were good during that brief stretch of the 2023-24 season. Otherwise, injuries have doomed his tenure in New Orleans. Still, he hasn't helped matters lately. The Pelicans never shoot 3s, and that was true even when they had the NBA 's best shooting coach in Fred Vinson. He never quite figured out how to get Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram to coexist, and a lot of their bad habits persisted under his watch. It seems notable that the Pelicans did not allow James Borrego to interview as associate head coach for the Knicks this offseason. They were under no obligation to. It would have been a lateral move, and there's no defined industry standard on that front. But teams will reasonably often allow assistants to move in the best interests of their career, and Borrego could have sold himself as a future head coach far more easily on a winning Knicks team than he will on the rebuilding Pelicans. Yet New Orleans held onto Borrego. It's hard not to read that as the Pelicans wanting to keep a potential interim coach or even a permanent replacement in the building. Darko Rajakovic is in the same boat as Keefe. He's had two full years on the job, so we can't say there's no information here, but they've been two years of roster overhauls, injuries and tanking. The Raptors were indeed bad last season, but not as bad as you think. They went 48-33-1 against the spread last season, covering 59.3% of their games. Only the Thunder covered more. The Raptors played close games. They just lost them because they usually had worse players. But they played hard even with nothing to play for, especially down the stretch, when their defense came alive and ranked second in the league after the All-Star break. Offense remains an issue, though in fairness, Rajakovic has at least tried to make up for Toronto's lack of individual creation with solid ball-movement. The Raptors have ranked sixth in the NBA in passes in both of his seasons on the job. There's promise here. It's just hard to judge a coach in mostly low-stakes games. You know the Doc Rivers shtick by now. He's been doing this for 25 years. His teams run predictable offenses and ignore the offensive glass. His defenses lately have left plenty to be desired, and those uninspiring tactics are probably responsible for some of his blown 3-1 leads. Above all else, Rivers is great at getting jobs. Owners love him. Stars, at least early on, love him. But it also feels notable that in that Athletic poll, Rivers, came in third with 12.7% of the vote for worst coach, and unlike Keefe, he couldn't fall back on limited experience or poor rosters. Whether he's wearing on players with time or if there are simply some types of players that don't mesh well with his style is unclear, but his reputation has taken plenty of hits in recent years, and it doesn't help that so often makes excuses for his shortcomings. Considering the talent he's had since leaving Boston, his failure to even reach a conference finals is extremely disappointing. 21. Chauncey Billups, Trail Blazers 20. JB Bickerstaff, Pistons 19. Billy Donovan, Bulls 18. Mike Brown, Knicks 17. Jason Kidd, Mavericks 16. Jamahl Mosley, Magic Chauncey Billups entered last season on a scorching hot seat. He left it with an extension after a strong finish in which Portland went .500 in its last 26 games and played some of the best second-half defense in basketball. Like Toronto, Portland benefitted from a relatively easy schedule to power that late-season success, but the Blazers doubled down on it by trading for Jrue Holiday . They expect to be competitive this season in a strong Western Conference. The defense can probably hold up its end of the bargain. Can the offense? The Blazers have struggled on basically every front offensively under BIllups besides offensive rebounding. Portland is the only team to rate in the bottom five in the NBA in points per possession on after timeout plays in each of the past two seasons, which isn't a great look for a coach who's drawing those plays up. His old-school lineup tendencies should raise eyebrows as well. Scoot Henderson was the No. 3 overall pick. That he's started 42 games in two years doesn't show a strong enough commitment to player development and allowing a youngster to work through his mistakes on the court. Removing the similarly gifted Shaedon Sharpe from the starting five midseason last year was a similar head-scratcher, though he eventually made it back. Yes, there's something to be said for forcing young players to earn their keep, but this was an example of a coach's short-term priorities conflicting with the best long-term interests of the franchise. Balancing those needs this season will be critical for Billups. JB Bickerstaff specializes in one sort of coaching job, but he does it exceedingly well. When you need a coach to take over a young team and professionalize it, he's your man. Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell trade was only feasible because he helped rebuild the Cavaliers far faster than anyone anticipated. Detroit's 30-win jump last season speaks for itself. There's something to be said for a coach who can immediately come in and create a create a winning culture. He takes teams from Point A to Point B. It's that next step that's proven problematic. Bickerstaff's playoff track record, though brief, is disappointing. The 2023 loss to the Knicks was a disaster. Last year's loss was more defensible as a lower seed with a younger roster, but that was a winnable series. The reporting surrounding the 2023-24 season made it clear that he'd lost Cleveland's locker room. We know he can coach young players. In Detroit, we'll find out in the coming years if he's equipped to turn veterans into real contenders. Kenny Atkinson taking over nearly the same Cleveland roster and turning it into a juggernaut was fairly damning. Schematically, he left Bickerstaff's stodgy offense in the dust. Give Billy Donovan this: he coaches the team he has, not the team he wants. When he had DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , he let them pound the rock. When the roster skewed younger, faster and more eager to shoot, he played into its strengths. The Bulls were the NBA 's second-fastest team last season, and they took the the third-most 3s. Even in Oklahoma City, when three of his best players were point guards, he just played three point guards. Far too many coaches fixate on the sort of style they'd prefer to run. That's never been a flaw of Donovan's. Unfortunately, the teams he's had have been largely underwhelming since he arrived in Chicago, so that's made it difficult to truly evaluate him against the league's best. Mike Brown teams always defend. Even the defensively inept Kings rosters of the past few seasons have hovered around league-average. Offense has usually been the problem. His bizarre decision to try to implement the Princeton offense with the 2012-13 Lakers was a contributor to his stunning dismissal only five games into the season. The 2022-23 Kings, who posted historic numbers, were far more modern. But the league seemingly caught up a year later. Suddenly, the Kings couldn't get to the basket to save their lives, and Brown couldn't adjust. Some of last year's decisions were downright bizarre. Why exactly was he bringing Keon Ellis off of the bench when he was the only reliable 3-and-D player on the team? As offensive creativity and better lineup management were two of the major reasons the Knicks fired Tom Thibodeau, Brown will be put to the test early and often this season, though the early preseason returns have been encouraging. Judging Jason Kidd as a coach feels almost impossible. His teams never play to expectations. They're either way better or way worse than you think they'll be. The Bucks were a mess when he took them over. They immediately made the playoffs only to backslide and eventually get fixed by Mike Budenholzer. At first, the Mavericks were on the same trajectory: great in his debut season as they raced to the 2022 Western Conference finals, disappointing in a lottery follow-up. He bucked that trend by making the 2024 Finals. His playoff success has largely come on the back of stellar defensive game-planning. His offenses never move the ball and have fairly inconsistent shot selection. How much of that is him vs. the players he has? A Luka Dončić is really only going to play one way. Speaking of which... do we dock points for Kidd not throwing his body in front of the Dončić trade? We don't quite know how much of a participant he was in that debacle. Without him this year, though, we'll get a much cleaner look at what sort of offensive vision Kidd has without the NBA's most heliocentric ball-handler. He'll need a good one to compensate for this unbalanced roster. Jamahl Mosley rounds out this group of strong defensive coaches with serious offensive question marks. He's just at the extreme end of both spectrums. The Magic had the No. 2 defense in the NBA last season despite everyone being injured. They also ranked 27th in offense. Mosley has never topped 22nd. The Magic had the dubious distinction of being the worst after-timeout offense in the NBA last season, never a good look for a coach. They shoot too many long 2s and not nearly enough 3s. They're below league average in passing every year. Obviously, some of this is roster-related. The Magic prioritize big wings more than skilled scorers, and injuries have forced Mosley to try to make lemonade out of the lemons he's so often had. He should be commended for that. The Magic have, by and large, overperformed on his watch, and getting young, offense-centric prospects like Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner to take the sort of pride in playing defense that he has is extremely encouraging. But you can't be in the top half of a list like this without once having coached a decent offense. With Desmond Bane in place, maybe this is the year Mosley does so. 15. David Adelman, Nuggets 14. Jordi Fernandez, Nets 13. JJ Redick, Lakers David Adelman is the only coach in NBA history with more playoff wins (seven) than regular-season wins (three). That will soon change, and frankly, his ranking likely will as well. His postseason was so encouraging that if his upcoming regular season goes as expected, he may well be a top-10 coach next year. He effectively beat the Clippers with six players. His zone defense nearly confounded the Thunder in the second round. He was widely credited for designing Denver's offense even as an assistant. The sample is the only thing keeping him here. We can't anoint a coach after two months of work. But Adelman's start was stellar. The Nuggets vastly outperformed expectations in the playoffs. Speaking of outperforming expectations, Jordi Fernandez singlehandedly ruined Brooklyn's very overt tanking plans. He was so good in his debut campaign that the Nets had to trade Dennis Schröder on literally the first day Golden State could make the salaries work just to weaken the roster. His absence in Sacramento was acutely felt last season, and while De'Aaron Fox likely forces his way out either way, the bad vibes were hard to miss in the context of the widespread praise Fernandez has earned from players basically everywhere he's been. Redick is the most interesting case of the three. You can point to the most overt negatives here, such as his questionable decision not to use his bench in the second half of Game 4 against Minnesota. His response to that decision in his pregame press conference in Game 5 raised eyebrows as well. Redick's temperament was a frequent talking point in his debut season. He doesn't exactly project calm and composure. But that's something that should come with time and experience. The things he did bring to the Lakers as a rookie, with no assistant experience, were far rarer. Tactically speaking, Redick was mostly brilliant in his debut campaign. He designed an aggressive, switching defense that thrived without Anthony Davis , and he was able to tailor game plans to specific opponents far more than most head coaches do in the regular season. He drew widespread praise for the ball-denial approach he deployed against Nikola Jokić, for instance. The offense was far more structured than it was under Darvin Ham, and even with the introduction of Dončić, the Lakers still improved from 25th to 9th in passes per game and from 28th to 14th in 3-point attempt rate. Redick made rookie mistakes in the playoffs. He's far from the first coach to do so. But he's about all of the right things from a strategic perspective and is well on his way to becoming a very good NBA head coach. 12. Nick Nurse, 76ers We're going to address last year's rankings a few times as we get to the top of this list, and that starts with Nick Nurse, who I placed No. 2. If you want to argue that he's the second-best coach in the NBA , the evidence exists. He's exceedingly creative strategically, and the 2019 Finals, in which he threw box-and-one and triangle-and-two defenses at Stephen Curry , were a perfect showcase for that. He has at several points vastly exceeded expectations from a roster perspective, such as the 2020 follow-up in which the Raptors were the No. 2 seed despite losing Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, or the 2021-22 season in which he led a Raptors team fresh off the No. 4 pick to 48 wins. Before Joel Embiid got hurt in January of 2024, he was undeniably playing the best basketball of his career, including his MVP season. Nurse's revamped offense deserves some credit for that. He also seemingly lost the locker room at the end in Toronto, and even as Philadelphia tanked last season, it would be hard to ignore the lifelessness of the entire 76ers season. The defensive effort was notably poor at times. The offense so often boiled down to \"well, whose turn is to dribble?\" You can argue Nurse is an elite coach. You can also argue, based on those negatives, that he was great early on and has since faded meaningfully. Let's see how this year goes. 11. Will Hardy, Jazz 10. Kenny Atkinson, Cavaliers 9. Quin Snyder, Hawks 8. Chris Finch, Timberwolves Will Hardy has won less than 35% of his NBA games, but just got extended through 2031. That doesn't happen to most coaches in his shoes. It happened for Hardy because the Jazz have been actively tying his hands behind his back. They won 68 games in his first two seasons when their goal was likely to win between 30 and 40 in total. He so overperformed that Danny Ainge had to kneecap his roster in February by trading away a bunch of veterans. It took the Jazz two years to build a roster bad enough that even Hardy couldn't make it competitive. It will therefore be a few years before we'll see what he can do with a good roster, but he's done so much with so little that it would be foolish to deny him his place in the top half of this list just because of the teams he's had. We knew Mark Daigneault was good before the Thunder were. This is the same thing. Sometimes, coaching success comes down to luck. If Hardy hadn't taken the Utah job, he almost certainly would have replaced Ime Udoka in Boston instead of Joe Mazzulla and would probably have a championship by now. He's not a bad coach because he got hired by a bad team. He's a great coach waiting for his team to catch up to him. In three years with the Jazz, he's managed a .500 record with his most-used starting lineups in each season (28-28). Don't blame him for rarely actually being allowed to use your best lineups. Kenny Atkinson and Quin Snyder are very appropriately neck-and-neck. They're both branches off of the Mike Budenholzer coaching tree. They both almost always overperform their regular-season expectations, and each has a No. 1 seed to their name. Their offenses follow defined and sensible structures. Snyder tends to build spread pick-and-roll offenses around a high-end ball-handler or two, but allow for wings to create out of the advantages their guards generate. Atkinson runs plenty of pick-and-roll as well, but in Cleveland last year he ensured that the system was extremely egalitarian. The ball movement was limited, but lethal. The Cavaliers let one of their many ball-handlers generate an advantage and then pass into a wide-open 3, which almost always fell. Defensively, both favor drop coverage, but now have far more flexible personnel than they did at earlier stops in their careers. Both are highly-regarded player developers. Snyder gets the slim edge because he has more experience, but you can't go wrong either way. Has Chris Finch ever had a normal season or team? He took over the Timberwolves in the middle of the 2020-21 campaign, drawing plenty of criticism as he bypassed potential interim candidates in Minnesota. He's been at the helm for four full seasons, and in three of them he's had fairly distinct rosters: the deeper Anthony Edwards-Karl-Anthony Towns group of the 2021-22 season, the Rudy Gobert jumbo team of the two seasons after, and then, last season, he was forced to redesign everything right before camp when the Timberwolves traded Towns for Julius Randle . It's never traditional, and that has never mattered. Finch keeps figuring out how to make the most of bizarre circumstances. He coaxed two great playoff rounds out of Randle after the Knicks never even got one. He figured out how to make a two-big offenses work with several different flavors of center. Minnesota's stellar defense with Gobert has drawn justifiable praise, but remember, Finch's 2022 team ranked 13th in defense with Towns at center and defending largely on the perimeter in an ultra-aggressive scheme that looked nothing like the Gobert teams. If you were to distill all of the strategic elements of coaching into a single term, it would be problem-solving. How do you overcome the challenges the league presents with the tools your general manager provides, knowing that most of the time, those tools are going to be imperfect and ill-suited for certain opponents? Part of the reason the Timberwolves feel so comfortable frequently swapping Finch's tools around and giving him bizarre fits is that they trust him to figure out how to make the most of them. 7. Joe Mazzulla, Celtics 6. Mark Daigneault, Thunder 5. Ime Udoka, Rockets 4. Steve Kerr, Warriors 3. Ty Lue, Clippers 2. Erik Spoelstra, Heat Our last two championship coaches are, by far, the most interesting names on this list. Last year, I ranked Joe Mazzulla 11th. Celtics fans were predictably upset. My logic at the time was, essentially, that evaluating him, given the remarkably gifted roster he was coaching, was almost impossible. Think about the problem-solving we discussed with Chris Finch. It's hard to judge a coach's problem-solving when their roster is so good that they'll rarely have problems. To an extent, Mark Daigneault dealt with similar circumstances last spring. His roster was so much better than the ones he was coaching against that evaluating him so early into his playoff career was pretty difficult. The sample, in both cases, remains small. Based on the visible components of coaching, Mazzulla and Daigneault had rocky 2025 postseasons. Mazzulla refused to back off from his \"fire a billion 3s\" approach to offense, even with enormous leads against the Knicks, which created enough variance for New York to come back and win games it really should've lost. He couldn't solve Mitchell Robinson or New York's switching on defense. He stuck with the compromised Kristaps Porziņģis for far too long. We don't know how that series would have played out if Jayson Tatum had remained healthy. However, you could argue that Mazzulla was the reason the Celtics fell down 3-1 in the series. Yes, Boston suffered unsustainably poor shooting variance... but it hurt them as much as it did because Mazzulla drilled high-risk shot-selection into their heads all season. When faced with more significant problems than he had to deal with in 2024, he couldn't solve them. Daigneault won the championship last season, but there were some pretty visible foibles along the way. He completely bungled the \"foul up three\" strategy in Game 1 against the Nuggets, leading to a stunning loss. He struggled to crack David Adelman's zone defense, allowing Denver to come within one game of stealing a series it had no business winning. Yes, Indiana stunned everyone this past postseason, but the Game 1 collapse and Game 6 no-show were jarring. Why did he change his starting lineup before the Finals began? That was an own-goal. What sort of conversations would we be having about the Thunder and Daigneault if Tyrese Haliburton hadn't torn his Achilles? Like Mazzulla in 2025, Daigneault's playoff run was filled with question marks. Like Mazzulla in 2024, his roster gave him a big enough talent buffer over the competition that he overcame them. We shouldn't ignore what happened last spring, but we shouldn't pretend that they represent definitional flaws for very good coaches either. Everything we've covered in this space represents the visible, but as we addressed early on, the things we see so directly are only a small part of what really comprises coaching. It is obvious, based on watching their teams for full seasons, that Mazzulla and Daigneault excel in the less visible components of coaching. They have developed systems and structures that should allow for sustainable winning so long as the rosters are equipped to do so. Mazzulla probably needs to be a bit more flexible with his shot-selection, but the system he's installed has done far more good for Boston than harm. Daigneault has built an all-time defense and a locker room culture that seems as sturdy as any we've had in the NBA for some time. These are great coaches. They are also relatively early in their coaching journeys, and therefore more prone to mistakes that more experienced counterparts might be able to avoid. If you're good enough to win championships through your growing pains, well, odds are you're heading somewhere pretty special. There is a chance these are one day the two best coaches in the NBA. With hindsight, I would've ranked Mazzulla higher last season. I think what happened last spring was also reasonable proof that Mazzulla still has room to grow as a coach. The lesson, generally, is that we shouldn't anoint coaches too early. So naturally, that means we're about to cover a coach who, with the playoffs factored in, has actually coached even fewer games than Mazzulla and Daigneault. Ime Udoka is the only one of the three not to have won a championship yet, but he has made the Finals, and he's never had the same overwhelming roster advantage that they had in their championship runs. Here's a fun fact: all three teams Udoka has coached have improved by double-digit wins, even if you adjust Boston's 2020-21 win total to reflect the shortened season. He's simultaneously remarkably inventive and fairly old-school. How many modern coaches would have considered trying the Alperen Sengun-Steven Adams duo? Udoka turned it into Houston's secret weapon. Turning Robert Williams III into an off-ball rover defensively turned a .500 Celtics team into a juggernaut that came two wins short of the title. He's an underrated offensive coach as well. His lone Celtics team was the best after-timeout offense in basketball, and last year's Rockets ranked ninth. His offenses could stand to shoot more 3s, but that's a personnel issue more than a coaching one, as it wasn't a problem in Boston. In two brief stints with two different teams, Udoka has developed cultures of accountability and effort that have turned both of his groups into winners. He is the NBA's best current coach without a championship ring. What separates the first three coaches in this tier from the next three is longevity. Our final four coaches have each won titles and reached the Finals multiple times, combining for eight rings and 16 conference titles among them. Mazzulla, Daigneault and Udoka are elite, but Mazzulla and Daigneault have largely worked around a single basic roster construct, while Udoka obviously does not have a title yet. These coaches have all built long-term winners around several different iterations of their rosters, even if only one of them has coached multiple teams. Steve Kerr is about as divisive as Hall of Fame coaches get. Even his own fans wish he'd simplify things and just run more pick-and-roll a lot of the time. Just remember that before he took over, Mark Jackson somehow led an offense with Stephen Curry that somehow ranked 30th in the NBA in passes per game. The overwhelming majority of NBA coaches would have taken one look at Curry and slapped together the obvious, heliocentric offense that 90% of star guards run. Kerr devised a scheme that not only maximized an all-time great player but kept everyone on the roster just as engaged. When he stumbled into a similarly gifted defender in Draymond Green , he again leaned into the specific gifts of his star and reimagined Golden State's defense around switching and versatility. You can perhaps argue with his recent player-development track record. So much for the two timelines, eh? But just think about how many coaches get fired every year because their offense is too vanilla or their supporting players are too uninvolved. Those teams all wish that Steve Kerr were their head coach. Ty Lue still hasn't had a single, start-to-finish healthy season coaching the Clippers. Perhaps if he had, he'd have a second ring by now. It's hard to argue with a coach who managed to reach Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals without his best player back in 2021. Last year, the Clippers went 24-21 without Kawhi Leonard on the floor. The Clippers let Paul George walk for nothing in part because they knew Lue could take the depth his absence would provide and turn it into a cohesive team. They were right. The Clippers ranked No. 3 in the NBA in defense last season despite not having an All-Defensive selection. They rank near the top of the league in offense after timeouts basically every year because Lue is one of the best play-designers in basketball. He's a renowned playoff adjuster, even if it sometimes takes him a bit too long to make the changes that so often alter series. And if LeBron James respects you enough to let you tell him to \"shut the f--- up,\" you're probably pretty well-liked by your players. The Clippers once again enter the season with serious uncertainty, but they have a coach that's more than capable of guiding them through it. Erik Spoelstra has been the consensus best coach in the NBA for years now. When we started these rankings a season ago, I never for a moment believed he'd fall off his perch in future installments. The resume speaks for itself. Six Finals trips in the past 15 years. A seemingly endless supply of second-round picks and undrafted free agents developing into legitimate NBA players under his watch. An offense that, for years, balanced the talent of his stars with the need to keep the whole roster engaged. A defense that almost always overperformed. A culture so renowned that they put it on the jerseys. There's no such thing as a perfect coach, but if you let every fanbase pick one to lead their team, for the past half-decade or so, the universal answer would have been Spoelstra. It still could be. Miami's roster has been a mess lately. But last year was probably the first true disappointment a Spoelstra team has experienced since the 2011 Finals. He's far from the only person in Miami culpable for the embarrassing Jimmy Butler saga, but it's ultimately the coach's job to keep locker room peace. From Feb. 1 on, only the Hornets were worse in fourth quarters as the Heat posted a staggeringly poor -12 net rating in final frames. Miami's conditioning and strategic brilliance have historically made them a great end-of-game team. Last year, they choked away game after game after game in the second half. The offense got stale. Was that the result of Butler's absence, or have the Heat gotten a bit complacent? There were even small game-management mistakes that you never used to see in Miami. Spoelstra cost the Heat a game against the Pistons by pulling a Chris Webber and calling a timeout he didn't have. If your team hired Erik Spoelstra tomorrow, you'd still feel great about it. He's just not quite as bulletproof as he has been in years past. By his lofty standards, he just had a down year. Meanwhile, our No. 1 coach is coming off one of the best years of his career. 1. Rick Carlisle, Pacers One of the many little delights of Indiana's surprising run to the NBA Finals last season was that it forced a critical reappraisal of Rick Carlisle's coaching career. The ugly end of his time in Dallas obscured just how much he was really doing to hold together a crumbling organization. He faced plenty of criticism for failing to win a playoff series in his last decade with the Mavericks, but it makes a lot more sense when you actually look at the series he was coaching in. His No. 8-seeded Mavericks pushed the 2014 Spurs to seven games. Neither LeBron James and the Heat (five) nor Kevin Durant and the Thunder (six) did the same. The Kawhi Leonard-Paul George Clippers may be something of a joke now, but he pushed them to the brink twice as massive underdogs. Watching him come one injury short of a championship as a No. 4 seed last season reframed all of those losses to the broader basketball-viewing public. Those weren't disappointments. They were part of a career-long trend of Carlisle teams outperforming expectations in the playoffs, examples of him dragging teams far closer to victory than they had any right of getting. Even the 2011 championship team in Dallas did that. They didn't have home-court advantage in the last three rounds! We covered Billy Donovan as an example of a coach who tailors his playing style to his roster, and Carlisle is the pinnacle of that virtue in all of basketball. At the time, the 2019-20 Mavericks were the most efficient offense in NBA history and they were built largely around Dončić slowly dribbling. In Indiana, he's built a similarly dominant group around Tyrese Haliburton 's selflessness and pace. The 2023-24 Pacers were extremely limited on defense, so he shrugged, conceded the rim entirely, and survived by allowing the fewest 3-pointers in the NBA by far. It took him a while to get here, as he was famously hesitant to cede play-calling duties to Jason Kidd, but with time, he's become a chameleon, able to adapt to whatever players he has. You won't find a more creative play-designer in basketball. His full-court football style plays have become a nerd favorite. He's willing to find uses for anyone, no matter how deep they are on his bench. Tony Bradley played only 14 regular-season games for the Pacers last season, but Carlisle rediscovered him in the Eastern Conference finals and used him to help swing some precarious bench minutes. In that seven-game loss to the Clippers in 2021, he used Boban Marjanović for more total minutes than he'd played in April and May combined in the regular season because the small-ball Clippers presented a matchup advantage. Carlisle benches are almost universally good, whether their talent suggests that they should be or not. His player development track record speaks for itself. He was Jalen Brunson 's first NBA coach. Look at Aaron Nesmith before and after Carlisle got his hands on him. Andrew Nembhard was a second-round pick. We could go on and on and on. The job of a coach is fundamentally to make the most of the players that he has. While Carlisle has had some great ones over the years, he's never been blessed with the sort of obvious juggernauts that his more famous counterparts like Pat Riley or Phil Jackson had. That's probably why he's rarely been a part of the discussion when it comes to the greatest coaches in NBA history. But after what we just witnessed, we really can't deny him his place in that group anymore. All Carlisle has done for the past two-and-a-half decades is exceed expectations. His teams win more than they should. His players grow beyond who we thought they could be. If there was any doubt, last spring punched Carlisle's ticket to the Hall of Fame, and it assured him the top spot among the league's current crop of coaches. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kudos to Dyson Daniels on breaking one of my least favorite streaks in the NBA . Last season, he won Most Improved Player without making the All-Star team. The last player to do so was Pascal Siakam , and he and CJ McCollum are the only active players to win the award without also having made the All-Star Game for the first time in that season. With Ivica Zubac finishing second, the only first-time All-Star to even finish in the top five was Cade Cunningham in third place. Could Daniels represent a change in how the electorate perceives this award? That will take years to play out. What we can note for now is that we had six first-time All-Stars last year along with three second-time All-Stars and three third-time selections. In other words, many of the young players who had been blocked out by older stars in the past have already broken through. There certainly could be a new crop of first-timers this season, but there are fewer logical candidates for that than usual. So without the first-time All-Star marker as our north star, what are we looking for in a Most Improved Player? Timing is the starting point. Seven of the last 15 awards have gone to third-year players, and four of the remaining eight have gone to fourth-year players. No second-year player has won the award since Monta Ellis in 2007. We're therefore looking for players at the end of their rookie deals, and as 17 of the past 18 winners have been first-round picks, we're looking primarily at a 60-player group: the first rounds of the 2022 and 2023 NBA Drafts. Even within those groups, we can trim the fat further. Knock out three players for already having made All-Star teams ( Paolo Banchero , Jalen Williams and Victor Wembanyama ), 10 more for not having full-time roster spots ( Johnny Davis , AJ Griffin , David Roddy , Marjon Beauchamp , Wendell Moore, Patrick Baldwin, TyTy Washington, Jalen Hood-Schifino , Olivier-Maxence Prosper and Nick Smith) and we're already down to 47 before even considering team circumstances and individual performance through two years. The majority of candidates we will seriously consider will come out of that pool of players. But for the moment, we'll keep the field open. Below, we'll break down the odds for Most Improved Player into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +2000 or shorter), the middle of the pack (odds between +2000 and +4000) and the long shots (+4000 and beyond) to try to figure out where the best betting value lies in this always contentious market.

Claim your offer now : There are only four players in this tier. For reasons we'll explain shortly, we're going to hold off on covering one. There is another I'm less interested in: Andrew Nembhard (+1200). There is another Pacer that offers more value down the line. The difference between Nembhard's regular-season 3-point shooting (33.5%) and playoff 3-point shooting (47.3%) has thrown people off of his night-to-night value a bit. Unless you believe he's going to shoot like he does in the playoffs, he's just not going to score enough to realistically factor into this race. So that leaves with two candidates I do like, and they happen to be brothers: Amen Thompson is the favorite at +900, while Ausar Thompson isn't far behind at +2000. The logic for Amen is obvious. With Fred VanVleet out, the ball is going to be in his hands far more than it was a year ago, and with Kevin Durant in place and Reed Sheppard likely to get more minutes, Houston should have more space to operate with offensively. That's a formula for Thompson to get to the basket quite a bit and rack up both points and assists, which in turn is a formula for a first-time All-Star selection if the Rockets are as good as we expect them to be. If that's how this plays out, he's an obvious candidate. As for Ausar, we're cheating a little bit. We saw Amen break out in his second season, but Ausar missed the beginning of his sophomore campaign because of a blood clot. He worked his way into a starting role midseason, but the theory here is that he's due for a breakout similar to his brother's with his role now assured and a full training camp to get ready. He won't have the ball as much as Amen, but the bar here is lower as he isn't starting with the same expectations. Ausar was terrific down the stretch last season and should be able to build on that success now. We mentioned a player in the first category that we were skipping over. That would be Deni Avdija (+1700). We did so because there are two other Blazers with reasonably short odds that also needed to be covered, so we're going to lump them together. Shaedon Sharpe is at +3000, while Scoot Henderson is at +4000. The theory here is that Portland's defense is going to be good enough to make the Blazers at least a play-in-caliber team. Therefore, if one of these players breaks out on offense, they could compete for a true playoff spot. Avdija having the shortest odds doesn't make much sense to me. For starters, his breakout has sort of already happened. He was terrific down the stretch, and when his shot is falling, he's a very good offensive player. But he's much more of a secondary creator than a primary offensive option. Portland's long-term hopes hinge on the more athletic and higher upside Henderson and/or Sharpe taking a major leap. I think both could be good bets, but in different ways. If you want to bet one now, bet Sharpe. He has reportedly been a training camp standout. Henderson is recovering from a hamstring injury and will miss the beginning of the season. You'll get much better odds if you wait until his odds drop ahead of his return. Someone is going to become the early favorite here, and Henderson, without playing, will become a long shot. As for the rest of this group, I'm immediately ruling out Matas Buzelis (+2000) and Reed Sheppard (+2200) for being second-year players. Josh Giddey (+3000) and Payton Pritchard (+3500) are both a bit more interesting for reasons that extend beyond their ages. Both are going to have the ball more than ever this season. Giddey averaged 20 points, 8.5 assists and 9.9 rebounds after the Zach LaVine trade last year. If he does that over the full season while shooting anywhere close to the 45.3% he nailed from 3-point range in that stretch, he's going to finish near the top of the ballot. Even if the 3-point shooting predictably dips, he can make up for it with more volume. The same is true for Pritchard, who is playing without Jayson Tatum , Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis ahead of him in the pecking order. Do I expect him to post All-Star-caliber stats in a role with unlimited freedom? Probably not. But the value here isn't crazy. Outside of Sharpe and perhaps Giddey, my favorite player in this tier is Bennedict Mathurin (+2500). Mathurin has always been an odd fit in Indiana's free-flowing system. He wants the ball in his hands and to operate like a more traditional star scorer. We saw the volatility of that style in the playoffs, when he seemingly was either great or invisible with no in-between. Well, now that Tyrese Haliburton is out, Indiana badly needs someone to take on a high-volume scoring role. Mathurin, in a contract role, will eagerly oblige. The final two players in this range are Michael Porter Jr . and Jonathan Kuminga , both at +4000. I'm out on both. Kuminga may be great when he's inevitably traded, but he won't get enough minutes before that to realistically factor into this race. The theory for Porter is that, on a normal bad team with the ball more than he had it in Denver, he could break out as the high-usage scorer he was meant to be as a prospect. Frankly, nothing that happened in Denver suggests he's a capable enough ball-handler to be a 25-point scorer consistently. That's the bar, and I can't see him reaching it. We're going to split the long shots into two groups. The first are plausible first-time All-Stars. The second is players due for massive role increases after having toiled in obscurity. For the first group, we have four names: Trey Murphy (+5000), Jalen Johnson (+6000), Coby White (+6000) and, I can't believe I'm saying this, Deandre Ayton (+20000). Let's get the obvious out of the way: I don't remotely suspect Ayton to actually be an All-Star. I'm just playing the narrative game on incredibly long odds. If the Lakers are awesome and he looks more like he did in Phoenix, there will be a groundswell of support behind him similar to the one Julius Randle received when he won in 2021. The model here is basically Ayton being a model citizen, playing great defense, setting screens, getting to the line more and benefitting from the great playmaking he'll have in Los Angeles. I don't think he'll ultimately compete for this award, but I can't ignore the chance at 200-to-1. The other three are much more plausible. White posted All-Star scoring numbers in the second half of last season. Johnson would have been an All-Star last year if he hadn't gotten hurt. But Murphy is my favorite player in that group as he can scale up if Zion Williamson gets hurt or play well off of him if he doesn't. He flashed star upside last season when injuries made him the primary option for a stretch, and he's a nerd favorite, so if he plays like he did at his best last year, there is already baked in support. And then there are the the less obvious breakout candidates. Here, we have three names: Jay Huff (+5000), Neemias Queta (+6000) and Jarace Walker (+15000). We obviously have two Pacer front court players here. One is a former No. 8 overall pick whose been buried on the depth chart but looked good in small doses. The other is a per-minute darling with the skill set best suited to replace the bulk of Myles Turner 's role. Either are solid choices. Queta, simply by virtue of jumping from a bit player to a possible starter on a high-profile team, is going to get some buzz early in the season if he plays well. He's not Boston's traditional center archetype as a rim-runner rather than a shooter, but the Celtics have so much shooting still in place that he should be able to benefit from plenty of easy buckets. And there's one unusual candidate that I want to mention. In our MVP odds preview, I mentioned Alperen Sengun as a 300-to-1 long shot I liked. For the same reasons, I want his MIP odds at +10000. One of Houston's young players is about to take a big leap just by virtue of the extra touches available without Fred VanVleet. We covered Amen Thompson already. Well, if you're a Thompson bettor, you basically have to hedge Sengun as well in case he's the one who shines in VanVleet's absence. Sengun was one of the best players at EuroBasket, drawing notable comparisons to Nikola Jokić. It's not likely as he's already made an All-Star Game, but there's a world in which he takes a very significant, All-NBA leap, and there are voters who tend to reward that sort of leap. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers used his Monday pregame press conference to express his frustrations with the mass arrests being conducted by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago. The Bucks were preparing to play the Bulls in Chicago Sunday night, and as a Chicago native, Rivers felt compelled to speak about the matter. \" It bothers me ,\" Rivers said. \"I'm trying, I'm trying. I mean, it's just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that's not this country. That's not what we're about.\" ICE has been conducting mass arrests across Chicago since early September in a large-scale deportation effort at the direction of President Donald Trump, though a federal judge ruled recently to extend a consent decree that limits ICE's ability to arrest people without warrants or probable cause. Meanwhile, the Defense Department is attempting to send 200 National Guard soldiers from Texas, and another 300 from Illinois, into Chicago to aid ICE across the city. For the time being, the National Guard has been temporarily blocked from deploying in Chicago after the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling from U.S. District Judge April Perry to deny the deployment of the troops, though they temporarily remain under federal control. \"I think [Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson] has done an amazing job with everything he says,\" River said. \"You know, I think this is starting to separate us all, which I hate. This is not, you can be pro-civil rights or what's right and not be, like, anti-white. And I think that's what it's starting to become in some ways. And it shouldn't be. It really shouldn't be. I would hope that if this was Ukrainian immigrants being detained that everyone on both races would fight for it. That's wrong. It's just wrong.\" Rivers continued, \"I think every American is good with if there's criminals on the street, we want to arrest the criminals. My dad [Grady] was a [Maywood] cop for Christ's sakes. My dad would not be proud of this. I know that. My dad would have a major problem. I couldn't imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they're doing. I couldn't imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he'd call in sick. And it's just so – did you walk around the city today? This is an amazing city.\" ICE has been conducting targeted arrests in many neighborhoods across Chicago, primarily in areas with higher numbers of people of color. Protestors have been active outside the ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, where they've clashed with ICE agents, the National Guard and police officers. \"Riding down the elevator with a couple -- I wish I could remember where they're from -- their daughter ran in the marathon and the couple was so proud and they were saying, 'Man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I've never been to this city, wow,'\" Rivers said. \"And the dad says, 'But we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere.' And he was like, 'Where is it?' It's nowhere. It's just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I'm from Chicago. I'm very prideful about this place, so I hate it.\" © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The biggest story in Milwaukee -- and one of the biggest in the NBA -- this offseason has been the \"will he, won't he\" drama surrounding a potential Giannis Antetokounmpo trade request. After another disappointing playoff exit, Antetokounmpo genuinely considered asking out of Milwaukee for the first time in his career, but chose to stick it out for one more season with the Bucks to see if the roster changes can get him closer to competing for another title. The first concrete sign that Giannis was coming back for the 2025-26 season was the Bucks agreeing to a new one-year deal with his brother Thanasis. They went a step further Monday by adding a third Antetokounmpo, signing Alex to a two-way contract, as relayed to Shams Charania by his agent. It's the first time in NBA history that three brothers will all be on the same roster. Thanasis has long been paired with Giannis on the Bucks' roster, and they now are joined by Alex, who spent 2022-24 with their G League affiliate, the Wisconsin Herd. It's a not so subtle effort from the Bucks to make Giannis as comfortable and happy as possible in Milwaukee, as family is extremely important to the Greek star and he'll now have two of his brothers with him for most of the season. Alex will still spend time in the G League, but can be active on the Bucks' main roster for 50 games this season. The lone basketball playing Antetokounmpo brother that is not on the Milwaukee roster right now is Kostas, who last played in the NBA with the Lakers back in the 2020-21 season. Time will tell if Milwaukee's plan of signing as many available Antetokounmpo's pays off in the form of Giannis staying long-term, but they cannot be faulted for trying. That said, Giannis made it clear the most important thing is an opportunity to win a title. If the Bucks make another early playoff exit in 2026, it may not matter how many Antetokounmpos the Bucks sign, the star may re-evaluate his situation next summer and look for a new home. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The NBA is now investigating the latter agreement under claims of salary cap circumvention. The latest reporting on the case comes via Baxter Holmes and Bobby Marks at ESPN and dives into the initial sponsorship deal between the Clippers and Aspiration, a “green bank” company that team owner Steve Ballmer invested $50 million in around the same time. From the report: Two sources with direct knowledge of the arrangement said the Clippers submitted the 23-year agreement to the NBA for approval before it was announced in September 2021, as required under league rules because it contained a jersey patch component, the sources said... “Teams vet their own sponsorship partners and negotiate their own sponsorship agreements,” NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said in a statement to ESPN. “Given the jersey patch’s inclusion on player jerseys and its level of exposure across game telecasts, the league reviews and approves jersey patch arrangements pursuant to league rules that are intended to avoid potential brand issues or conflicts with league partnerships.” The other thing the league looks into is the viability of the company — can it live up to the financial obligations of the sponsorship deal? On paper in 2021, Aspiration looked like it could, which is why Ballmer and other billionaires were investing in it. Within a couple of years, Aspiration had fallen apart, the sponsorship deal with the Clippers had been canceled, the company had filed for bankruptcy, and its CEO Joe Sanberg had pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud. All of this is separate from the allegation that Ballmer and the Clippers used Aspiration and its $48 million endorsement deal with Leonard to skirt the salary cap and get the Clippers star more money, an allegation investigated and made by the Pablo Torre Finds Out podcast . The NBA has hired the law firm of Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate the claim that this was a “no show” endorsement deal — there is no public evidence at this point of Leonard having done any work, made any appearances or done any social media posts for Aspiration — used to circumvent the NBA’s salary cap and get more money to Leonard (and his family, including his uncle and business manager Dennis Rodgers). There is a lot of circumstantial evidence for the Clippers to explain, including Clippers minority owner Dennis Wong investing $2 million in Aspiration in late 2023 — when it was clear the company was failing — and Leonard getting a $1.75 million endorsement check days later. Through all of this, the Clippers and Leonard have vehemently denied any wrongdoing. “I mean, the NBA is going to do their job. None of us did no wrongdoing,” Leonard said at Clippers media day. “And, yeah, I mean, that’s it. We invite the investigation ... I understand that full contract and the services that I had to do. Like I said, I don’t deal with the conspiracies or the clickbait analysts or journalism that’s going on.” That same day, Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank said, “We feel very, very confident we’re on the right side of this.” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said the burden of proof is on the NBA to show there was something amiss. The league’s investigation is expected to last months, very likely into 2026 (the ESPN report suggests it could take until after the 2026 NBA playoffs). Whatever the investigation finds, Silver must bring it to an independent arbitrator — agreed to by the NBA and the players’ union — who will determine the next steps and whether Silver has enough to punish the Clippers or not.

A 6-foot-8, 205-pound forward, Minott earned some well-deserved praise from NBC Sports Boston analyst Brian Scalabrine after the C's earned a win over the Cavaliers on Sunday.

His energy is infectious.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Minott is averaging 12.3 points and shooting better than 50 percent from the field through three preseason games. He's added 6.3 rebounds on average and stuffed the stat sheet with a total of five steals and two blocks in three contests. \"He's making things happen on both sides of the ball,\" Scalabrine said. \"That's all the things that this team is going to need. Hard-playing guys that have a ton of confidence. Minott fits that bill.\" The 22-year-old spent the last three seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves where he averaged 2.3 points and 1.0 rebounds in five minutes per game.

I'm just doing what Joe expects me to do, trying to muck up the game, make it harder on the opposing offense.\" When the regular season tips off, Minott might not receive the same 20-plus minutes he's received during the preseason. The Celtics have some depth on the wing behind Jaylen Brown. Minott, though, could carve out an impactful every night role if he continues to play the same way he is now."}

You can’t win your league in the first two rounds, but you can certainly set yourself up for success. Pairing two players that fit together is vital and will influence every pick for the rest of your draft in category leagues as you establish a build. Using Yahoo ADP to determine the first 12 picks, I went through and drafted the best player to pair with them in round two. Since every draft will be different, I’ll also mention other options to consider, but the focus here will be on the best fit based on who is available, if all things go according to how I think they should. The pairing may not have led to a championship for the Suns, but now that they’re no longer on the same team, they can make things work for you in fantasy. Booker should see a jump in production with Durant and Bradley Beal gone, and KD should help make up for any of Book’s inefficiencies. Both can provide well-rounded production while being among the league leaders in points, which gives you plenty of flexibility for the rest of your draft. Other options: Donovan Mitchell, Stephen Curry, Tyrese Maxey While I’m not a huge fan of taking Sabonis in the first round, starting your team with him and Amen and leaning into punting three-pointers gives you a strong direction. Not many centers provide the rebounds and assists that Sabonis does, and this gives you a strong field goal percentage immediately. Thompson’s defensive production makes up for Sabonis’ lack of steals and blocks, and you’ll have to figure out the free throws in later rounds, but this gives you an elite start in three categories and strong production in a handful more. Other options: Alperen Sengun, Paolo Banchero, Jalen Williams There aren’t many players that provide elite production in points, assists, free throws and threes like Young can. Of course, Harden is one of those players, and both have been able to provide at least one steal per game for a while, which helps. Both turn the ball over a ton and miss a ton of shots, which means it would be best to go ahead and punt those two categories; it probably isn’t worth your time to try and make up for those weaknesses. However, you can be dominant in a handful of categories. Other options: Donovan Mitchell, Domantas Sabonis, Stephen Curry Under Mike Brown, Towns could take a hit in production if he spends more time playing alongside Mitchell Robinson, specifically on the glass. However, he’ll remain efficient and one of the best sources of three-pointers at the center spot. Add in the greatest shooter in league history, who is also able to provide value in a handful of other categories. Towns is a poor shot blocker for a center, so leaning into that as a punt build would be a good idea. Other options: Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell AD doesn’t hit many threes, but he’s elite elsewhere. Pairing him with Mobley, who is also a decent passer for a big, sets you up for a nice build if you’re willing to punt triples and free throw percentage. Pairing these two bigs gives you dominance on the glass and defensively without setting you back in points and assists, which is difficult to find early on in your draft. Other options: Chet Holmgren, Amen Thompson, Jalen Johnson Cunningham enjoyed a breakout season last year, with his main weakness being turnovers. Insert Mitchell, who doesn’t turn the ball over quite as much, but still provides plenty of points, rebounds, assists and threes. Mitchell is coming off a down season, but his bounce back should fit nicely next to Cade. Checking points and assists off this early is a great start. Other options: Domantas Sabonis, Jalen Williams, Tyrese Maxey Edwards adds something new every season, and last year, he became one of the most prolific shooters in the league. He provided dominant value in points and threes and was still decent everywhere else, aside from field goal percentage. Combining him with Maxey works well; the 76ers guard had a poor field goal percentage as well, but he provided elite points, threes, assists and steals. Starting with these two guards is an elite pairing to begin your draft. Other options: Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Jalen Brunson Everyone knows how dominant Giannis can be, and his limitations are obvious; he isn’t going to provide threes, and he’s going to miss a ton of free throws. Johnson, who has been a subpar shooter, isn’t reliant on those categories to be a monster in fantasy. Pairing Giannis, who should be more productive than ever this season without as much help, with Johnson, who appears to be ready to take yet another step forward, gives you a clear direction for the rest of your draft. Other options: Amen Thompson, Paolo Banchero, Domantas Sabonis Doncic provides dominant points, rebounds, assists and threes. Sengun gives you a big man that helps in three of those four categories. Both are subpar free throw shooters and pretty average providers of defensive stats. Sengun fits like a glove next to Luka, and everything from this offseason indicates that the Houston center could take a massive leap forward this year. Other options: Jalen Williams, Paolo Banchero, Kevin Durant SGA and JDub are an excellent fit on the court for the Thunder, and the same can be said in fantasy basketball. Both are well-rounded, which gives you a lot of flexibility for the rest of your draft. SGA is obviously one of the best players in fantasy basketball, so adding a player that doesn’t take away from any of his strengths, such as shooting percentages and steals, just helps make him more valuable. Other options: Tyrese Maxey, Jalen Johnson, Amen Thompson Why not pair one unicorn with another? Starting with these two basically gives you a win in blocks every week, but they’re both dynamic enough to still provide value in other categories and not have a clear weakness early on in your draft. Of course, you can’t really go wrong with anyone when you start with Wemby, which is why he’s a consensus top-three pick. Holmgren’s hip injury last season really limited his production, but being healthy to start this season should help him bounce back. Other options: Evan Mobley, Jalen Williams, Scottie Barnes You can’t go wrong when you start with Jokic. His well-rounded dominance allows you to build your team however you want. I’m not a huge fan of taking Banchero this early, but with a few of my other favorite options taken at this point, I think there’s a case to be made. Jokic makes up for Banchero’s shooting percentage limitations, and it leans into points, rebounds and assists, which are the strongest parts of Jokic’s game. But again, this one isn’t as strict; you can pair Jokic with anyone. Other options: Jalen Williams, Alperen Sengun, really anyone"}

Alex is the youngest of the five Antetokounmpo brothers, and will join both Giannis and Thanasis on the Bucks. It’s the first time in league history that three brothers have been on the same team at the same time. Alex briefly spent time in the G League after going undrafted in 2021. He had short runs with the Raptors 905 and the Wisconsin Herd before returning to Europe. He averaged 1.2 points and 1.1 rebounds in 14 games with PAOK in Greece last season. Thanasis, the second-oldest brother, has been on the Bucks for the past five seasons, though he missed all of last year due to a torn Achilles. He signed a one-year, $2.9 million deal to return to the franchise this past offseason. [ Get more Bucks news: Milwaukee team feed ] Kostas Antetokounmpo spent three seasons in the league, and won a title with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, though he has spent the last several seasons in Europe. Francis, the oldest brother, was a professional soccer player. Giannis, the middle brother and two-time league MVP, averaged 30.4 points and 11.9 rebounds per game last season while picking up his ninth consecutive All-Star nod. He has been the subject of trade rumors in recent years, and again this past offseason after the Bucks fell in the first round of the playoffs. There was a report that the Bucks engaged in trade talks about him with the New York Knicks recently, but Giannis shut that down and insisted that he wanted to be in Milwaukee for the time being. While Alex will end up spending time with the Herd this year, having two of his brothers by his side in Milwaukee this season is sure to help keep Giannis happy regardless of how the season goes. The Bucks, who went 48-34 last season, will open the year Oct. 22 against the Washington Wizards."}

This is the first time in NBA history that three brothers have been active on the same roster at the same time. Milwaukee is familiar with Alex, who was with the team’s G-League affiliate, the Wisconsin Herd, for two seasons, from 2022 to 2024.

Across all sports, I am generally not a big fan of preseason futures. To me, sports betting is one giant math equation and my primary source of income. The return on investment needed to outweigh churning a bankroll for the six-plus months of a season is a difficult proposition to justify. The risk vs. reward ratio matched up against simply investing the same money in other financial markets without a complete loss factor generally makes it unwise. The theoretical hold of many futures betting markets is 1.5-2 times higher than single-game markets. That has always made no sense to me — if the sportsbook gets to keep my wager pending for multiple months instead of multiple hours — I believe the margins for the house should decrease and not increase. With all that said, though, I absolutely love betting NBA win totals. Win-total betting mitigates a lot of the concerns of most futures markets — and there are large and quantifiable edges to obtain. Let’s address why these markets are worth betting into, and then let’s talk about the three most obvious teams to target. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Right now at BetMGM , you'll see the same odds on NBA win totals as you do on normal NBA games: -110 on both sides of the ledger. That means the theoretical market hold — a nerdy gambling term to describe a book's expected rake rate — is the exact same as game-to-game betting. When betting player awards and title winners, the large payouts look nice but the back-end math is less kind to the bettor. The next factor is “outs,” or different places to enter the market. Win-total markets remain up pretty much all season. A bettor can re-position, double down, hedge out or open a middle with relative ease. Juxtapose this with trying to bet some awards, and hedging becomes messy with multiple other options and unclear award criteria. Lastly, these bets are generally the fastest to process of any futures market. Once a team automatically hits either the over by exceeding its win total with multiple games left, or mathematically hits the under, the bet can cash toward the end of the regular season. Player awards are announced during the playoffs and title winners have to wait until mid-June, so getting that bankroll back in early April factors into the equation. So where should we put our money for this upcoming 2025-2026 NBA season? Last season, the Raptors were ATS darlings. They ranked second in the NBA only behind the title-winning Oklahoma City Thunder against the spread, covering over 59% of their games (48-33-1). Considering they were so often priced as underdogs and only had 30 wins, they showed they were able to hang with teams of all caliber relative to market expectations. This was in large part due to an impressive young coach in Darko Rajaković and a deep roster of young, talented players. This offseason they made the transition from being a development team to a team intending to win, and the win-totals market does not fully reflect that yet. Toronto added Brandon Ingram and re-signed him to an extension. The Raptors also re-signed Jakob Poeltl, a stable starting center who is impressive on defense, setting screens and is an elite passer. Toronto also drafted one of the most pro-ready prospects in Collin Murray-Boyles from South Carolina. The starting five likely looks like: Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett, Ingram, Scottie Barnes and Poeltl, while bringing in sharp-shooter Gradey Dick off the bench. This is a really improved team in a weak Eastern Conference. I think the Raptors' ceiling can be as a top-six seed, missing the play-in all together and being an outright playoff team. I am playing their win total over, their odds to make the playoffs and even some further long shots. I love the Raptors' prospects this season. Bet: Over 37.5 wins In an era when offensive output drives regular-season winning, the Blazers doubled down on defense this offseason. They traded one of their most potent scorers for the aging and defensive-minded Jrue Holiday. They bought out Deandre Ayton, who does provide an offensive boost, only to give his minutes to Donovan Clingan — a very defensive-oriented center, and they'll play rookie center Yang Hansen and let him learn from his mistakes. Lastly, they put together a really nice midseason run in late January into early February when the team went 10-1. But if we look back further, since Jan. 1 they went 25-25. Their big run was more anomalous than anything else. However, the ownership group was re-energized, it re-signed coach Chauncey Billups in what I think was the wrong decision, and decided to run it back with a very similar cast. This team will not be a play-in contender and will not keep pace in the Western Conference. Bet: Under 35.5 wins The Suns are one of the three teams that lost the most national TV games for this season. That makes sense with the trade of Kevin Durant and the buyout of Bradley Beal, but the pricing in the betting market reflects those changes — and perhaps a little too much. Phoenix finally has two centers to fill some of the defensive gaps after trading for Mark Williams at the deadline and drafting Khaman Maluach. Jordan Ott takes over the head-coaching duties, and early reports are very positive about some of his offensive innovation. I think Ott will be able to get the most out of Jalen Green, who never quite fit in with the Houston Rockets. [ Check out all of Yahoo's sports betting content here in our new betting hub ] Devin Booker has thrived in point guard duties in the past and now is flanked by Green and Dillon Brooks, two players who are surprisingly capable as catch-and-shoot players. Brooks was vastly improved as a shooter last season and shot 39.7% on a solid 6.3 attempts per game from 3-point range, which is actually borderline elite. Even a slight regression still has Brooks as a very capable and reliable shooter now. Last year this team had star power, but it was redundant because each key piece aimed to fill the same role; now it is more balanced and will be a more well-rounded roster. I don't think the Suns will win close to 50 games, but I very much like them to go over their win total. Bet: Over 31.5 wins"}

Continuity is boring. At least to many NBA fans it is — player movement is the lifeblood of the sport. The more the better. It’s what drives ratings and draws eyeballs. This offseason saw a lot of players switch teams, but which of those moves will matter? Who are the players who changed teams that will have the biggest impact? Here are seven names to watch — and in the case of a few, we have fantasy basketball notes from our Rotoworld crew on how these moves can affect your teams. This was obviously the biggest player move of the offseason — 73% of NBA GMs voted Durant as the player acquisition that will make the biggest impact this season. Anyone who watched Houston last season — especially during their first-round playoff exit at the hands of the Warriors — realizes that for all the young athletes on their roster, the Rockets’ halfcourt offense needed help. Enter Kevin Durant. He is a walking halfcourt offense. He’s one of the best pure shooters and scorers ever to play the game. As evidence, even in a down year in Phoenix last season, he averaged 26.6 points, shot 43% from 3-point range, plus grabbed six rebounds and dished out 4.2 assists a night. Durant is the guy the Rockets can run off a screen, get him the rock, and watch it rain buckets. The only question is how much playmaking will fall to Durant with point guard Fred VanVleet out with a torn ACL? While Amen Thompson and Reed Sheppard are playing the point and initiating the offense, it seems likely that Durant will handle much more of the shot creation than initially expected. He can handle it, but the Rockets are going to be better in the halfcourt with him off the ball. Raphielle Johnson , Rotoworld : Durant has long been an elite fantasy option, with the lone question mark being availability. He played at least 60 games in each of his two full seasons with the Suns, which should bode well for his run with the Rockets. Add in Fred VanVleet’s torn ACL, and this may be a spot where Durant is asked to take on a little more of the playmaking responsibilities to supplement Amen Thompson, Alperen Şengün and Reed Sheppard. Durant may not have a first-round ADP currently, but don’t be surprised if he returns first-round value again in 2025-26. The only more natural fit than KD in Houston this offseason was Desmond Bane going to Orlando — 17% of NBA GMs thought this was the most impactful offseason move, and it was voted the best under-the-radar acquisition by those same GMs. The Magic lack shooting and need a bit more shot creation next to Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. They get that in Bane — a career 41% shooter from beyond the arc — without giving up defense. Orlando is ready to win now, and spending to get Bane is the best sign that they are looking to take a big step forward in the East. This was the surprise move of the offseason for a couple of reasons. First, because Turner was a key part of Indiana’s run to the Finals, why would ownership try to take a hard line on what they would offer one of the better stretch fives in the league? However, that surprise was nothing compared to the shock of the Bucks waiving and stretching more than $100 million of Damian Lillard’s salary, then using that savings to sign Turner. For the Bucks, at this point in their careers, Turner is an upgrade at center over Brook Lopez — but the pressure will be on him to do more. The entire league is watching Giannis Antetokounmpo and his mood, and if Turner isn’t ready to be the No. 2 on this team and have them top five in the East, things get interesting. Noah Rubin , Rotoworld : Myles Turner left Indiana after a decade with the Pacers to join the Bucks, and he’ll fill out the starting center role that Brook Lopez occupied for most of the past seven seasons. During the last few years, Lopez was an elite source of three-pointers and blocks, while playing next to Giannis Antetokounmpo made up for his lack of rebounding prowess. Now insert Turner, who has similar statistical strengths and weaknesses. It’s a flawless fit, but the Bucks didn’t make many other moves this summer, which means Turner will likely be made more of a priority on offense. The 37-year-old Lopez played 31.8 minutes per game last season, which would be a career-high for Turner. He could easily be in for one of his most productive seasons. For my money, this was one of the best pickups of the offseason. Denver doesn’t give up anything on offense — Johnson put up 18.8 points a game last season while shooting 39% from 3, MPJ averaged 18.2 points and hit 39.5% from beyond the arc — but the Nuggets get a better defender and a more consistent player. Johnson is fast going to be a favorite of Nikola Jokic and Nuggets fans. Raphielle Johnson , Rotoworld : Johnson and Michael Porter Jr. produced similar scoring numbers last season. However, while the latter was the superior rebounder, Johnson’s abilities as a supplementary playmaker and defender may make him a better fit on a Nuggets team that hopes to win another championship. If the three-pointers are falling, Johnson can provide reliable middle-round value with a puncher’s chance of cracking the top 50 in fantasy value. However, he’s a player who is more “high floor” than “high ceiling” from a fantasy standpoint. No team made a bigger bet on a player this offseason than Atlanta on Porzingis (except maybe Turner in Milwaukee). Atlanta needed a better rim protector in the paint and a pick-and-pop partner to pair with Trae Young. Porzingis is that, and he paired with the Hawks’ other offseason additions (Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luke Kennard) and getting Jalen Johnson back healthy, this is a Hawks team dreaming of a top-four seed in the East. However, that dream hinges on Porzingis being healthy. He played in just 42 games last season, partly due to a mysterious virus (which he is reportedly over), and he has played in 65+ games twice in his 10-year NBA career. Atlanta needs him to do that again and be healthy for the playoffs. Noah Rubin , Rotoworld : After two seasons in Boston, Kristaps Porzingis was traded to the Hawks for pennies on the dollar. He battled a strange illness during the playoffs last year, and while health is certainly still a concern, Porzingis is an excellent fit next to Trae Young in Atlanta. They’ll likely manage his minutes and games played, but he’s had plenty of fantasy success without needing to play a heavy role. His floor-spacing ability at his size is going to open up driving lanes for both Trae and Jalen Johnson, and the entire offense will thrive as a result. This team has a chance to be incredibly dangerous in the East, and Porzingis’ fit is a big part of that. He’s also dynamic enough to share the floor with Onyeka Okongwu at times, which will allow both bigs to enjoy strong seasons. From the moment they traded for Luka Doncic, the Lakers started looking for a screen-setting, rim-running big man on offense who can also protect the paint on defense. They have signed Ayton, who has been those things in the past — he was the starting center on Phoenix’s Finals team in 2021 — but has not always been consistent. “He is gonna have a lot of responsibility this year for things that we want to do,” Austin Reaves said of Ayton after Sunday night’s preseason win over the Warriors. “If we want to be as good as we think we can be, we need him to be at his best, whatever that looks like.” The Lakers have bet big this year that his best looks a lot like it did in Phoenix a few years back — he’s averaged 7.3 points and 7.7 rebounds, plus 1.7 blocks a game and seems to be finding his way this preseason — and if it does the Lakers will have found their big man (and Ayton will have set himself up for a nice payday next summer). Raphielle Johnson , Rotoworld : While Ayton has plenty of talent, he’s also an occasionally maddening player due to inconsistent energy. After two seasons in Portland on a team that did not have postseason ambitions, he joins forces with Luka Dončić and LeBron James on a Lakers team that will always be in the spotlight. Subpar performances won’t go ignored, and Ayton is at a pivotal point in his NBA career. He’s capable of providing top-75 fantasy value, if not higher, but the “light” has to remain on at all times. Whether the Lakers can truly contend will depend on that. It feels like cheating to choose the No. 1 pick for this list (he did technically change teams from Duke to Dallas), but in a season that starts without Kyrie Irving for the Mavs, Flagg could have a massive impact. Flagg’s defense and all-around game can help Dallas not just make the playoffs this season but even make some noise once there. He’s not going to be Luka Doncic out of the gate, but he can give Mavericks fans hope they can get back to the heights of this franchise. Bonus name: Norman Powell (Miami) , via Noah Rubin , Rotoworld : To start last season, Norman Powell was incredibly productive as one of the primary sources of offense for the Clippers with Kawhi Leonard sidelined. Now, he enters a similar situation, with Tyler Herro (ankle) out to start the season. Powell should get off to a hot start, and even after Herro returns, the Heat will still need Powell’s offense to remain competitive. He was pushing for an All-Star appearance in the West last year, but in the East, he may actually be able to do it this season. Coming off the best season of his career, Powell may be able to replicate that production, and perhaps even improve on it. A Division of NBCUniversal .

The inaugural NBA High Score Creator Cup draft is officially in the books , and let me tell you, it was a ride. Competing in a fantasy basketball format that rewards rebounds, assists, and defensive stats (1 point per point/rebound, 2 for assists, 3 for stocks), managers in this 10-team league navigated a scoring system that values versatility and efficiency over pure scoring volume. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Going into it, I thought I had a solid plan. Then the draft started, and, well, you know how it goes. Everyone's strategy gets thrown into a blender. Let's break down what happened with some insights on how the draft unfolded. Frontcourt players commanded the early spotlight, with 33 of the first 50 picks coming from F/C-eligible players. While I've been preaching that guards are more valuable, I may have underestimated how the High Score format’s requirement for filling three starting frontcourt slots created a scarcity that influenced early picks. Beyond elite anchors like Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Victor Wembanyama, managers quickly targeted bigs who contribute across the stat sheet. Evan Mobley (15th overall), Alperen Şengün (17th overall), Chet Holmgren (24th overall) and Kristaps Porziņģis (25th overall) were all snatched up in the top 30 for their blend of scoring, blocks, boards and passing. Even oft-injured players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Joel Embiid and Kawhi Leonard went in Round 5, indicating that this league understood how capturing discounted frontcourt players offers some boom potential when healthy. In total, the draft leaned slightly toward frontcourt players — 53 F/Cs versus 47 Guards — reflecting the positional weight of this format. Yet, a pivot occurred after Round 5. The back half of the draft saw managers target guards more evenly, hunting for scorers, ball-handlers, and flex-eligible depth to complement their early frontcourt foundations. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Nine of 10 teams selected at least one dual-eligible G/F/C player, offering flexibility that becomes vital over the course of the season. These multi-position contributors — such as Jaylen Brown, Desmond Bane, Scottie Barnes, Paul George and Shaedon Sharpe — bring lineup adaptability along with well-rounded stat lines. There are 22 players with dual eligibility in the High Score Top 150, and below is the distribution of dual-threat players who were drafted in the High Score Creator Cup. The Dream Team notably stood alone without a dual-eligible pick, banking on positional consistency and health across their guards and bigs. Sidebar : I thought Dream Team took the most contrarian approach to their draft strategy, taking several players like Porziņģis (Round 3), Ace Bailey (Round 4) and Aaron Gordon (Round 5) well ahead of their ADPs. Across 10 rounds, the positional rhythm of the draft revealed intentional roster construction. While F/Cs dominated the early rounds (including a 90% frontcourt surge in Round 5), the final five rounds (Rounds 6–10) saw a near-even split — 26 F/Cs and 24 Guards — as teams adjusted to their roster needs and the remaining player pool. Managers used these later rounds to scoop up secondary guards, dual-eligible wings and injury stashes. Scoring guards like Anfernee Simons, Jordan Poole and Cam Thomas, versatile wings like Alex Sarr and Bennedict Mathurin, and lottery-ticket breakout players like Matas Buzelis and Jaden Ivey highlighted the value-hunting process. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Perhaps most impactful, however, was the use of injured list+ roster spots to stash premium injured talent. Kyrie Irving (Round 8), Paul George (Round 8), Dejounte Murray (Round 9) and Jayson Tatum (Round 10) were drafted with a clear long-view in mind — a willingness to sacrifice short-term production for high-upside reinforcements (possibly) later in the season. These picks showcase a sophisticated layer of draft thinking: in High Score formats, late-round value isn't just about breakout bets — it's about strategic patience. Should you endure injuries along the way, there is no shortage of viable replacement-level options available on waivers. To get a taste of how vast the waiver pool is in a standard 10-team High Score league (meaning 100 total players are drafted), here is the list of players over 80% rostered who were not selected in the Creator Cup draft: Mark Williams - F/C, Phoenix Suns Christian Braun - G/FC, Denver Nuggets Donovan Clingan - F/C, Portland Trail Blazers Jakob Poeltl - F/C, Toronto Raptors John Collins - F/C, Los Angeles Clippers Cameron Johnson -F/C, Denver Nuggets Jalen Suggs - G, Orlando Magic Onyeka Okongwu- F/C, Atlanta Hawks Devin Vassell - G/F/C, San Antonio Spurs Overall, it was a great draft that didn't disappoint.

In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Who are the top No. 1 options?", "body": "Manage your account ... Anyone can list the best players in the NBA, but basketball is as much about chemistry as it is talent. Within each of the league's 30 teams is a hierarchy, and how well each of the five players on the court understands and performs his role within that hierarchy is every bit as important as his individual skill. While depth was vital to the success of the Thunder and Pacers last season, and we understand coaches often say, \"It's about who closes the game; not who starts it,\" the pursuit of a roster's most cohesive five-man unit is still paramount. Three of last year's top four starting lineups on our list — the Thunder, Knicks and Timberwolves — reached the conference finals. In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Ideally, a lineup has its superstar, a deferential co-star, a third star who owns his role, a fourth option and a fifth starter to tie it all together — clear Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. How close does your team come to an ideal lineup? What is a No. 1? Here is how we described him last year: He is the team's alpha — often by personality, always by ability. Ideally, everyone recognizes he is the squad's top dog; teammates fall in line behind him, and opponents make him the primary focus of their game plans. Clutch situations typically run through a No. 1. He settles you down when you are on the wrong end of a run. He bails you out if possessions go haywire. He gets his. He comes in many forms, but you know him when you see him. King James or The Hick from French Lick. Air Jordan or The Chairman of the Boards. Magic Johnson or The Big Fundamental. In whatever form, he is in pursuit of the pantheon, for you cannot be an all-timer as a No. 2. Let me add: His alpha-ness can include defense. This isn't just about being a No. 1 scoring option. His offense should be somewhat commensurate with that defense — enough for his teammates to trust in him — but this is about the total package of a player. How much does he wield his influence on a game? [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] This is also about projecting where that player is going to land by season's end. Which is why you might be surprised by how high Victor Wembanyama is ranked on this list. It is difficult, then, to rank, say, Wembanyama against Stephen Curry, given their ages and impact on either side of the ball. Subjectivity creeps into every list, so you'll just have to trust us — or argue with us . That is the fun of this exercise. Lastly, we sourced these lineups and each player's status within them with beat reporters around the league. We appreciate everyone who casted a roster; there are too many people to thank in this space. And we recognize that not every player listed here will be in an opening-night starting lineup. Injuries occur. Coaches change their minds. But just know that this is our best guess at the rotations we will likely see most often from each team. Without further ado, your five best No. 1s ... Jokić is almost universally considered the game's best player. He has finished either first or second in the NBA's MVP race each of the past five years, winning the honor three times and sprinkling in a Finals MVP award in between. Whether or not he wins the award each season is more dependent on his team's effort than his own, and the Nuggets have retooled in a way that should maximize his performance this season. As it were, Jokić averaged a 30-point triple-double last season, ranking among the league's top three in points, rebounds and assists per game. Oh, and he ranked second in steals per game, top 10 in field-goal percentage and top 20 in 3-point percentage. He was the best in the NBA among ball-dominant stars in true shooting percentage, player efficiency rating, box plus/minus and value over replacement player. Statistically, at least, there is no argument for anyone but Jokić here, and it feels that way, too. Denver was 21.3 points per 100 meaningful possessions better when he was on the court than when he was off of it, according to Cleaning the Glass , best among anyone who played more than 150 minutes last season. What a season Gilgeous-Alexander enjoyed in 2024-25. The 27-year-old point guard won the league's MVP award, leading the Thunder to 68 victories — only the seventh team ever to win that many games — and a championship, tacking on a Finals MVP honor. His ascent up the all-time rankings is on a steep incline. Only 10 players in history have ever won the regular-season and Finals MVP awards in the same season. Oklahoma City outscored opponents by 12.8 points per 100 possessions last season, second only to Michael Jordan's 72-win 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, and Gilgeous-Alexander was the driving force. He can, for the most part, get whatever shot he wants, carving into the lane, shifting and grifting his way to baskets and free throws in bunches. His 32.7 points per game led the league last season by a wide margin, and his PER (30.7) was, likewise, second among guards only to Jordan (who eclipsed SGA's PER four times). When anyone finds himself in the same conversation as Jordan this much, he deserves to at least be the No. 1 guard listed here, and oddsmakers currently give him their edge (again) over Jokić in the MVP race. No team needs its superstar this season more than the Bucks need Antetokounmpo. He has earned his way onto the All-NBA first team in each of the past seven seasons, finishing top four in the MVP voting every year, including third in three of the past four seasons. (He won the award in both 2019 and 2020.) Milwaukee lost Damian Lillard to an Achilles injury in last season's playoffs, waived and stretched the remaining two years of his contract and replaced him with Myles Turner in free agency. The rest of the roster leaves plenty to be desired, but Antetokounmpo alone should put them in the playoff discussion. He is that good, averaging a 30-12-6 since the start of the 2018-19 campaign. Nobody gets to the rim as often as he does. He is a wrecking ball, and godspeed to anyone who stands between him and the basket in the open court. And did we mention that he also has a Defensive Player of the Year award to his name? Dončić was second on this list a year ago, if only because he was coming off a trip to the NBA Finals with the Dallas Mavericks. Last season was a wild one for Dončić, who was traded to the Lakers, for whom his health and defense remained concerns. (By no means is this a vote of confidence in Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison's decision to trade Dončić. The 26-year-old is en route to becoming an all-timer.) Still, there is also some lingering concern about Dončić's fit with LeBron James as co-superstars on a team starved for defense, both because of their overlapping ball-dominant skill sets and different ages. The news of the 40-year-old's sciatica , which could cost him a few weeks, does not inspire confidence. Dončić, though, when healthy — and he looks as fit as ever — is an offensive mastermind, averaging a 30-9-9 over the past six seasons. He made the All-NBA first team for five straight years until failing to qualify for the league's awards last season. He plays at his own pace, either stepping back into 3-pointers or plodding his way to a spot inside the arc, where he can score in a variety of ways or find an open man. His force-of-nature mentality, and the talent around him, will drive the offense to extraordinary heights. Welcome to the top five, Anthony Edwards. He ranked eighth on this list a year ago, and then made a second consecutive trip to the conference finals in the crowded West — with Julius Randle as his co-star in place of Karl-Anthony Towns — firmly supplanting himself as one of the league's fastest-rising stars. Edwards is a three-time All-Star at only 24 years old and has at least another leap left in him. One will happen eventually. And why shouldn't it happen this season? He averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game last season on personal-best efficiency, shooting 40% on 10.3 attempts a night from 3-point range. Only Stephen Curry and James Harden have made more triples in a season than Edwards did in 2024-25. None of this makes mention of Edwards' athleticism, which is second to none. He is as explosive as he is confident, and that is saying something. Much room is left in his game for improvement as a free-throw merchant and as a playmaker. There is a world where he averages north of 30 points per game and plays his way into a more serious MVP conversation, where he has finished seventh each of the past two years. 6.

The defending NBA Champions, Oklahoma City Thunder, travel to Fiserv Forum to face the Milwaukee Bucks for a preseason game Tuesday night on Peacock at 8 p.m. ET. The Thunder dominated the league all last season, winning 68 games in the regular season en route to an NBA Finals victory over the Indiana Pacers in seven games. Star point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won MVP averaging 32.7 points and 6.4 assists per game. Young stars Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren shined in the postseason and earned big contract extensions this summer. Oklahoma City once again features a deep, versatile rotation with Alex Caruso , Isaiah Hartenstein , Luguentz Dort, and Cason Wallace ready to defend their title in 2025-26. The Bucks for the third straight season got knocked out in the first round of the playoffs a year ago after a 48-34 regular season, losing in five games to the aforementioned Pacers. With the Achilles injury to Damian Lillard forcing him off the floor for the foreseeable future, the Bucks’ front office used every trick in the book to maximize this year’s roster while still having a top three player across the league in Giannis Antetokounmpo. Milwaukee waived and stretched Lillard’s contract, the largest amount of money to stretch in league history, to sign former Pacers center Myles Turner in free agency. Other key players include Kevin Porter Jr. , A.J Green , Gary Trent Jr. , and Bobby Portis to provide perimeter shooting around Giannis.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 50-32 (third in the West, lost to the Timberwolves in the first round) Offensive rating : 115 (11th) Defensive rating : 113.8 (17th) Additions : Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, Jake LaRavia Subtractions : Dorian Finney-Smith, Jordan Goodwin, Shake Milton Complete roster It is beyond cool that 40-year-old LeBron James, one of the greatest players in history, is on the same roster as Luka Dončić, one of the most decorated young players the NBA has ever seen. It is impossible not to think of their Lakers as a great team, if only because in our minds the two of them are that good. Whether they make practical sense as a championship duo is another matter. James is currently suffering from sciatica on his right side , which will cost him the start of the season. This is not news that inspires much confidence in James' ability to hold up his end of that bargain between two max-salaried co-stars. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Meanwhile, Dončić is a 26-year-old who appears to be in the best shape of his life . One makes sense to build around. The other? He will be, at some point soon — if not now — just hoping the bottom doesn't fall out on his career. As difficult as it may be, the Lakers have to consider whether it is wise to spend any more of Dončić's prime investing in the chance that James could still be who Dončić needs him to be. Already, James is no longer the defensive stalwart he once was, not even close, and Dončić has never been known for his defense. Offensively, there is also a ton of overlap among their skill sets as ball-dominant superstars. There is reason for skepticism — reason to ask: Can they still maximize each other? They are, of course, also two of the greatest offensive minds the game has ever seen, and they will figure a lot of things out. They will win a lot of games, so long as James can get healthy, but can they win a title? The defense is a hindrance to that goal. Their third-best player, Austin Reaves, is no stopper. Nor is Deandre Ayton. The Lakers did sign one-time Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart, but at age 31 he has not displayed the same on-ball dynamism he once did. This is going to be a porous defensive team. They ranked 17th on that end last season and lost Dorian Finney-Smith, their best defensive player. Remember: Dončić and James took the floor together in the first round of last season's playoffs, losing in five games as favorites to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Los Angles did little to address its fatal flaw. The Dallas Mavericks built a team of two-way talents around Dončić and Kyrie Irving to reach the 2024 NBA Finals. The Lakers will eventually have do the same around Dončić in L.A., but they have not done that. Reaves and Ayton have a lot of potential between them, but little of it is on the defensive end. In Dončić's case, there is time to fix this. He is entering his prime and signed a three-year, $160.8 million contract extension. James does not have any of those luxuries. He will turn 41 years old in December, his contract expires at the end of this season, and we have no idea when Father Time will come for James. If, indeed, it becomes clear that this roster is not one with which Dončić can win a championship, what do the Lakers do? Do they try to reconfigure it around Dončić and James on the fly in the narrow window that they have together, dealing a 27-year-old Reaves and draft picks in search of two-way contributors? That has a real possibility of backfiring. Make moves in desperation, and the Lakers could easily find themselves in a post-LeBron era without any flexibility on the trade market, trying to field a competitive team around Dončić. Take a step back, and the plan becomes much clearer: Focus on Dončić — now. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] Build around him the way you would around a young James, and you know what a young James would do? Trade the 40-year-old aging superstar whose $52.6 million salary is a deterrent to building a title team around its best player. That, or let him walk in free agency at season's end, freeing up the kind of salary cap space that could be committed to a more age-appropriate playing partner in Los Angeles. This is L.A., after all, and these are the Lakers. Someone will want to join Dončić on this ride. It is unclear if James even wants to be that guy, as his agent, Rich Paul, issued the following cryptic statement in June: \"We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage of his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.\" What is best for James may not be what is best for Dončić, and the Lakers will soon have to choose sides. What that looks like in the short-term is anyone's guess, but one of their superstars is just beginning his L.A. story, while the other is scripting its end. Threading the needle between them may be a fool's errand. Skinny Luka Dončić is the frontrunner for MVP. James remains healthy and conditioned when he returns, and in the playoffs. Smart is the Smart of old, wreaking havoc on both ends of the court. Ayton reverts to the player he was for the Phoenix Suns, anchoring a contender. The Lakers find some gems among the hodgepodge of Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent, Dalton Knecht, Jake LaRavia, Jaxson Hayes, Maxi Kleber and Jarred Vanderbilt. And they are capable of actually challenging anyone in the West (and, as such, anyone in the league) in a seven-game series. This is LeBron James and Luka Dončić, after all. It becomes immediately clear that this version of the Lakers — the one with defensive holes throughout its roster — is no contender. JJ Redick cannot coach this team up. James recognizes that and makes it known through his intermediaries. He wants out, the Lakers concede, only it is difficult to find a team that a) wants to acquire a max-salaried 40-year-old and b) is willing to give up real assets to get him. Chemistry frays, and the Lakers fail to make the playoffs in a crowded Western Conference. Back to square one at season's end, which is not such a bad place to be when Dončić is your starting point. Season opener : Oct. 21 vs. Golden State Complete schedule At some point the wheels come off. At some point James can no longer meet the demands of a max salary.

Detroit managed to check all those boxes in head coach J.B. Bickerstaff’s first year on the bench. Aided by general manager Trajan Langdon importing several legitimate shooters to space the floor for his forays into the paint, cornerstone lead guard Cade Cunningham blossomed into a first-time All-Star and All-NBA selection. The influx of some steadier veterans in front of burly young centers Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart — combined with the emergence of all-world possession-wrecker Ausar Thompson — helped transform what had been one of the league’s worst defenses into one that ranked in or just outside the top 10 in points allowed per possession, opponent field goal percentage, defensive rebounding rate, turnover creation, and preventing opportunities at the rim and in transition. And as far as the physicality goes … well, with Stewart, Duren, Thompson, rookie Ron Holland, et al., in tow, Detroit definitely didn’t duck any smoke. The Pistons rode that recipe to their best season in a decade, a return to the postseason, and a brutally hard-fought first-round series against the Knicks — one they lost in six games, with three of the losses coming without primary interior deterrent Stewart , three coming by one possession, and one coming under, shall we say, contested circumstances: After that taste of playoff competition, and the bitter taste left in their mouths by Jalen Brunson and Co. , the Pistons enter a new season intent on continuing their upward mobility in a conference where three of the five teams that finished ahead of them last season — the Celtics, Pacers and Bucks — were rocked by devastating injuries and roster reorganizations. Progress isn’t always linear, though; there’s plenty of hard work to be done for Detroit to build on last season’s breakthrough. As brilliant as Cunningham was during a campaign that saw him finish seventh in the NBA in scoring , fourth in assists and points created via assist , and fifth in triple-doubles , the 24-year-old must improve his interior finishing (just 57% at the rim ) if he wants to reach the elevated levels of elite offensive engines like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Dončić. One of the NBA’s most ball-dominant players must take better care of it, too: Detroit’s chances of posting its first top-10 offense since 2008 could rest on how effectively Cunningham can curb his turnovers (4.4 per game, second-most in the league ) and whether his teammates can follow suit to improve on last season’s bottom-10 finish in turnover frequency . [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] The dudes flanking Cunningham on the perimeter will have to keep coming through, too. How smooth will the transition be from Sixth Man of the Year runner-up Beasley (who made more 3-pointers than anybody besides Stephen Curry last season before everything went insane this summer ), Hardaway Jr. (who made 77 starts last season) and Schröder (a vital secondary playmaker whom Bickerstaff trusted to the tune of 27 minutes per game in the playoffs) to Caris LeVert, Duncan Robinson and Jaden Ivey, who was off to a fantastic start through 30 games (17.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists in 29.9 minutes per game, shooting 40.9% from 3-point range) before fracturing his left fibula ? Can the 23-year-old Ivey and 21-year-old Duren continue the kind of growth in their critical areas for development — Ivey’s catch-and-shoot game/off-ball work when alongside Cunningham, and the efficiency of his pick-and-roll playmaking when running second units while Cade’s on the bench, and Duren’s understanding of how to guard pick-and-rolls and protect the paint — that will cement them as foundational pieces in Detroit moving forward? As members of the 2022 draft class, both are eligible for extensions right up until opening night; if they don’t reach agreements, both will be ticketed for restricted free agency next summer. Perhaps even more important: After missing the final month of the 2023-24 season and the first month of 2024-25 due to a blood clot issue , is the 22-year-old Thompson ready to make the same kind of leap that his twin brother Amen made last year? After entering the starting lineup in early January, Ausar averaged 16.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 3.9 blocks-and-steals and 5.6 deflections per 36 minutes of floor time, shooting 54.9% from the floor. The Pistons went 26-19 in his 45 starts in that span, a 47-win pace; several advanced metrics, including estimated plus minus , xRAPM and ESPN’s Net Points , evaluate him as one of the five to 10 highest-impact individual defenders in the game. Coming off a healthy offseason in which he reportedly prioritized conditioning, adding strength and knocking down corner 3s, if Thompson’s able to play longer minutes and make more consistent offensive contributions, he could push his brother in the race for Most Improved Player honors. Combine that kind of leap with steady improvement from one of the league’s brightest young cores and steady contributions from both the incoming vets and holdovers like Tobias Harris, and the Pistons might be well on their way to proving that last year’s breakthrough was the beginning of a new run of glory days in the Motor City. [ Get more Pistons news: Detroit team feed ] “We have no chance of going to get a championship without a year like last year,” Cunningham told reporters at Pistons media day. “But there are more steps to be taken after that. I think our minds are just onto the next step, honestly. We’re not into celebrating last year anymore.” Cunningham cements himself as an All-NBA mainstay, Thompson makes that leap, Ivey picks up right where he left off, and Duren looks more comfortable commanding the backline of the defense. The vets keep making shots, Bickerstaff manages the rotation well, and Detroit wins 50 games and hosts a playoff series for the first time since Flip Saunders was coaching Chauncey, Rip, Rasheed and Big Ben. It turns out that Beasley and Hardaway Jr. were load-bearing walls; even if LeVert and Robinson make for a wash talent-wise, their impact on the overall ecosystem isn’t as positive or additive. Slightly worse spacing, slightly worse shooting, slightly less juice and slightly more questions make the margins in which Detroit thrived last year a little bit tighter. That makes it harder for Cade to cook and all the other youngsters to bloom, resulting in a team that dips back toward .500 and the play-in mix — an opportunity squandered in an East in upheaval, and an underwhelming result that muddies the waters a bit when it comes to figuring out which pieces these Pistons should be prioritizing moving forward. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Chicago Complete schedule On one hand, the Pistons won 44 despite Ivey missing 52 games and Thompson missing 23; getting something closer to full seasons from both should push them over comfortably. On the other, though, Detroit also got by far the healthiest and most available season of Cunningham’s career; if he misses time, it’s easy to see the offense cratering and the team going with it. Let’s split the difference and assume regressions in both directions; three more wins in a down conference doesn’t sound too nuts to me.

Midway through the game, Los Angeles center Deandre Ayton stepped to the line for a pair of free throws. After Ayton sank the first, cameras appeared to catch rookie forward Dalton Knecht seemingly trash-talking the Golden State veteran near the paint. Green — never one to back down — quickly fired back.

In the span of just a few days, Dalton Knecht went from being a Los Angeles Laker, to a Charlotte Hornet, and back to a Laker again — all before he’d even unpacked. At the February trade deadline, the Lakers agreed to send Knecht, Cam Reddish, a 2030 pick swap and their 2031 first-round pick to Charlotte in exchange for 7-foot center Mark Williams. But the deal collapsed after Williams reportedly failed his physical, nullifying the trade and sending Knecht back to Los Angeles.

Knecht later told reporters the whirlwind felt “like a movie” — a surreal experience of being traded, traveling to meet his new team, and then returning to the same locker room days later. Green, known for his fiery competitiveness, clearly hasn’t forgotten. Preseason or not, Green showed once again he doesn’t need the regular season to bring his usual regular-season energy.

During one sequence midway through the second quarter, Mazzulla called for three subs in less than 20 seconds as his team gave up three consecutive offensive rebounds before a 24-second violation mercifully ended the possession. Anfernee Simons got caught out of position and Mazzulla pointed to Derrick White to replace him. Neemias Queta couldn’t corral the next misfire and Mazzulla called for Josh Minott to sub in. When rookie Hugo Gonzalez failed to secure the next rebound opportunity, Sam Hauser joined the growing cluster at the scorer’s table. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! It felt like a bit the scene in Christmas Vacation where Clark Griswold brings a gift to his boss , Frank Shirley. An annoyed Shirley doesn’t have time for small talk and picks up his office phone and tells his secretary, “Get me somebody. Anybody. And get me someone while I’m waiting!” Boston’s defensive rebound rate this preseason is 64.3 percent. That’s 7.4 percent below the team's 71.7 defensive rebound rate last season, which ranked seventh in the NBA. The Celtics' current 64.3 percent mark would have been 3.5 percent worse than last-place Philadelphia for the entirety of the 2024-25 season. Mazzulla has had a short leash on his players all preseason for their miscues, particularly on the glass, and it was on full display on Sunday night. The Cavaliers attempted a staggering 102 field goal attempts, making just 36. That’s 66 misfires, with Boston securing just 39 offensive rebounds. (The Cavs had 21 offensive rebounds.) Boston’s defensive rebound rate of 59.7 percent on Sunday was its worst of the preseason. The first two games were nothing to write home about, either (68.5 percent vs. Toronto; 66.1 percent vs. Memphis) Mazzulla, already seemingly riled up after answering a postgame query about 3-pointers, bristled at multiple postgame questions surrounding the team’s rebounding woes. He repeatedly noted the team simply needed to, “Find five guys that will rebound.” The Celtics produced a 31-point preseason victory on Sunday night, and you would have through they lost by 31 based on Mazzulla’s postgame tone. But this team has always emphasized process over results. After the offseason departures of Kristaps Porzingis, Luke Kornet, and Al Horford, rebounding was bound to be in the spotlight to start the new campaign. The Celtics have received positive output from some of their new faces, including the trio of Chris Boucher, Luka Garza, and Josh Minott. But how the big-man rotation will shake out remains unclear just nine days before the start of the season. Neemias Queta had an excellent summer playing for Portugal at EuroBasket but has had two rough showings to start the preseason. Newcomers Boucher and Garza have been sharper, but no combination of players has quite solved Boston’s rebounding issues. Mazzulla has experimented this preseason starting double-big lineups with Boucher at one of the big man spots, then went single big with Boucher on Sunday night. It was 6-foot-4 Derrick White who led the Celtics with seven rebounds against the Cavaliers. Mazzulla has set a tone of accountability with his quick hooks in these games. The Celtics seem hell-bent on making up for some of Boston's talent drain by playing harder and smarter. Mazzulla, with his penchant for the margins, will not allow his team to beat itself by not putting in the effort necessary to finish defensive possessions. Maybe that will force the team to play bigger to start the season, potentially pairing Boucher with another big up front. Minott and Garza have been two of the team’s better rebounders at various times this preseason and can help the team shore up that area. But the bottom line is that, when you lose two experienced 7-footers and one of the smartest 6-foot-9 guys in the league, then you just need to work harder on the glass. We suspect Monday’s film session will focus a lot more on what went wrong than what went well. That’s too bad because the Celtics’ offense has been humming, Simons has shown he can get hot in a hurry, and Boston has plenty of reasons to be optimistic about its ability to remain competitive during the 2025-26 season. But Mazzulla knows that the margin for error is slimmer while waiting for Jayson Tatum to get back to full health, and that the Celtics can’t gift their opponent extra possessions. On Sunday night, Mazzulla made his point. The Celtics have to show they listened with their effort on the glass moving forward."}

With Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler III out Sunday night, Kerr handed the offense to the youngsters. To Podziemski, with Jonathan Kuminga as his primary tag-team partner. It was an audition of sorts, to see how the offense would perform without the usual producers. While Kuminga’s performance in a 126-116 preseason loss to the Lakers in Los Angeles was equal parts grand and ghastly, Podziemski aced the test. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “He was great,” Kerr told reporters at Crypto.com Arena. “He's been really aggressive throughout camp. I know he didn't score particularly well in the first two games, but this is more like what he's looked like in practice and scrimmages. Super aggressive, very confident with his shot, moving the ball ... “He just has a good feel and a good flow, a good pace to his game. He was definitely aggressive and playing at a high level. I think he knew without Steph and Jimmy, he needed to be more aggressive.” Starting at point guard in place of Curry, Podziemski delivered a team highs points (23) on 10-of-16 shooting from the field, including 3 of 7 from distance and assists (eight), while tying for second in rebounds (five). Of the 13 Warriors who played at least eight minutes, Podziemski was one of two to post positive plus/minus numbers. Playing a team-high 26 minutes, he committed two turnovers yet finished with a team-best plus-6, with Gary Payton II submitting a plus-5. Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Podziemski was the catalyst in the Warriors’ terrific third quarter, when, they outscored LA 39-27, trimming the 17-point halftime deficit (63-46) to five (90-85). He scored 14 points in 10 minutes, with 6-of-8 shooting from the floor, including 2 of 4 from beyond the arc. He added three assists and one steal. It was the purpose with which Podziemski moved that stood out. He has reduced his wasted motion and maintained focus on the task of coordinating the squad. Only one of his 16 field-goal attempts was a blatantly forced. “Just have (to have) an understanding of who's out, who I’ve got on the floor with me, what I’ve got to do as a point guard to make sure everybody gets their touches – but also play within myself,” Podziemski said. “I think I did a good job of evenly distributing the load throughout the guys I was out there with.” Podziemski’s development is crucial to Golden State achieving its goal of making a strong start to the season. Though De’Anthony Melton is projected as the eventual starter in the backcourt alongside Curry, he’s still post-surgery rehab and could miss the first month , if not more. Moses Moody, another candidate, did not play Sunday and will sit the final two preseason games while nursing soreness in his left calf. The job, then, will fall into the hands of Podziemski, a lesser defender than the either Melton or Moody, but perhaps possessing a more comprehensive set of skills of offense. “I can't say that yet,” Kerr said when asked about the possibility of Podziemski as a starter. “We've got to see where we are. Brandon's going to play a ton. He’s a hugely important player for us. But the starting lineup, frankly, is a little tricky for us, given the pieces and (Al Horford’s) age. Horford remains a likely starter, but only Draymond Green, Butler and Curry are locked into the lineup. Kerr and his staff still are studying the best ways to manage the minutes of the 39-year-old center. “If Al were a little younger, he’d be in the starting lineup for sure,” Kerr said. “But if he's playing limited minutes, it's tougher to start him and finish the game. If he's not playing as many minutes as he would have a few years ago. So, we still have a lot to think about. But Brandon is going to be a huge part of it one way or the other.” With Kuminga joining Podziemski in the starting lineup against the Lakers, the offense spent the first half looking like a unit that introduced to each other on Sunday morning. The most spectacular highlight was a left-handed transition dunk by Kuminga, but he committed turnovers in 15 first-half minutes, as the Warriors gifted LA 12 points off 14 Golden State turnovers before halftime. “We had too many turnovers; he had a couple of them,” Kerr said. “We'll have to look at the tape, but it felt like our spacing wasn't great on some of those turnovers. But 14 as a team in the first half, you can't recover from that. We've got to clean that up. “But that was the whole team.” In addition to Kuminga’s five first-half turnovers, Green committed three and Buddy Hield was charged with two. Podziemski? He had one in the half, two in the game. If that becomes the norm, he’ll be hard to keep out of the team’s first seven. On a roster with such advanced age at the top, there must be a place for productive, youthful energy. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

Expert analysis on overvalued players like LeBron James and Josh Hart to protect your fantasy roster this season.", "body": "Manage your account ... Drafting the right players can make or break your fantasy basketball season, but knowing who to avoid is equally crucial. As we head into the 2025-26 NBA season, several big-name players carry significant bust potential despite their attractive ADPs. From injury concerns to reduced roles, these five NBA stars could derail your fantasy roster if you're not careful. News broke Thursday that James (sciatica) is going to miss the start of the regular season. It will mark the first time in his career that he will not be ready for a season opener. Injuries weren't a major issue for him last season, with him playing 70 games and averaging 35 minutes. He turned that hefty workload into averages of 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 8.2 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.1 three-pointers per game. It's not a decline in production that makes James someone to consider fading. He will turn 41 years old in December and is coming off back-to-back seasons in which he appeared in at least 70 games. The Lakers have needed him to play a ton based on their past roster construction, but they don't have the same issues this year. Luka Doncic can carry the load whenever James is out, and the Lakers have a good overall supporting cast that includes Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton. They also improved their depth with the additions of Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia. James' main goal is to be healthy for what he hopes will be a deep playoff run. Given his age, expect him to be very cautious with any injuries that come up. Even when he's healthy, he could see added rest days, especially down the stretch. He's too risky to be a second or third round pick in fantasy. Hart was a breakout star for those who drafted him last season. He provided excellent all-around production, averaging 13.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.1 three-pointers. He also shot 52.5% from the field, which was up from 43.4% the season prior. Many fantasy managers were able to select him outside the top 100 in their leagues, making him one of the best values of the season. Things could be very different for Hart this season. Tom Thibodeau was a very fantasy-friendly coach, often riding his starters heavy minutes. Hart was no exception, as he averaged 38 minutes while playing 77 games. Thibodeau is gone and has been replaced by Mike Brown. The Knicks have also improved their bench, bringing in Jordan Clarkson, Guerschon Yabusele and Malcolm Brogdon. Hart could even lose his starting job to Mitchell Robinson, who missed most of last season while battling injury. In what could end up being a drastic decline in playing time, Hart is difficult to justify selecting this early in drafts. The Nuggets needed to make some moves to improve their cap situation and add depth. Their lack of talent on the bench was a big problem last season and contributed to them being ousted from the playoffs. In order to make bench additions, the Nuggets traded Porter to the Nets in a deal that landed them Cameron Johnson. Denver then used their cap flexibility to add Bruce Brown, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jonas Valanciunas. Porter goes from being the number three or four option on the Nuggets to being a leading man with Cam Thomas on the Nets. An increased usage rate should help his scoring upside. However, Porter now finds himself on a rebuilding team that is filled with rookies. The Nets aren't likely to make a run for a playoff spot, so we could see Porter rested down the stretch. Even if Porter gets off to a hot start with his new squad, he might not be able to maintain it. After struggling in his first campaign with the Wizards, Poole bounced back to average 20.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.3 steals and 3.5 three-pointers last season. On the downside, he shot just 43.2% from the field and averaged 3.0 turnovers. He changed teams yet again this offseason, being moved to the Pelicans in a trade that sent C.J. McCollum to the Wizards. Poole now finds himself part of a much more talented roster that includes Zion Williamson and Trey Murphy III. That might make it difficult to maintain his 29.0% usage rate from last year. Dejounte Murray (Achilles) could also return around January, which could throw a wrinkle into Poole's playing time. Don't be surprised if Poole's scoring numbers take a significant hit this season. It couldn't have gone much worse for George during his first season with the 76ers. Injuries limited him to just 41 games. When he was on the floor, he wasn't very effective. He averaged only 16.2 points, breaking his streak of nine straight seasons in which he averaged at least 21.5 points. He also shot just 43.0% from the field. On the bright side, he did chip in 5.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.8 steals and 2.3 three-pointers per game. While George is generally being drafted outside the top 75 this season, he's still someone to consider fading. His injury concerns are nothing new, as he has played more than 56 games in a season just one time since he left the Thunder following the 2018-19 campaign. He is currently dealing with a knee injury that could impact him at the start of the season. It's difficult to have much faith in the 35-year-old remaining healthy."}

The question caused Lakers coach JJ Redick to say he was “not being combative\" with his answer. Asked if the Lakers are missing opportunities to practice more and build on-court chemistry because of their busy six-game preseason slate, Redick was quick to wonder why reporters were so concerned about the situation. “You guys are really harping on this,” Redick responded. So, Redick was asked, is it a thing or is it not a thing? “I’m not being combative right now,” Redick said. “I just want to acknowledge that you guys, like the last four days, like it’s becoming a little bit obsessive with all these questions about opportunities lost. So, I will answer it again. These are the cards that we were dealt. I sure would like everybody to be healthy.” Making the most out of the situation, the Lakers held off the Golden State Warriors 126-116 Sunday night at Crypto.com Arena despite not playing with LeBron James (sciatica), Luka Doncic and Marcus Smart (Achilles tendinopathy). Redick said the plan is for Smart to “get two games [in] this week.” Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue The Lakers have three remaining preseason games: Tuesday at Phoenix, Wednesday at Las Vegas against the Dallas Mavericks and Friday against the visiting Sacramento Kings — four games over a six-day span. Redick was reminded that the Lakers as an organization have chosen to play six preseason games — the maximum allowed by the NBA. “It’s something to be discussed I think going forward,” Redick said. “I think it’s awesome. I really do because we got to play in Palm Springs and I think it’s awesome that we get to play in Vegas and I recognize that there’s Lakers fans all over the world that maybe don’t get the chance to see us play. \"You hope that we can find some sort of balance in the future to get more practice time, less travel time. I’m sure at some point we’ll be one of the teams going overseas, so then that adds another scenario.\" Redick did say for training camp purposes, practice tends to be more helpful in team building than preseason games. “I think more practices would be beneficial,\" Redick said. “I do think the exposure to a game situation and playing against an opponent is very beneficial. You don’t have a lot of days anymore and to try to cram six games in there [and] four games in six nights, it’s significantly difficult.” Against the Warriors on Sunday, Austin Reaves (21 points), Dalton Knecht (16), Rui Hachimura (16) and Deandre Ayton (14 points, eight rebounds, five assists) were on top of their games. For Ayton, who was six for eight from the field and had a blocked shot, his joy came from the fans cheering him on. Sure, it was only a preseason game, but Ayton loved the vibe and the positive energy he felt. It was Ayton’s first time playing at Crypto.com Arena since he signed a two-year, $16.6-million deal with the Lakers. “It hit me in the whole arena today just hearing the fans and everybody cheering,” Ayton said. “It was kind of an unusual sound other than boos. ... It was everybody showing love and welcoming me to L.A. I played so freely and I had a lot of fun.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

The Sacramento Kings will be without forward Keegan Murray to start the season. Murray suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb during the team’s preseason loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night, the team announced on Sunday afternoon. Murray is set to undergo surgery in the near future, and he’ll be evaluated again in four-to-six weeks. [ Get more Kings news: Sacramento team feed ] If Murray is out the full six weeks, he could be eligible to return for the Kings' matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 24, the team’s 18th game of the season. Murray averaged 12.4 points and 6.7 rebounds last season, his third in the league after the Kings took him with the No. 4 overall pick in 2022. He’s missed just 13 games throughout his career due to injury. The former Iowa standout is entering the final year of his initial four-year, $36.3 million deal with the franchise, and he’s eligible for an extension this month. If Murray and the Kings can’t get a deal done, he’ll enter restricted free agency next summer. The 25-year-old has been a reliable piece in the Kings’ starting lineup over the past three seasons, and he’ll presumably play a big role in the team’s effort to make it back to the postseason — something they’ve only done once in the past two decades. The Kings went 40-42 last season and ended up firing head coach Mike Brown. The team eventually promoted interim head coach Doug Christie to replace him permanently. The Kings will open the regular season on Oct. 22 against the Phoenix Suns. It’s unclear who will take Murray’s place in the starting lineup in the meantime, though Christie experimented with rookie Maxime Raynaud at the position on Sunday, according to the Sacramento Bee . The Kings took Raynaud with the No. 42 overall pick in the draft earlier this summer out of Stanford, where he averaged 20.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. “In our league, two bigs, we’re starting to see quite a bit, so it’s one of the things I think that you’ve got to look at,” Christie said. “Max is a talented player. This is the preseason, so to get him out there and to get him those types of reps is more what that’s about. We’ve got a couple other options over the next couple days that we’ll throw out there.”"}

The streak came to an end in their 126-116 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers at Crypto.com Arena. The Warriors were without multiple key contributors , including Steph Curry, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford and Moses Moody. Seth Curry missed his third straight preseason game after being a late signing to training camp, and De’Anthony Melton (knee) and Alex Toohey (ankle) continue to be out from injuries. Vying for a starting position in the backcourt, Brandin Podziemski took advantage of being a focal point of the Warriors’ offense. Podziemski had nine points through the first half and then caught fire in the third, scoring 14. The Warriors then only trailed by five points going into the fourth quarter because of Podziemski's efforts.

Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Down their top two players, adding Horford and Moody to the list of Warriors absences called for an interesting starting five. Coach Steve Kerr started with Podziemski, Buddy Hield, Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green and Quinten Post. Moody is out the rest of the preseason and will be re-evaluated in a week with what the Warriors are calling a strained calf. “We’re not too concerned about it. It’s just we’re being careful,” Kerr told reporters in LA. The age of the Warriors’ top players already guarantees Kerr will have to be comfortable with multiple combinations and consistently tinker with who his starters are. This was the perfect opportunity for several young Warriors and role players to step up. The score was tied 13-13 when Kerr made his first substitution, bringing Gary Payton II in for Post. Golden State’s starting five began the second half together, and came out strong trying to cut down a 17-point deficit. The Lakers’ lead was cut to 10 points with the Warriors outscoring the Lakers 21-14 through the first five and a half minutes of the third quarter when Kerr brought Payton in for Post. Offense will have to run through Kuminga on nights that Curry and Butler are out. There were moments where he showed he can step up with more responsibility, and others where consistency continues to be a problem. Kuminga in the first quarter twice took advantage of Dalton Knecht switching onto him in the post. He also had three assists in the first quarter. Then in the second, Kuminga went from getting his ankles crossed on defense to throwing down an explosive dunk that only he can slam left-handed with ease and authority. No. 1, Jonathan Kuminga pic.twitter.com/IiIsaLsEB2 JK what was that??? 📺 NBA League Pass pic.twitter.com/7chWeOeMI6 Kuminga in the first half scored nine points on 4-of-6 shooting and had four assists. His fourth was a dime to Pat Spencer cutting into the paint for a layup. But Kuminga also didn’t have one rebound at halftime, led the Warriors with five turnovers and was a game-low minus-18. There were highs and lows in Kuminga’s third game of the preseason. Kuminga played 22 minutes and scored an efficient 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting. He dominated around the rim, but missed his only 2-point shot outside the paint and badly forced one of his three 3-point attempts. Jonathan Kuminga dominated around the rim Kind of an up-and-down game, but the process has been positive pic.twitter.com/LpHp35Fgu3 The process overall has been positive. Kuminga is keeping his eyes up and mostly has been in flow of the offense. He finished with no rebounds, six assists and five turnovers as a minus-10. Between offseason additions and the development of certain players, Kerr has raved over the space these Warriors can create. He now can have an offense that plays four-out, or even five-out. When at full strength, that is. The end of the first quarter saw a unit of Pat Spencer, Will Richard, Payton, Gui Santos and Trayce Jackson-Davis struggle to score with very little spacing. None of those five are considered threats to shoot from long distance. The start of the second quarter also was a struggle. That group featured Podziemski, Hield, Kuminga, Santos and Jackson-Davis. Those five give Kerr one surefire 3-point threat in Hield, and a hopeful second with Podziemski. The Warriors as a team in the first half shot 19 percent from three, going 4 of 21. Payton was the only bench player to make a three, and no Warrior made multiple threes. They also didn’t attempt a single free throw in the first half, while the Lakers went 13 of 15 at the line. After making only four 3-pointers in the first half, the Warriors made three in the first two and a half minutes of the third quarter – two by Post and one from Podziemski – and five for the entire quarter. The Warriors made two more threes than the Lakers, 14 to 12, but shot a lowly 32.6 percent, which was far lower than LA’s 44.4 percent clip. Podziemski, Post and LJ Cryer were the only Warriors to make more than one three. Richard (1 of 6), Santos (1 of 5) and Spencer (1 of 5) combined to go 3 of 17 on threes.

Embiid featured Sunday in the Sixers’ annual Blue-White scrimmage at Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington, Delaware. And he shared the floor with another big man in Adem Bona. Nurse confirmed after the scrimmage that he’s “trying to look at Bona and Joel together.” With Paul George sidelined as he works back from a left knee injury and Trendon Watford out because of right hamstring tightness, it’s not yet clear how the Sixers will divvy up power forward minutes. Two-way contract player Dominick Barlow has played well this preseason and fellow two-way Jabari Walker has also been in the mix. Bona is an unconventional option, although Nurse noted his role may not change much alongside Embiid. The 22-year-old stuck almost exclusively to dunks, layups, put-backs and the occasional post-up his rookie year. In contrast, Embiid’s jump shooting and overall array of offensive skills have historically been giant strengths. “I think there’s kind of an open position at the four, especially right now with Paul not being quite ready yet,” Nurse said. “There’s a number of guys that we’re trying to work into that spot. … (Bona) is probably going to be more of the five. He’s going to play down toward the basket, rim protect and things like that. There’s certainly some drives and dump-offs to him … that are high-percentage plays. I like that part. He’ll help the rebounding, he’ll help the rim protection. We’ll see how it goes.”’ Bona brought his typical shot swatting to the scrimmage and stared down Johni Broome after denying the rookie a dunk. He’s pleased at the prospect of playing next to Embiid. “I think it brings another dynamic to the team,” Bona said. “It’s going to bring a huge amount of size and presence in the paint.” While Bona measured a tad over 6-foot-8 without shoes at the NBA draft combine , he indeed plays much bigger. The UCLA product’s wingspan is a shade under 7-4. He posted a 40-inch maximum vertical leap at the combine and sure seems to have added to that. Of course, most Sixers projections ride on Embiid’s health. He scrimmaged Sunday, moved smoothly and scored plenty. Joel Embiid with the slam at Sixers’ Blue-White scrimmage: pic.twitter.com/ocr2k27ZJd The Sixers have avoided timelines in discussing Embiid’s return from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. The scrimmage was his first live action in front of a crowd since Feb. 22. “I knew this would be the first time you guys had seen him for a long time,” Nurse said. “I don’t know how many weeks this is now — I’m losing track — but he’s been out there playing. Again, just trying to continue to progress. “Today was a good progression day. Lots of running, lots of 5-on-5, lots of early practice stuff, lots of 5-on-0. … And then he went out there and did his thing. He shot the ball well, he scored well, he orchestrated the offense well. I thought he ran pretty good as well — both directions.” Bona would love to see all of that translate to games. When the Sixers drafted him, he envisioned frontcourt minutes with Embiid. “I’ve been working toward that,” he said, “and I’m really excited to see how that’s going to look.”"}

Dybantsa (BYU) and Cameron Boozer (Duke) all in the mix for the No. 1 pick, with some other real talent such as Nate Ament (Tennessee), Mikel Brown (Louisville) and Tounde Yessoufou (Baylor) worth keeping an eye on. Brooklyn isn’t the only team starting this season with an eye toward the draft, the same idea is playing out in Utah and Washington, and you can be sure a few other teams with long-shot postseason hopes will be pivoting to the strategy early. The Nets control their own pick this season, but in 2027 the Houston Rockets have swap rights. Starting in 2028, the Nets will have their own first-round picks and/or first-round picks or swaps coming in from the Knicks, 76ers and Nuggets. A Division of NBCUniversal .

He chose not to pick up his $3.5 million player option in Denver (not a shock after he had a locker room clash with Aaron Gordon during the playoffs), but no team has stepped up yet with a deal to replace it. Despite rumored offers for him in China, Westbrook is staying put stateside, and his most likely landing spot remains the team he flirted with all summer, the Sacramento Kings. Here is what ESPN’s Shams Charania reported on NBA Today . “I’m told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings. And the Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that, and he’s got relationships across that organization. Domantas Sabonis, he’s close with, played with him. He played with Dennis Schroeder as well, DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine. They have L.A. ties as well. BJ Armstrong, the new assistant general manager there. He knows BJ Armstrong from the agency side, and he does have respect with Scott Perry, their new general manager, and Doug Christie, their new head coach. We’ll see if a deal gets done before the start of the season or during this upcoming year.” Charania is not the only one reporting this, well-connected Sacramento radio guy Carmichael Dave called it “70/30 Russell Westbrook joins the Kings this year.” If the sides can figure out the money. Sacramento does have an open roster spot and is about $5.4 million below the luxury tax line. Dennis Schroder will start at the point, but unless second-year player Devin Carter is ready to make a big leap up to backup point guard, that role falls more to Malik Monk, who is better as an off-ball two guard (but can play some point). It’s easy to see where he slots into the roster, the question is money. Westbrook, 37, averaged 13.3 points and 6.1 assists a game last season for the Nuggets, and he remains one of the highest energy players in the game. However, he’s not a consistent or efficient scorer at this point in his career, nor is he a great defender. He could fill a bench role, as he has done the past couple of seasons, but don’t be shocked if we get into the season before a team makes that offer. Sacramento is also a roster that could look very different at the end of the season. This is a team open to trading DeRozan, LaVine or Sabonis if the deal is right. Where Westbrook would slot into all that is a question for coach Doug Christie. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Doncic hasn’t been injured during preseason, the Lakers have just been cautious not to overexert him after the 26-year-old spent part of the summer playing for the Slovenian national team at EuroBasket 2025. Redick indicated that Doncic will be on a minutes restriction vs. the Suns. Forward Jarred Vanderbilt said Doncic has looked good in recent practices, according to Price. “ Heâs moving great ,” Vanderbilt said Monday. “ Everything that Iâve seen from him, like, heâs being vocal.

He will be reevaluated in four-to-six weeks. October 12: Kings forward Keegan Murray has been diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb, the team announced today in a press release. It’s unfortunate timing for Murray, who is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension between now and October 20. While his injury likely won’t impact the Kings’ long-term view of him or significantly impact those negotiations, the 25-year-old won’t have the opportunity to make a final case for a new deal on the court this week in the team’s two remaining preseason games. The fourth overall pick in the 2022 draft, Murray had a promising rookie season in which he averaged 12.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, shot 41.1% from beyond the three-point line, and finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting as he started 78 games for Sacramento. The 6’8″ forward has remained a starter for the Kings in the two years since then and has improved as a defender, but hasn’t taken a step forward offensively. In 2024/25, he averaged 12.4 PPG on .444/.343/.833 shooting while playing a career-high 34.3 minutes per night. If Murray, who is earning roughly $11.1MM this season, doesn’t sign a rookie scale extension by next Monday, he’ll be on track for free agency during the summer of 2026. The Kings would have to tender him a qualifying offer worth approximately $14.7MM to make him a restricted free agent at that time. It’s unclear who will take Murray’s spot in the starting five while he recovers, but forward Nique Clifford started the second half in his place on Friday alongside Dennis SchrÃ¶der , Zach LaVine , DeMar DeRozan , and Domantas Sabonis . Dario Saric and Doug McDermott are among the team’s other options at forward — if head coach Doug Christie wants to roll with a guard-heavy lineup, he could make Malik Monk or Keon Ellis a starter. Poor Kings fans. My sincere best wishes for a full recovery. This isnt his fault, but I feel like Murray has been very disappointing after his rookie season He’s gotten much better defensively and with rebounding, but his offense has taken a hit. Offense took a dip because the worst run franchise in the NBA wanted to be the Sacramento Bulls and run the same team the bulls had. Levine is a 3rd Star making 1star money. DeMar DeRozan is cooked and should be a bench scorer. And sabonis is a PF playing center. He was already an older rookie so the development was limited. He seems pretty one dimensional and lacks the attacking to rim moves. Defense is okay. Although this is a bit of a hit for the kings, it’s early in the season so it allows Christie to give other guys more time. Let’s see if Saric can slide into a starting role and be consistent. Also it’s a great opportunity for Christie to experiment with mall ball lineups with Monk playing with the starters. I think they would use Ellis over Monk in a small ball starting lineup. You can’t have Monk, Demar, and Lavine all at once due to no defense and they all want shots. He’s gotta be faking it, according to you. How so? Or is this just another one of your delusions? That his point apparently went over your head is unsurprising. Except it didn’t, the problem is the point is purely based on a delusion created in his head. Which makes this point of yours also a delusion. Quite the common theme from warriors fans I’ve noticed We all saw you claim that Moody didn’t injure his UCL in March. Troll on! Yea and what’s your point troll? “Letâs see if Saric can slide into a starting role and be consistent. ” LMAO ! It’s a pretty good question considering he hasn’t had a consistent starting role in 5 years. Try again, lMaO This guy is a SF not a PF at all. Should never play PF Well that suxx .

Whitehead being cut is significant because his $3,262,560 salary for 2025/26 is fully guaranteed, meaning the Nets will now carry a dead-money cap hit. Assuming he clears waivers, Whitehead’s $5,366,912 team option for 2026/27 will be declined as part of the transaction. A 6’7″ wing, Whitehead was a highly touted high school recruit who has dealt with several injuries over the past few years. Brooklyn selected Whitehead No. 22 overall in the 2023 draft after he spent one season at Duke, but the 21-year-old has only played in 22 NBA games over the past two seasons, averaging 5.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in 12.3 minutes per contest. As ESPN’s Bobby Marks tweets , waiving Whitehead puts the Nets $16K above the NBA’s minimum salary floor . Brooklyn needed to move above that salary cap threshold by next Tuesday, Marks adds. Timme, who had a decorated college career at Gonzaga, went undrafted in 2023 and spent most of the past two seasons in the G League. He was promoted to a two-year standard contract in late March after a strong ’24/25 regular season with the Nets’ affiliate team in Long Island. The Nets picked up their $1,955,377 on Timme in late June, but his salary was fully non-guaranteed, so they won’t incur a cap hit by waiving him. The 25-year-old forward/center averaged 12.1 PPG, 7.2 RPG and 2.2 APG in nine games (28.2 MPG) with Brooklyn down the stretch last season. His shooting line was .441/.257/.625. Since he only has one year of NBA experience, Timme could theoretically return to the Nets on a two-way deal if he goes unclaimed, notes Brian Lewis of The New York Post ( Twitter links ). However, the team has yet to determine if Timme will get that final two-way spot, Lewis reports. Waiving Whitehead and Timme likely means the Nets are deciding between Jalen Wilson and Tyrese Martin for their 15th standard roster spot. Wilson has a $88K partial guarantee which will increase to about $382K if he makes the regular season roster, while Martin’s contract is fully non-guaranteed. Tyrese Martin has been the backup SG for Brooklyn (but on a Non-Guarantee, he should make the team with this news). They are doing Whitehead a favor by waiving him ahead of the cutdown date, in that he might be able to latch on / get a Two-Way somewhere. Timme was heading down this path once the Nets drafted Danny Wolf (and acquired Highsmith & Bufkin as salary dumps). They would likely look to keep him on a Two-Way if he clears Waivers. NETS DEPTH CHART PG: Nolan Traore, Ben Saraf, Kobe Bufkin, Tyson Etienne (TW) SG: Cam Thomas, Tyrese Martin, Drake Powell (INJ) SF: Terance Mann, Ziaire Williams, Egor Demin (INJ) PF: Michael Porter Jr, Noah Clowney, Naywood Highsmith (INJ), E.J. Liddell (TW) C: Nicholas Claxton, Day’Ron Sharpe, Danny Wolf Zeng Fanbo is currently vying for the open Two-Way spot. I can see the Nets parting ways with the 26-year old Etienne in favor of Timme. Oh geez, I completely forgot Jalen Wilson. Wilson is also non-guaranteed, so there’s still a roster competition going on. It does feel like the Nets would keep both players, but his path to minutes isn’t as clear as Martin’s is. Wilson lead the team in minutes last year, but Mann is likely to absorb most of those. The next odd-man out could be either Kobe Bufkin (4.5M), or Haywood Highsmith 5.6M). (Also I made a cute Haywood typo in the OP) the last spot will come down to Martin or Wilson. This one is hard to handicap. I would think the edge would go to Wilson mostly bc I think Martin would take playing time away from guys like Bufkin, Saraf and Powell, all of whom they need to evaluate. And they drafted Wilson. But Martin has supposedly been playing well. I could see someone trading for Martin. Man, what a roster… Must be the worst since the sixers during the process years Even in the East, winning 10 games could be tough for them. Theyâll be more competitive than you think. Timme hopefully to the Blazers and they can trade or waive either Rupert or Murray. Preferably trade either one of them to somebody for a second round pick. Portland does have a Two-Way open, and Timme would be an attractive fit there. Their Centers are Donovan Clingan, rookie Yang Hansen, and Duop Reath. (With apologies to walking trade exception Robert Williams) Timme definitely deserves a roster spot somewhere after what he showed with the Nets last year Definitely a Heat type of pickup. Roster on a bad team. He wouldn’t get minutes on actual contenders, he will be hunted on the defensive side pnr switched. Timme will get on a team though just not a good one. Maybe Dariq would be good for the Kings. They need bigger wings. The Nets have no players who have played more than 6 seasons. Never seen that before, they better grab Russ or something or else this season is going to be totally lost at sea. MPJ is maybe the dumbest man in the NBA, off-court IQ is sub-100 (his on-court IQ is significantly higher though). HE is the “veteran presence”? Yikes. not even remotely close to the truth. Explain. wrt to MPJ, that is. regarding the teamâs projection, itâs a developmental year, so theyâre not interested in adding another veteran. I mean I get it, but it just seems extreme to not have at least one guy with a decade in the game. Not MPJ, Claxton and Mann being the oldest guys on the team. Mann and Highsmith are the oldest players on the team. Whitehead is worth looking into. I do wonder why Nets are cutting him.

Milwaukee currently has 19 players under contract, two shy of the offseason limit, though that number will go up to 20 as soon as Antetokounmpo has been signed. Alex looked pretty good in the FIBA Euro games… perhaps he still has a chance in the NBA. Also, Ryan went undrafted in 2024* Nevermind, I was watching Kostas… Does Giannis have any other brothers? I should hope he went undrafted in 2004, he was only 5 years old haha Yeah, typo. Didn’t see this until now because I was filling in the Nets story. It’s been fixed, thanks. Undrafted in 2004 and still getting looks 21 years later. Impressive. Please login to leave a reply. Log in Register Username or Email Address Password Remember Me Register"}

Here are the most noteworthy storylines from 14 of the league's most intriguing teams.", "body": "The NBA's preseason is drawing to a close The curtain will rise on the 2025-26 season in Oklahoma City on Oct. 21, when the defending champion Thunder will celebrate their first championship as they host former Thunder star Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets . And while much of the preseason is about rounding into shape and getting to the start of the season healthy, there are still things that can be gleaned from the early October action. To take stock of where things sit after most of the exhibition slate has been played, our NBA reporters -- Tim Bontemps, Jamal Collier, Vince Goodwill, Baxter Holmes, Tim MacMahon, Dave McMenamin, Anthony Slater, Michael C. Wright and Ohm Youngmisuk -- provided their takeaways on several contenders from each conference, and what each franchise looks like heading into the upcoming season. Jump to a team: ATL | CLE | DAL DET | GSW | HOU LAC | LAL | MIL NYK | OKC | ORL PHI | SAS Charles Barkley weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Bucks after Milwaukee had trade conversations with the Knicks earlier in the offseason. One of the early observations made by players during the first days of Hawks camp was that everyone was on the court, and the trainer's room was empty. The Hawks are healthy and buzzing over new additions Kristaps Porzingis , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard . But being healthy again is vital to the Hawks' success and growth. A huge piece for Atlanta this season is Jalen Johnson , who looked good in his first two preseason games back from left shoulder surgery that ended his 2024-25 season -- Johnson made 7 of 11 shots and had 20 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in 25 minutes against Memphis. Coach Quin Snyder said Johnson's improvement on defense will be the next step for the young forward. If he can stay healthy and continue to grow as a playmaker to help Young and Porzingis, the Hawks could really take off this season. -- Youngmisuk The Cavaliers have a lot of depth, and they will need it. Max Strus is likely out for a few months with a Jones fracture in his left foot. Darius Garland will miss the opening weeks of the season as well after offseason turf toe surgery. New addition Lonzo Ball is not going to play back-to-backs, and played 35 games last season for the Chicago Bulls after missing the prior two seasons with injuries. De'Andre Hunter has never played more than 67 games and has missed at least 25 games in three of his six seasons. And Dean Wade has eclipsed 60 games in one of his six seasons. So, while Cleveland feels good about where it sits entering the season after claiming the top seed in the East last season, the Cavaliers are already navigating injuries -- and likely will be throughout this season. -- Bontemps Giving third-year forward Ausar Thompson more responsibility has come into focus. The team began to take off last season when his health restrictions (blood clot) were lifted and his two-way prowess was unleashed. Now, the Pistons view him as a secondary ball handler, initiating offense as a change-of-pace guard to contrast the more deliberate Cade Cunningham . Coach J.B. Bickerstaff noted how Thompson initiated some offense with Cunningham on the floor to present a different look. With Jaden Ivey (left fibula) still \"dealing with some discomfort\" according to Bickerstaff, the team is bringing him along slowly, thus creating more opportunity for Thompson on offense. As for Cunningham, preseason is the smallest of sample sizes, but according to those close, \"he's proving last year wasn't a fluke.\" -- Goodwill The 18-year-old rookie scored 10 points and contributed 6 rebounds, 3 assists and a blocked shot in 14 minutes. The Giannis saga is far from over. Despite the attempts from the Bucks to quell speculation over Antetokounmpo 's future since the start of camp, the two-time MVP has simultaneously emphasized his current commitment to the Bucks while leaving the door open that he could continue his career elsewhere . Antetokounmpo has doubled down on his desire to compete for championships with an unwillingness to accept anything less. It has put the pressure on the Bucks this season to prove he can win another championship in Milwaukee. For a team that has lost in the first round in three consecutive seasons, not advancing further in the playoffs could lead to a day of reckoning. -- Collier Off the floor, the Antetokounmpo situation will hang over the team and possibly the locker room all season following the revelation of a negotiating period between the Knicks and Bucks this offseason. Several key players will be on notice and have an eye on what's going on with Milwaukee to track Antetokounmpo's frame of mind. On the floor, the Knicks want to play faster on offense and shoot more 3s, but it has been a work in progress through four preseason games. The Knicks have a favorable schedule to start the season, which should provide an early window into how the Mike Brown era will look in New York. -- Goodwill The Magic are getting healthier and that is a big deal. Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner started camp healthy after both dealt with oblique injuries last season -- they missed a combined total of 58 regular-season games. Orlando isn't whole yet, though. Guard Jalen Suggs is still slowly making his way back from left knee surgery and Mo Wagner remains out with a torn left ACL sustained in late December 2024. In the meantime, Banchero, Wagner and the rest of the Magic will try to develop chemistry as quickly as possible with new addition Desmond Bane while hoping to drastically improve on a league-worst 31.8% 3-point shooting from last season. The Magic have started out camp playing faster, focusing on getting out in transition and using defense to create offense. Through the first three preseason games, the Magic averaged 104 possessions. They averaged a league-low 96.5 possessions per game last season. The most important thing will be going into the season with Banchero, Wagner and Bane healthy and hoping Suggs can add to the team once he is ready. -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid might be healthy? That feels strange to say after everything that has happened over the past 18 months with Embiid and the 76ers, but so far it has been a relatively stress-free preseason in Philadelphia. Embiid appears on track to be ready for the 76ers opener against their rivals, the Boston Celtics , on Oct. 22. Anyone who has followed Embiid's tenure in Philadelphia knows how quickly things can change, and he has had enough issues with his knee that it's fair to wonder how long it will last until another flare up. Embiid himself said at the start of training camp they're just taking things day-by-day. But unlike last year, when his preseason was a waiting game to see when his knee would be ready to go, Embiid has practiced regularly, participated in Sunday's open scrimmage and is expected to play Friday against Minnesota in Philadelphia's preseason finale. -- Bontemps Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The mantra of Dallas GM Nico Harrison is \" defense wins championships ,\" but the Mavericks have some things to figure out on that end of the floor, particularly on the perimeter. Coach Jason Kidd said he has to \"continue to look at different combinations to see what gives us the best way to start the game\" after the Hornets scored 95 points through three quarters as the Mavs played their starters into the second half. Klay Thompson was tasked with being the primary defender on Charlotte star LaMelo Ball , which is probably asking too much out of a 35-year-old with his injury history. The options are limited if D'Angelo Russell starts alongside Thompson. P.J. Washington typically took the toughest perimeter defensive assignment last season, but he came off the bench in the first two preseason games. Would the Mavs be better off starting Washington with 18-year-old Cooper Flagg as the primary offensive initiator? That's the look Kidd went with against the Utah Jazz on Monday when Russell rested. -- MacMahon The headliners aren't showing any alarming signs of age at the moment. Al Horford has fit the culture and system well so far. One of the leftover questions is how exactly Steve Kerr will deploy his starting lineup around Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . Horford will start at center on some nights, but Kerr said he wants to be careful considering Horford's age and the need to limit his minutes. \"If Al were a little younger, he'd be in the starting lineup for sure,\" Kerr said. He has hinted at a small-ball unit that includes Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski . But Moody hurt his left calf in practice and his status is uncertain to start the season. Podziemski punctuated a great camp with a 23-point night in Los Angeles against the Lakers. Kerr wouldn't officially commit to him as the starting shooting guard, but here is the presumed lineup for opening night: Curry, Podziemski, Butler, Green, Horford -- though it is anticipated, Kerr will change it around often. -- Slater Houston's offensive initiation by committee approach will work out just fine in the wake of veteran point guard Fred VanVleet 's season-ending injury. Rockets coach Ime Udoka often throws around the term \"KYP\" (know your personnel) in news conferences. Perhaps that intricate knowledge of Houston's roster played a major role in Udoka's confidence that his group \"can get the job done\" in VanVleet's absence. Early returns in the preseason have been promising with the Rockets utilizing multiple players -- mainly center Alperen Sengun and forward Amen Thompson -- to initiate offense. Expect Houston to also lean on Durant to facilitate the offense along with second-year guard Reed Sheppard , who appears to be growing more confident in his role. -- Wright Playing beneath the cloud of an NBA investigation -- and one centered around a team's star player -- is no small thing. But it appears the Clippers, for now, are resolved to not let that inquiry serve as a distraction. Through two preseason games, Kawhi Leonard appears in midseason form. He scored 18 points in 18 minutes in one game and 17 points in 19 minutes in the other. New acquisitions Brook Lopez and John Collins have seemed to fit in already and Chris Paul 's reunion with the Clippers feels seamless. The Clippers boast one of the league's oldest rosters, but it's also among the deepest, which should help some of their more veteran players as the season moves along. There are a few preseason games left, not that those offer concrete evidence of the season to come, but, despite the small sample size, the rebuilt Clippers appear especially promising. -- Holmes Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The extra time to practice and jell together that the team pined for after last season's abrupt first round exit was not to be. Unfortunately, training camp didn't provide the opportunity everyone hoped for. LeBron James was limited to being a vocal participant in the Lakers' scrimmages from the sidelines because of sciatica down his right side , which also kept him out of the preseason. Luka Doncic was purposely held out of the majority of L.A.'s preseason slate and was given a modified workload for a handful of practice days, with the medical staff cognizant of his EuroBasket duty over the summer . Marcus Smart , signed in the offseason, was out with Achilles tendinopathy. Maxi Kleber , who was only healthy and available for one game after being acquired from Dallas in the Doncic trade last February, missed most of camp with a quad injury. Rookie Adou Thiero was also limited because of knee swelling. \"These are the cards we were dealt,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"I surely would like everybody to be healthy.\" -- McMenamin All-NBA wing Jalen Williams is unlikely to be ready for the start of the regular season as he continues to recover from surgery on his right wrist, an operation he had on July 1 , after playing the entire postseason with torn ligaments. \"I would have cut my right hand off to win a championship,\" Williams told ESPN. He has only recently begun to shoot with his right hand again and has yet to be cleared for contact work. The Thunder and Williams have not publicly discussed a timetable for his return as they take a patient approach. \"Whenever I feel like I can be a hundred percent and do that whole thing, then I'll rock out,\" Williams said. -- MacMahon The Spurs will look different this season. Team president and former coach Gregg Popovich has always encouraged new coach Mitch Johnson to be himself. It'll be apparent on the floor this season as Johnson incorporates more of his own principles in San Antonio during his first full season on the job. Victor Wembanyama made that point clear in describing how the staff put together \"a more extended plan\" over the summer that emphasizes \"better recognition of our roles together.\" Veteran Harrison Barnes pointed out that \"We have a lot of new stuff that we're doing,\" adding that \"We've changed some of the processes of how we're doing [things]. That comes with Mitch implementing his style, which I think has been well-received by players.\" Expect the Spurs to flex their collective youth and athleticism to play a faster style. -- Wright"}

The purpose of simulating the NBA season ahead of time is generally to see how often various things are likely to happen, from the weakest teams winning the draft lottery to the best ones taking home the Larry O'Brien Trophy. It can also be fun to go through individual runs of the simulation to give an idea of what unlikely events could become reality based on random chance. In the spirit of ESPN's NFL tradition of detailing the events of a single simulation , let's go through the NBA season using simulation No. 620 -- chosen because of its interesting outcomes -- from opening night to the end of the NBA Finals. Note, this is not my prediction (or ESPN's) of how this season will unfold. The outcomes are produced at random via simulation, and everything else, including player stats, takes creative license. Along the way, we'll crown an NBA Cup winner, enjoy the action on Christmas Day, determine the final playoff seeds, set the draft lottery and winner, run through the play-in tournament, playoffs and finally, name the 2025-26 NBA champion. Let's get to it. Oklahoma City Thunder over Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors over Los Angeles Lakers After getting their championship rings and raising the first banner in the rafters at Paycom Arena, the Thunder showed why they were favored to repeat with an impressive win during Kevin Durant 's Houston debut. Durant scored 27 points against his former team, the first day of the regular season, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams both topped 20 points and Chet Holmgren had five blocks. Later, the Warriors spoiled Luka Doncic 's first home opener with the Lakers, handing them a 107-99 defeat. Afterward, an ebullient Draymond Green vowed that the Warriors, not Oklahoma City, should be considered the title favorites. Quarterfinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (4) Detroit Pistons (2) Miami Heat over (3) Cleveland Cavaliers (4) Minnesota Timberwolves over (1) Oklahoma City Thunder (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (2) Memphis Grizzlies Semifinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (2) Miami Heat (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (4) Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Cup final (Dec. 16): (1) Boston Celtics over (3) Portland Trail Blazers The NBA Cup, running from Oct. 21 to Dec. 16, resulted in an unexpected final in Las Vegas that pitted the Celtics against former guard Jrue Holiday and the Trail Blazers. Boston, off to a 16-10 start without the injured Jayson Tatum , finished as the No. 1 seed in the East play-in and beat the Pistons at home and the Heat in the semifinals in Las Vegas. The upstart Blazers, also 16-10, took advantage of the Thunder getting upset by the Timberwolves at home during the quarterfinals. Portland also won on the road, in Memphis, and then beat Minnesota in the semifinals. Alas, the Blazers' run ended in a 115-103 loss. Portland shot 10-of-36 on 3s, while Derrick White and Payton Pritchard made four apiece for Boston, which immediately shut down talk of referring to the NBA Cup as \"Banner 19.\" Still, the Celtics were able to match the rival Lakers' inaugural NBA Cup title. Struggling teams were the storyline on Christmas Day. The Cavaliers and Knicks , who entered the season as East favorites, were 11th and seventh, respectively, going into their matchup at Madison Square Garden. The Cavaliers, buried by early-season injuries to the backcourt, got some measure of satisfaction with a win over the Knicks. There was no such relief for the Lakers, who dropped five games below .500 after losing at home to Houston. The vibes were better for the top two teams in the West, the surprising Warriors and Thunder, who both won at home. So did the Denver Nuggets behind a 30-point triple-double from Nikola Jokic . As the NBA gathered from Feb. 13 to 15 at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, the Warriors were the talk of the league. Green and Jimmy Butler III joined Steph Curry on the West roster thanks to Golden State's league-best 42-13 record at the break. In the rearview mirror of the experienced Warriors there was plenty of youth with the Thunder 4.5 games back in the West and the ascendant Magic atop the East with the NBA's second-best record. After their slow starts, the Knicks and Cavaliers had righted the ships, moving up to second and fourth in the conference, respectively. The Clippers were tied for fourth in the West, but their crosstown rivals continued to stumble. Now 12 games below .500, the Lakers were all but eliminated from the play-in race at six games back of the Sacramento Kings for 10th. LeBron James mused about taking March off to watch his son Bryce play in the NCAA tournament for the Arizona Wildcats. With less than two weeks left in the regular season, plenty remained at stake, including the top seed in the West. The Thunder had closed within 2.5 games of the still-hot Warriors. The race to avoid the play-in was hard-fought with three teams at 40 wins apiece, albeit with the Blazers two games back in the loss column of Houston and Minnesota. Two games back in the loss column for the play-in, the Mavericks were still looking to make it with Kyrie Irving 's return to the lineup. In the East, the Celtics -- who had gone just 19-30 since winning the NBA Cup -- were trying to hold off the Philadelphia 76ers and disappointing Detroit Pistons to reach the play-in. The Warriors shut down any talk of a Thunder comeback by finishing the season on a 10-game winning streak to reach 63 wins, their most since 2016-17. In the East, the Magic ran away with the top seed and finished seven games clear of the Knicks. The No. 6 seed in both conferences was decided via a tiebreaker. Cleveland, which fell back off the pace after the All-Star break, ended up in the play-in with the Milwaukee Bucks getting the No. 6 seed. Meanwhile, Houston won a tie out West, sending the Timberwolves to the play-in a year after they narrowly avoided it. Defiant, Anthony Edwards vowed Minnesota would get back to the conference finals anyway. Eastern Conference No. 7 Cleveland Cavaliers over No. 8 Miami Heat (Cleveland clinches playoffs to face No. 2 Knicks) No. 9 Chicago Bulls over No. 10 Boston Celtics (Chicago advances; Boston eliminated) No. 9 Bulls over No. 8 Heat (Chicago clinches playoffs to face No. 1 Orlando; Miami eliminated) Western Conference No. 8 Portland Trail Blazers over No. 7 Minnesota Timberwolves (Portland clinches playoffs to face No. 2 Thunder) No. 10 Sacramento Kings over No. 9 Phoenix Suns (Sacramento advances; Phoenix eliminated) No. 10 Kings over No. 7 Timberwolves (Sacramento clinches playoffs to face No. 1 Warriors; Minnesota eliminated) Consider the Chicago Bulls the big winners of the play-in tournament, a place where they've got plenty of experience. Not only did Chicago win in Miami to claim the No. 8 seed in the East playoffs, but the Bulls also landed a first-round pick when Portland capped its unexpected season by winning at the Target Center to earn the seventh spot in the West. Things went from bad to worse for the Timberwolves in the final game of the play-in tournament as the Sacramento Kings handed them a surprise 103-101 loss on a DeMar DeRozan pull-up jumper in the final five seconds. Sacramento players celebrated by donning \"Kings of the Play-in\" T-shirts, much to the Bulls' dismay. There was less drama in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers salvaged the No. 7 seed with a 31-point win over Miami reminiscent of last year's dominant first-round sweep. 1. Utah Jazz (from Minnesota Timberwolves ) 2. Atlanta Hawks (from New Orleans Pelicans ) 3. Brooklyn Nets 4. Washington Wizards 5. Minnesota Timberwolves (from Utah Jazz ) 6. Charlotte Hornets 7. Detroit Pistons 8. Dallas Mavericks 9. Los Angeles Lakers 10. Oklahoma City Thunder (from Philadelphia 76ers ) 11. San Antonio Spurs 12. Boston Celtics 13. Memphis Grizzlies (from Phoenix Suns ) 14. Miami Heat For the second consecutive year, a team eliminated on the eve of the playoffs won the NBA draft lottery. This time, the Timberwolves didn't get to enjoy it like the Mavericks did in 2025. A swap from the Rudy Gobert trade sent the top pick to the Utah Jazz, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny their interest in drafting AJ Dybantsa from nearby BYU. The news wasn't all bad for Minnesota, which swapped down only to No. 5. Meanwhile, the 34-48 Pelicans didn't benefit from jumping up to No. 2, sending that pick to the Hawks to complete their deal on 2025 draft night. The Nets and Wizards claimed the next two picks, having entered with the best odds because of their combined 25 wins. Later on, the playoff-bound Thunder and Grizzlies acquired lottery picks through trades; the Grizzlies had the opportunity to swap for the Suns' pick in the Desmond Bane trade. Speaking to reporters before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged that the league's competition committee will revisit lottery odds to avoid teams preferring the lottery to advancing through the play-in tournament. Eastern Conference Round 1 (1) Orlando Magic over (8) Chicago Bulls , 4-1 (2) New York Knicks over (7) Cleveland Cavaliers , 4-2 (3) Atlanta Hawks over (6) Milwaukee Bucks , 4-1 (5) Toronto Raptors over (4) Indiana Pacers , 4-3 Western Conference Round 1 (1) Golden State Warriors over (8) Sacramento Kings , 4-1 (2) Oklahoma City Thunder over (7) Portland Trail Blazers , 4-0 (6) Houston Rockets over (3) Denver Nuggets , 4-3 (5) LA Clippers over (4) Memphis Grizzlies , 4-2 The most anticipated first-round series -- an expected matchup between the Knicks and Cavaliers in the conference finals -- ended up fizzling. Banged up from a difficult regular season and play-in appearance, Cleveland was eliminated at home in Game 6. But there was plenty of drama elsewhere. Two road teams with less experience won their Game 7s. The Toronto Raptors held former star Pascal Siakam to 15 points on 4-of-16 shooting for their first series win since 2020, and the Rockets shocked the Nuggets in Denver thanks to 12 fourth-quarter points from Durant. Houston hadn't advanced in the playoffs since 2019. The Clippers were the other lower seed to advance, beating Memphis, which ESPN BET listed as the underdog before the series. After winning Game 1 on the road, the Clippers closed out the Grizzlies at home in six games. Eastern Conference semifinals (1) Orlando Magic over (5) Toronto Raptors , 4-2 (2) New York Knicks over (3) Atlanta Hawks , 4-1 Western Conference semifinals (1) Golden State Warriors over (5) LA Clippers , 4-2 (2) Oklahoma City Thunder over (6) Houston Rockets , 4-3 The top two seeds in both conferences advanced in Round 2. For a second consecutive year, the Thunder needed seven games to reach the conference finals, but the Rockets pushed the defending champs without injured point guard Fred VanVleet . \"We'll be back,\" Durant said in a somber Houston locker room. The Warriors beat the Clippers in a battle of the NBA's two oldest rosters, and the Magic and Knicks reminded everyone that they've been the class of the East all season. Both dropped just three total games en route to a showdown in the conference semifinals. Conference finals (1) Orlando Magic over (2) New York Knicks , 4-1 (1) Golden State Warriors over (2) Oklahoma City Thunder , 4-2 The Magic cruised to their first trip to the NBA Finals since 2009, surprising New York at Madison Square Garden in Game 3 to take a 3-0 series lead before completing the gentleman's sweep. Meanwhile, in a battle of the NBA's last dynasty against a team aspiring to become one, the Warriors lived up to Green's seasonlong hype. The teams split the first two games of the series before Golden State won the pivotal Game 5 and then closed out Oklahoma City on the road to host the NBA Finals. (1) Orlando Magic over (1) Golden State Warriors , 4-3 The Warriors' magical run to their seventh Finals in the past 12 years finally ran out of gas at home in Game 7, similar to Golden State's loss to Cleveland in 2016. With Curry playing through a minor injury by the end of the season, the Warriors' potent offense operated at less than full strength. Orlando took advantage, unexpectedly winning the first championship in franchise history barely a year after upgrading their starting lineup with Bane. Paolo Banchero completed a breakthrough campaign by scoring 32 points in Game 7 and being named Finals MVP. He split votes with Franz Wagner , who averaged 22 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in the series while defending Butler. Interviewed on the podium by Lisa Salters, Banchero credited the victory to \"620,\" which observers interpreted as a remixed version of his native 206 area code."}

(1:52) BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Dawn Staley said she is convinced that NBA teams might never be ready to hire a woman as a head coach after her recent experience with the New York Knicks . Staley boasts one of the greatest coaching résumés in the history of basketball, which is why the Knicks interviewed her earlier this year before ultimately choosing Mike Brown as their new coach to replace Tom Thibodeau. Staley said she was legitimately interviewed by the Knicks and entered the process with an open mind, but acknowledged that she doesn't think the league is ready for such a historic hire. \"No, I don't [believe it will happen in my lifetime],\" Staley said Tuesday during SEC media day. \"And I hope I'm wrong.\" Staley, 55, said she accepted the interview opportunity from the Knicks because she has known team president Leon Rose and senior adviser William \"Worldwide Wes\" Wesley for 30 years. Staley, who revealed earlier this year that she would have taken the job if the Knicks had made an offer, said she emphasized in the interview process that the Knicks would have to be prepared to handle the scrutiny she would have endured if she had been hired as the first woman head coach in NBA history. \"If the Knicks have a five-game losing streak, it's not going to be about the losing streak,\" said Staley, a Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer who has won three national championships at South Carolina . \"It's going to be about being a female coach. So you as an organization, a franchise, you have to be prepared for and strong enough to ignore those types of instances when you're going to look to hire a female coach.\" Although she said she doubts an NBA team will ever make that move, Staley said the process with the Knicks helped her learn more about the possibility, which can help future candidates and NBA teams. \"If there is somebody that is interested in knowing and interested in being the first female NBA coach, I've got all the information,\" she said. \"Come see me, because I'll get you prepared for the interview. \"And if there are NBA franchises that are interested in hiring a female, I'm here, too, because you've got to be ready to take that on and all the things that it comes with because it's not just about hiring the first female coach.\" Staley's Gamecocks are ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press preseason Top 25 poll behind only defending champion UConn . South Carolina announced this week that Chloe Kitts , an AP All-America honorable mention last season, will miss the entire year with a torn ACL. Staley said the injury is a major loss for the Gamecocks because Kitts is \"irreplaceable,\" but she also said the injury will not end the program's title aspirations. \"We're unafraid of going into season without [Kitts],\" she said. \"We're not going to skip a beat. Our players know that when we sustain any kind of injury, we believe in the system that we put together. We believe in the players that we've assembled.\""}

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Delaware State Court. The two Suns minority owners are Scott Seldin and Andy Kohlberg, both of whom were holdovers from the previous regime under former Suns owner Robert Sarver. Seldin and Kohlberg sued the team in August, alleging that Ishbia has refused access to internal records. ESPN previously reported that the Suns sent a letter in August to Kohlberg and Seldin, in which the team said the two men demanded that the Suns buy their ownership share for $825 million, a figure that would put the team's value at about $6 billion -- a 60% increase from the value when Ishbia bought his controlling interest in 2023. The Suns said in the letter, which ESPN obtained, that they have no obligation to buy out Seldin and Kohlberg. \"When Mat Ishbia bought the Suns and Mercury, he couldn't have been clearer with investors: He was going to invest in the teams, the fans, and the community,\" a spokesman for Ishbia said Tuesday. \"Every investor had the choice at that point -- sell at premium or stay in and invest alongside him. Andy Kohlberg and Scott Seldin want it both ways. They don't want to invest in the teams, but they are demanding a payday significantly higher than what Mat originally offered, which was still over 20 times their original investment. That's not how it works, and we're confident we'll prevail in court.\" Michael Carlinsky of Quinn Emanuel, who is representing the minority partners, responded to the countersuit in a statement later Tuesday. \"Mr. Ishbia's so called 'declaratory judgment lawsuit' is nothing more than a thinly-disguised effort to thwart our clients' books and records litigation through delay; it doesn't actually 'sue' anyone,\" the statement read. \"That said, we intend to add our full set of counterclaims for damages arising out of Mr. Ishbia's gross mismanagement and dereliction of duties and will obtain the evidence that he has been fighting to keep from us.\" The August lawsuit from Seldin and Kohlberg was the sixth against the Suns since November 2024. The other five were by current or former employees. Some of their allegations include discrimination, retaliation, harassment and wrongful termination. During a Sept. 24 appearance on ESPN's \"NBA Today,\" Ishbia addressed the lawsuits. \"Obviously anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason they want, for anything they want,\" Ishbia said. \"How many lawsuits have we actually lost? The answer is zero. How many will we lose? Zero. \"The way I look at it a little differently than other people is we don't settle. We don't settle with someone. You want to say, give me $30,000 and I won't file a lawsuit? I say file a lawsuit. We didn't do anything wrong. If we do something wrong, we take care of people, but I'm not going to be leveraged by people.\""}

(0:42) The NBA vetted and approved a $300 million sponsorship deal between the LA Clippers and Aspiration in 2021, months before the green banking company signed a separate deal with star Kawhi Leonard that has triggered a salary cap-circumvention investigation by the league, multiple sources told ESPN. Two sources with direct knowledge of the arrangement said the Clippers submitted the 23-year agreement to the NBA for approval before it was announced in September 2021, as required under league rules because it contained a jersey patch component, the sources said. The agreement also included signage in the team's yet-to-be-completed arena in Inglewood, the sources said. In April 2022, Aspiration reportedly signed a separate, $28 million sponsorship deal with Leonard that was not subject to NBA review, per the league's collective bargaining agreement. The NBA is investigating whether the Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer violated league rules by circumventing the salary cap to compensate Leonard. Following reports of the allegations, NBA commissioner Adam Silver initially said he had \"never heard of the company Aspiration before,\" then later revised his comments to say he was \"aware of the brand.\" The NBA does not require teams to submit all sponsorship agreements for review. But some types of sponsorships, including jersey patches and signage that is viewable on television broadcasts, are subject to heightened rules or approval by the league. Sponsorships with companies tied to cannabis, gaming and energy drinks are also subject to league review. \"Teams vet their own sponsorship partners and negotiate their own sponsorship agreements,\" NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said in a statement to ESPN. \"Given the jersey patch's inclusion on player jerseys and its level of exposure across game telecasts, the league reviews and approves jersey patch arrangements pursuant to league rules that are intended to avoid potential brand issues or conflicts with league partnerships.\" A Clippers spokesperson referred questions about the league's process to the NBA. A sponsorship deal for a team's jersey patch requires explicit approval of the NBA, according to official league documents obtained by ESPN. The 2021-22 league operations manual specifies that a team \"must notify, and obtain the approval of, the NBA\" before entering into such an arrangement and that \"a team cannot announce any Patch arrangement unless the applicable Patch Sponsorship Agreement, Jersey Patch and announcement have been approved in advance by the NBA.\" The manual devotes roughly four pages to policies regarding patch sponsorship arrangements. It states that teams must submit such terms to the NBA in advance of any announcement. The manual even dictates a patch's size and location on the uniform, stating, \"The dimensions of the Jersey Patch may be adjusted slightly, as approved by the NBA.\" The manual also specifies provisions that must be included in a contract between a team and patch sponsor. One of those provisions states that the league or the team can terminate the deal if the sponsor \"becomes involved in any controversy or scandal that has or may have a negative effect on the business, reputation or the public's perception of [the team] or the NBA.\" In September 2021, the same month that the Clippers announced their deal with Aspiration , Ballmer invested $50 million in the California-based company, according to podcaster and journalist Pablo Torre. In April 2022, Aspiration reached a four-year, $28 million endorsement deal with Leonard, an agreement that an unnamed employee who purportedly worked for the banking company told Torre \"was to circumvent the salary cap.\" In an interview with ESPN , Ballmer denied that he had knowledge of the endorsement contract that Aspiration eventually signed with Leonard or that he directed the company to do so. NBA rules do not prohibit teams from introducing team sponsors or companies to players, but teams aren't allowed to be involved in subsequent negotiations. Per the collective bargaining agreement, the league does not review sponsorship deals with players. The Aspiration logo was scheduled to be on the Clippers' jerseys at the start of the 2023-24 season after the team's deal with Honey expired, but it didn't appear. In January 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Aspiration was the subject of a Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation into whether the company misled customers. At the time, the Clippers told Bloomberg that the team had terminated its sponsorship agreement with Aspiration \"last season.\" Aspiration filed for bankruptcy this March with a reported debt of $170 million. The company said at the time that it owed the Clippers $30 million, the most of all its creditors. In August, Aspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors said Sanberg defrauded investors and lenders out of $248 million by fraudulently obtaining loans, falsifying bank and brokerage statements, and concealing that he was the source of some revenue booked by the company. Ballmer told ESPN that he had been reviewing his interaction with Aspiration as part of his and the team's cooperation with the DOJ investigation into the company. \"These were guys who committed fraud,\" he said. \"Look, they conned me. They conned me. I made an investment in these guys thinking it was on the up-and-up, and they conned me at this stage.\" Multiple sources familiar with the league's sponsorship-vetting process said the review centers on the credibility of the company and its ability to deliver on its financial commitments. It's unclear whether the league conducted any further reviews of the Clippers-Aspiration agreement after approving the initial deal. The league has hired law firm Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate whether the Clippers circumvented salary cap rules. People familiar with the process suggested the probe could take months, perhaps not concluding until after the 2026 NBA playoffs. But those same people also noted that, per the terms of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, Silver is not solely responsible for deciding whether the Clippers will be punished, depending on the findings. Rather, Wachtell Lipton will present its findings to the league office, and Silver will have to decide, based on those findings -- or lack thereof -- whether to bring any potential evidence to a neutral arbitrator appointed by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, the people said. The arbitrator would then examine what Silver brought forth and decide the next step. The arbitrator could either grant Silver the authority to punish the Clippers or decide that there isn't enough evidence to merit any discipline and deny him the ability to levy penalties against the team. \"The burden is on the league if we're going to discipline a team, an owner, a player or any constituent members of the league,\" Silver told reporters following the league's board of governors meetings in Midtown Manhattan in mid-September. \"I think as with any process that requires a fundamental sense of fairness, the burden should be on the party that is, in essence, bringing those charges.\""}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

(0:50) SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD COOPER FLAGG had not yet played a single game for Duke when he walked into UNLV's Mendenhall Center on the afternoon of July 8 , 2024. But he piqued the curiosity of the future Hall of Famers preparing for the trip to Paris to play for Team USA in the 2024 Olympics. Flagg had been the most hyped and anticipated American high school prospect since LeBron James , who was the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft more than three years before Flagg was born. James and the rest of Team USA were quite familiar with Flagg's name, if not yet his game. It had been more than a decade since an amateur had been invited to play for the Team USA select squad. Doug McDermott and Marcus Smart were accomplished collegians when they received the call in 2013. This scrimmage at Team USA's training camp would be the biggest test yet for the teenage phenom. Would Flagg be intimidated facing perennial All-Stars he grew up watching on TV? Would he be jittery playing in a small gym with NBA coaches and executives surrounding the court? The answer: absolutely not. \"Zero nerves,\" 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis told ESPN, recalling his first impression of the 6-foot-9 forward who will start alongside him this season in the Dallas Mavericks ' frontcourt. \"He went out and balled.\" Flagg is back in Las Vegas for one last tune-up entering his rookie season, as the Mavericks play the Los Angeles Lakers in their preseason finale Wednesday night at T-Mobile Arena. But Flagg's welcome-to-the-NBA moment occurred 15 months ago about 2½ miles away, when he made it clear he could make an immediate impact in the league, although he'd have to wait a season to become draft-eligible. Flagg was already the consensus favorite to be the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft when he arrived at the Team USA training camp in Vegas. If there was any doubt that he'd go No. 1 in the draft, it was eliminated by the end of the scrimmage, when the Olympic squad survived a Flagg-fueled comeback to squeak out a 74-73 win. It only amplified the anticipation for Flagg as he headed to Duke, where he again more than met expectations, earning national player of the year honors while leading the Blue Devils in every major statistical category en route to an ACC title and a Final Four appearance. Now, after the veteran-laden Mavs stunningly cashed in 1.8% lottery odds to land Flagg with the No. 1 pick, the expectation is that Flagg can expand his game as a rookie while proving himself as the rare teenager ready to affect winning right away in the NBA. \"I don't know if it was about proving anything to myself or just feeling comfortable and getting confidence from that experience,\" Flagg told ESPN. \"I definitely just had that feeling that I knew I belonged. I knew I could be out there.\" WHILE STUDYING TAPE of Flagg doing everything at Duke, Mavs coach Jason Kidd wondered if Flagg could do even more. Kidd saw shades of another former Duke star in Flagg's game: Grant Hill, who shared the Rookie of the Year award with Kidd in 1994-95, when the 6-foot-8 Hill ran the point a lot for the Detroit Pistons . Kidd saw the same phenomenal blend of feel and force in Flagg that Hill had coming out of Duke. \"I saw that, too,\" Hill, who as managing director of Team USA invited Flagg to join the program's select team and called some of his college games for CBS, told ESPN. \"He tries to play the complete game. You look up and he's got 22 points and it doesn't even feel like he looked to score. He's so unselfish. He defends. He just tries to do what's necessary to win games.\" When Flagg arrived in Dallas, Kidd was determined to find out how he could handle point guard responsibilities. Kidd also wanted to see how Flagg would handle an unfamiliar role. That experiment started during his brief stint in the Las Vegas Summer League, which had mixed results as the Mavs split the two games that Flagg played at the Thomas & Mack Center. Flagg shot poorly in the summer opener, going 5-of-21 from the field, but found his way to put his fingerprints on the defining sequence of the win over the Lakers. With a little more than a minute remaining, Flagg swooped in from the weak side to swat a layup attempt, pushed the ball in transition, drew three defenders in the paint and dished to a teammate for an open 3-pointer that gave Dallas the lead for good. Flagg scored 31 points in 31 minutes in the second game, a loss to the San Antonio Spurs . The Mavs had seen enough -- especially pleased with how Flagg handled pressure while bringing the ball up the court -- and shut him down for the rest of summer league. \"He handled the situation as well as an 18-year-old could handle it,\" said Kidd, who started Flagg at point guard in a jumbo-sized lineup in Monday's preseason win over the Utah Jazz . \"He has a talent about winning. It is in his DNA, and so it would be unfair not to make him uncomfortable.\" THE MOST MEMORABLE moments of Flagg's time at the national team's training camp, according to Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, who was in charge of the Team USA select squad, didn't occur during the scrimmage. They happened during the few practices and meetings the select squad held beforehand. Flagg's inquisitiveness and intelligence impressed Mosley, who especially enjoyed an in-depth dialogue between Flagg and Magic guard Jalen Suggs about the intricacies of NBA defense. \"He asked a lot of questions,\" Mosley told ESPN. \"I think it's huge for a young guy in this situation to be able to ask the right questions. He just wanted to understand what it looks like at the next level. He's a communicator, and that said a lot to me about him. Guys like that with high basketball IQs that want to play the right way will ask questions.\" Then Flagg delivered a fearless performance in the scrimmage. \"He wasn't afraid of the moment and who he was going against,\" Mosley said. \"He was himself. I think he walked in with the quiet confidence, but then when he got on the court with those guys, that demeanor didn't change any at all.\" Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . If there is such a thing as a signature stretch during a scrimmage, Flagg put one together with a late scoring flurry as the select team rallied from a double-digit deficit. He hit a baseline turnaround from the left block over Jrue Holiday . He rose up from the right wing to drill an off-dribble 3 in Davis' face. And Flagg flew in for an and-1 tip-in over Bam Adebayo , eliciting a roar from the entire select team bench. Those three buckets came against a trio of defenders with a combined 16 All-Defensive team selections. Flagg didn't celebrate any of them, maintaining a quiet, focused sense of calm. He called his select team stint \"a big learning experience,\" but nothing he did against the Olympians surprised Flagg. \"He was cooking,\" Davis said. \"He definitely stood out. Guys obviously were hearing the name, and we all knew who he was. But a lot of guys tend to, I don't want to say be hesitant, but when you're going against guys like myself, Bron, Steph [Curry], you see these guys and it's like, 'Oh s---.' \"You look up to and you idolize these guys, and now you got to go play against them. You kind of get nervous, which is normal. But for him, he has the utmost confidence in himself.\" Flagg's scoring dominated the media coverage of the scrimmage, but that isn't what made the strongest impression on Steve Kerr, the former Team USA coach. Kerr was wowed by Flagg's command of the game at such a young age against elite competition. \"I just remember the force you felt,\" Kerr told ESPN. \"You immediately felt him. And it was as a basketball player. It wasn't just like he had a huge dunk or something. No. It was the passing, the cutting, the late-clock, left-handed jump hook on the block when the offense had nothing else. It was so consistent. \"I'm coaching against him and we have the best players. He's got incredible feel. He's just huge but plays like a guard in terms of reading the game.\" Kerr recalled seeing Duke coach Jon Scheyer in the gym after the scrimmage. \"I said, 'That had to make you feel good,'\" Kerr said. \"He just smiled.\" Kidd knows the feeling. ESPN's Anthony Slater contributed to this report."}

(1:33) We're a week away from opening tipoff for the 2025-26 NBA season with a few familiar faces and some new ones ready to take the court starting Oct. 21. Victor Wembanyama will be back and healthy to start the season after being shut down last February because of a blood clot in his right shoulder. And Zion Williamson will be back after playing in only 30 games last season for the New Orleans Pelicans because of various injuries. But you'll have to wait to see a few notable superstars debut this season. Los Angeles Lakers front man LeBron James is expected to sit out three to four weeks, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Plus, Kyrie Irving appears to be working his way back from his season-ending ACL tear last March. Before we get caught up in the whirlwind of the regular season, our NBA insiders provide updates on the injury status of key players and break down who is primed to make a notable return during opening week and who to keep an eye on as the regular season progresses. Zion Williamson , F, New Orleans Pelicans There was skinny Jokic. Then skinny Doncic dazzled on the cover of Men's Health. Now it's skinny Zion who has many buzzing about the Pelicans this season, as he appears to be in his best shape since looking like a once-in-a-generation prospect at Duke. Williamson credits Daniel Bove, the Pelicans' director of performance and sports science, for helping him transform his body through boxing and working out on a football field while rehabbing from a hamstring injury that plagued him all last season. In six seasons in the league, Williamson has played 60 or more games only twice and was shut down last season in March after dealing with a bone bruise , having played only 30 games. \"I really felt a shift in my body to where I would look at [Bove] and say, 'Dude, it feels good to feel good.' I haven't felt like this since college, high school, where I can walk into a gym, I feel good.\" -- Ohm Youngmisuk Anthony Davis , F, Dallas Mavericks Davis was fully cleared weeks before training camp, having recovered from offseason surgery to repair a detached retina in his right eye . He will spend the preseason getting used to the protective glasses he'll have to wear the rest of his career, per doctor's orders, as well as shedding the 15 extra pounds he carried into training camp. The 6-foot-10 Davis, now listed at 268 pounds, downplayed any worries about his weight, saying it's normal for him to report to camp a little heavy. \"I never want to come in at my playing weight, because then I lose weight during the season and then I'm too small,\" Davis said. \"I lose about 10 to 12 pounds very quickly. ... So I'm never concerned about that. I feel great. I'm moving great. I feel good.\" -- Tim MacMahon Kristaps Porzingis , C, Atlanta Hawks Porzingis has a new home in Atlanta and the center, after dealing with a mysterious ailment that allowed him to play over 20 minutes in only one of his final six games with the Boston Celtics , says he's feeling good again. \"Honestly, I still don't have an exact answer,\" Porzingis said at Hawks media day when asked about what was bothering him. \"They had some sort of explanation for it, but it was lingering. That was the toughest part. Some days I was OK, energy was good and some days, boom, I had a crash. I'm glad it's gone now.\" Porzingis played for the Latvia national team at EuroBasket this past summer and the center said the tournament helped him get back into shape for the upcoming season. The Hawks will need a healthy Porzingis to stretch the floor and provide a defensive presence at the rim for Trae Young and the Hawks to contend in the East. \"I don't know, maybe it was just my system needed some reset during the summer,\" Porzingis said. \"I was really happy I had this summer, got in shape, played the tournament, I felt confident again like I have the gas tank again.\" -- Youngmisuk LaMelo Ball , G, Charlotte Hornets Ball spent time in the weight room this offseason to get stronger. After playing in a total of 105 games over the past three seasons combined because of injuries -- most recently being shut down last season to have surgery on his ankle and wrist -- Ball is determined to stay on the court. So far this preseason, coach Charles Lee and Ball have talked about the star point guard stepping up and leading the Hornets more this season. Lee said he has seen his point guard show some of his leadership in the weight room by adding muscle. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"I've noticed a different commitment level in that area,\" Lee said at Hornets media day. \"Melo noticed that he is always drawing the best, most physical defender. At times, they made it difficult on him. \"So this year, adding that weight room piece for him was really important. ... I think he has increased his lean muscle mass, he has increased his weight.\" -- Youngmisuk Victor Wembanyama , C, San Antonio Spurs Wembanyama was limited to 46 games last season because of right shoulder deep vein thrombosis. It motivated him to push himself physically and mentally this offseason in ways he has never experienced. He approached the offseason looking to try unconventional training methods , such as a 10-day retreat at a Shaolin temple in China, replete with meditation and kung fu training, and spent time working with Houston Rockets icon Hakeem Olajuwon . Early returns look promising. He has bullied defenders in the preseason and swatted shots from all over the court. Wembanyama is fully healthy and has improved his body control, adding upper- and lower-body strength. And according to the 21-year-old, the chances for a recurrence of DVT are very low. -- Michael C. Wright Tyrese Maxey , G, Philadelphia 76ers After sitting out the final few weeks of last season because of a finger injury -- one of many maladies during a season that, even by 76ers standards, felt particularly cursed -- Maxey is healthy and ready to go for the start of this season. He played in the two exhibition games in Abu Dhabi last week and is on track to begin the season as the starting point guard. Given the number of other injuries Philadelphia is already dealing with, the fact that Maxey is ready to go will be music to the ears of coach Nick Nurse. -- Tim Bontemps Ja Morant , G, Memphis Grizzlies Morant's goal to \"play 82,\" as he stated at media day, is already in jeopardy. He's considered week-to-week after spraining his left ankle during practice the day before the Grizzlies' preseason opener. Morant's acrobatic game makes durability an issue for the star guard. That's why Morant, whose popularity is fueled by his high-flying highlights, declared last season that he is \"not trying to dunk at all,\" prioritizing protecting himself over entertaining fans. Since serving a 25-game suspension to start the 2023-24 season, Morant has played in only 59 games. He has been sidelined during that stretch by a variety of injuries -- shoulder, hip, thigh, knee, back, foot, hamstring and ankle. -- MacMahon Jaren Jackson Jr ., F, Memphis Grizzlies • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Jackson's availability for the Oct. 22 season opener is in doubt as he works his way back from an early July surgery to repair a turf toe injury in his right foot. The Grizzlies announced entering training camp that Jackson would be able to return to play in four to six weeks, putting the two-time All-Star's timetable in late October or early November. The surgery occurred a couple of days after Jackson officially agreed to a five-year, $240 million contract extension, but the Grizzlies' front office was aware of the severity of the injury when that deal was finalized. -- MacMahon LeBron James , F, Los Angeles Lakers James will make history whenever he appears in his first game this season, becoming the only NBA player to have played 23 seasons. But for the first time in his career, James is injured before the season opener, ending his streak of playing in Game No. 1 for 22 straight years. James is dealing with sciatica down the right side of his body, according to the Lakers, and won't be reevaluated for another two to three weeks and has been limited to light shooting in training camp thus far, sitting out every practice and preseason game. James hinted at the injury -- which was sustained sometime in late July or early August during an on-court workout, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania -- during the team's media day when he told ESPN, \"I'm not where I want to be [physically].\" James also said he would be sure to stay connected to the team while he rehabilitated. \"My presence is going to be important,\" James told ESPN. \"Making sure that even if I'm not on the floor, I'm always in tune to what we're doing -- so I know what's going on at all times.\" -- Dave McMenamin Zach Edey , C, Memphis Grizzlies Edey sit out at least the first two weeks of the season while recovering from offseason ankle surgery, according to the timetable the Grizzlies announced entering training camp. At the time, the team said that Edey could return to play in six to nine weeks. The longer end of that timetable would be the final weekend of November. Backup center Brandon Clarke also will sit out time to start the season while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery, so the Grizzlies will have a glaring lack of depth in the frontcourt. Memphis will have to rely heavily on journeyman Jock Landale , an offseason addition who has averaged 12.8 minutes while playing for three teams in his four-year NBA career. -- MacMahon Jalen Williams , F, Oklahoma City Thunder Williams initially suffered a fairly severe wrist injury -- a torn scapholunate ligament -- late in the regular season while grappling for a loose ball with Devin Booker in Phoenix. He played through it, estimating he needed nearly 30 painkilling shots during the Thunder's run to the title. That delayed surgery until July 1, attached to a 12-week reevaluation clock, which expired right before training camp. The team hasn't officially ruled Williams in or out for the regular-season opener, but he hasn't been in the contact portions of practice and has been spotted working only individually on the side, predominantly using his left hand. \"Still got some ways to go with it,\" Williams said at media day. -- Anthony Slater Shams Charania explains the significance of the Thunder locking up their core after Jalen Williams' extension. Jared McCain , G, Philadelphia 76ers Last season, McCain was well on his way to winning the league's Rookie of the Year award when he suffered a meniscus injury that cut things short after only 23 games last December -- adding to the injury bug that plagued Philadelphia last season. But while McCain is fully healed from that injury, he tore a tendon in his right (shooting) thumb that required surgery last month, an issue that will cost him time at the start of the regular season. Though the 76ers have plenty of guard depth, they also want to get McCain on the court with both Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe , the No. 3 pick in the June draft. -- Bontemps De'Aaron Fox , G, San Antonio Spurs Last March, Fox opted to undergo season-ending surgery to repair tendon damage in his left pinkie finger and recovered just fine from that setback, only to suffer a strained right hamstring during a summer workout that leaves in question his availability for San Antonio's Oct. 22 season opener at Dallas. Fox acknowledged he would sit out the preseason while expressing doubt he'd be ready to play in the opener. But internally, the team has been encouraged by Fox's progress. It's worth noting that San Antonio traditionally errs on the side of caution when bringing players back from injuries. It certainly helps that the roster features a glut of guards that includes last season's NBA Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and No. 2 pick Dylan Harper . -- Wright Dejounte Murray , G, New Orleans Pelicans Murray has spent six days a week in the training room, rehabbing and working his way back from a ruptured right Achilles tendon suffered at the end of January, and could be back this January. The point guard is eager to return after his first season in New Orleans was limited to only 31 games, as he was also hampered by a broken hand. Murray averaged 17.5 points, 7.4 assists, 6.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals after coming in a trade from Atlanta. \"I've been having fun seeing the progression, knowing that day it all happened, I just couldn't walk and couldn't feel my calf. It was a challenge and I accepted it.\" -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid , C, Philadelphia 76ers In a familiar feeling for the 76ers and their fans -- most unfortunately -- there is no bigger health question in the league than Embiid, and specifically his troublesome left knee. For more than a calendar year, it has been unclear when, or if, Embiid is going to be right again, and he reiterated that at media day last month. \"I've had so many injuries,\" Embiid said. \"The only thing I've always told myself is you can't give up.\" Though both Embiid and the 76ers are not giving up on the superstar center returning to the dominant form that led to winning the league's MVP award for the 2023 season, it remains unclear when he will be back on the court, be it at the start of the season or sometime after that. -- Bontemps Shams Charania joins \"NBA Today\" to explain why there is no set timeline for Joel Embiid to return from injury. Darius Garland , G, Cleveland Cavaliers After his postseason was affected by a turf toe injury, Garland opted to have surgery in June, one that is likely to sideline him for the first few weeks of the regular season. Garland said at media day last week that his recovery is on schedule and that he's running and doing on-court work. He remains out of participating with the team in practices to start the preseason, and isn't expected to be ready to play in any exhibition games. But Cleveland has made it clear that it isn't going to rush Garland back -- given the Cavaliers are hoping to be playing into June, and need Garland at 100% to do that. -- Bontemps Paul George , F, Philadelphia 76ers George's status for the start of the season remains unclear after it was announced he'd undergone an arthroscopic surgery after suffering an injury in an offseason workout -- an ominous sign after only playing in half the games in his first season in 2024-25. George, who has done some on-court work, said, \"I do think I will be at a good place, hopefully earlier than later. Can't get any worse than last year. That was a rock-bottom type of season.\" We'll see if last season was, in fact, as bad as it can get, but the 76ers will be hoping George can be back either by opening night or soon thereafter. -- Bontemps Kyrie Irving , G, Dallas Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd went out of his way to push back against the perception that Irving is \"ahead of schedule\" in his recovery from a torn ACL suffered in early March. But Irving's progress is evident, and he hasn't been shy about putting the proof on display with his post-practice work during media access periods. Irving isn't only taking spot-up jump shots. He's working on his legendary isolation game, making one- and two-dribble moves against the defense of a team staffer. He often takes turns with No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg during these sessions, helping teach the 18-year-old rookie some tricks of the trade. When will Irving join Flagg in game action? Irving, 33, doesn't want to set a specific target date, preferring to pour himself into the daily grind. The Mavs would be happy to have Irving back in the mix around the All-Star break, which would give him about two months to chip off rust and ramp up before the postseason. -- MacMahon Mavs coach Jason Kidd dismisses reports that Kyrie Irving is ahead of schedule in his recovery. Lauri Markkanen , F, Utah Jazz A variety of injuries, most notably a lower-back issue, limited Markkanen last season to a career-low 47 games. But he bounced back over the summer and looked healthy, leading Finland to the bronze medal game at EuroBasket with a 29-point performance that included 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in an upset win over Nikola Jokic and Serbia. Markkanen sustained a left wrist bruise during the tournament, which forced him out of preseason games and has limited him for a good portion of the team's training camp. Markkanen said he's rehabbing daily, feeling better, and making progress, but added he's \"not sure of what the exact date is when I'm gonna start\" playing again. -- Wright"}

The 2024-25 season's Most Valuable Player, Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year will have a Gold NBA Logoman Patch placed on their uniforms, which will also be removed and inserted into rare trading cards. The 2024-25 MVP, Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year were, respectively, Oklahoma City 's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , San Antonio 's Stephon Castle and Cleveland 's Evan Mobley . \"Imagine having LeBron [James] 's, [Michael] Jordan's, [Steph] Curry 's debut patch and what that would mean?\" Fanatics Collectibles CEO Michael Mahan said in an interview with ESPN. \"Well, the next generational superstar will have a debut patch -- the ultimate rookie card [...] And trading cards haven't been associated with achievement, success and accolades: We're [bringing] that into trading cards.\" Fanatics previously implemented the debut patch program into Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer. \"Seeing the success Topps had with the MLB [debut] patch is definitely something we wanted to replicate on the basketball side,\" said Josh Goodstadt, chief commercial officer of THINK450, the NBPA's licensing, partnership and innovation arm. \"The debut patch and gold logo cards [elevate] the storytelling and drive fan engagement with the sport and our players.\" Mahan said Fanatics has a partnership with grader/authenticator Certified Guaranty Company (CGC) to authenticate the patches. Fanatics also signed James to a deal in early 2024; like Jordan, James previously had partnered with Upper Deck for his entire career. \"It's going [to] be really awesome for collectors to have LeBron autographs on officially licensed cards,\" Mahan said. Mahan told ESPN that the company has plans for James memorabilia, as well as releases that honor achievements of NBA stars of the \"past, present and figuring out how to celebrate real success.\" Mahan pointed to Topps' celebration when Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw reached 3,000 career strikeouts this season. \"We did one-of-one autographs for him and every other member of that club,\" Mahan said. \"So, you think about important milestones coming up in basketball, the opportunity to do that as guys move up the scoring leaderboard -- we want to honor the history of the game: There's having a piece of the moment from the first and last times people step on the court.\""}

Which teams' big threes are on the rise, and which need work? ESPN's Tim Bontemps breaks it down in 10 tiers.", "body": "Iman Shumpert is looking forward to seeing how the Thunder respond after winning the NBA title. (0:46) The NBA might be in its depth era, but star power still wins the day. In a sport in which only five players take the floor for each team at a time, a concentration of stars has been a clear way to build a championship-level team. But even when a team doesn't have a trio of ready-made stars, looking at the top three players on each roster is a good way to measure both the short- and long-term health of an organization and where a franchise is headed over the next few months and next few years. With that rubric in mind, we not only have laid out the cores of all 30 NBA teams , but also ranked them in comparison to one another. And we've done so by taking into account both the group's present and future value -- along with the likelihood that these players will be with their respective teams for the medium to long term. Jump to a tier: A league of their own | Knocking on the door Best of the East | Ascendant young teams Gap Years | Old stars with big questions Changing the course | Stuck in the middle Starting a rebuild | Rebuilding Oklahoma City Thunder : Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Chet Holmgren , Jalen Williams Who else could be atop this list? Not only did the Thunder win 68 games and their first championship last season, but they also did so with one of the youngest title-winning rosters in NBA history. Then, to cap things off, general manager Sam Presti went out this summer and proceeded to lock all three of his young cornerstones into long-term contract extensions -- officially cementing the Thunder as the perennial favorites to lift the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the foreseeable future. Last year: Gilgeous-Alexander, Holmgren, Williams Denver Nuggets : Aaron Gordon , Nikola Jokic , Jamal Murray Denver is a pair of rough Western Conference semifinal Game 7s -- blowing a 20-point lead at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves two years ago before playing with an injured Gordon against the Thunder last season -- from having a potential chance at ripping off three straight titles. Denver still has the best player in the sport in Nikola Jokic, though, and a pair of co-stars who fit extremely well alongside him in Murray and Gordon. They both have delivered repeatedly in huge playoff moments. Last year: Gordon, Jokic, Murray The \"NBA Today\" crew discusses a preseason poll naming Nikola Jokic the best player in the NBA. Cleveland Cavaliers : Darius Garland , Donovan Mitchell , Evan Mobley The Cavaliers, like the Thunder, have a trio of prime-age or younger stars locked into long-term contracts and a team that won 64 games last season. Unlike the Thunder, however, Cleveland was unable to follow it with playoff success, losing in five games to the Indiana Pacers in the second round. That is why the Cavaliers are placed here and not even higher up this list. A strong playoff run next spring, and that will quickly change. Last year: Garland, Mitchell, Mobley New York Knicks : OG Anunoby , Jalen Brunson , Karl-Anthony Towns New York enters the season having moved on from coach Tom Thibodeau after reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years -- a clear indication that the Knicks believe this group is good enough to finally snap a half-century championship drought. Brunson and Towns are two of the best offensive point guards and centers, respectively, in the league, while Anunoby is as good as any defender on the wing on top of becoming an excellent 3-point shooter, too. Last year: Anunoby, Brunson, Towns Atlanta Hawks : Dyson Daniels , Jalen Johnson , Zaccharie Risacher For the second straight season, the Hawks have the same trio leading the way, all while the franchise has undergone a rapid and fascinating reimagining of the roster by newly installed general manager Onsi Saleh. Trae Young remains this team's best player. Kristaps Porzingis could be its second. And yet, both players are able to be unrestricted free agents next summer. Meanwhile Daniels was last season's Most Improved Player, Johnson -- if he can stay healthy -- is a popular breakout candidate and Risacher, although no Cooper Flagg or Victor Wembanyama , had a fine rookie season after Atlanta selected him No. 1 in the 2024 draft. Last year: Daniels, Johnson, Risacher Detroit Pistons : Cade Cunningham , Ron Holland , Ausar Thompson A year ago, there were massive questions about the Pistons' roster. They began with Cunningham, and whether he was capable of being the kind of star leader a franchise needs to become a factor in the playoffs. Cunningham responded with a brilliant campaign, earning All-Star and All-NBA honors for the first time while leading Detroit back to the playoffs for the first time since 2019. Questions remain about the rest of the roster, but there are several intriguing young players such as Holland, Thompson, Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren , who could all fill the remaining core spots around Cunningham. Last year: Cunningham, Holland, Ivey Houston Rockets : Alperen Sengun , Reed Sheppard , Amen Thompson A lot has changed in Houston over the past year. Thompson was a very near miss from inclusion in this group a year ago, and in hindsight that was an obvious mistake. The No. 4 pick in the 2023 NBA draft continues to blossom into a star and has a chance to take another massive leap forward this season due to the unfortunate torn ACL for Fred VanVleet last month during preseason workouts. Although I'm sure you're thinking, \"No Kevin Durant ? Really ?\" remember the purpose of this list. Durant remains -- at least for now -- without a contract extension, and Sheppard could be the team's starting point guard this season and remains a key player for Houston long term. Last year: Sengun, Sheppard, VanVleet Kendrick Perkins breaks down his optimism for the Rockets' offense after an impressive performance vs. the Jazz. Minnesota Timberwolves: Anthony Edwards , Jaden McDaniels , Julius Randle After advancing out of the first round of the playoffs once in its first 34 years of existence, Minnesota has now done so in back-to-back seasons, reaching the Western Conference finals before losing to the Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma City Thunder , respectively. The question now is how Minnesota will find a way to advance further -- especially with the Thunder looming over the West moving forward. The answer will begin with continued improvement from Edwards and McDaniels. Randle moves into the core after inking a long-term extension with the franchise this offseason. Last year: Edwards, McDaniels, Rudy Gobert Orlando Magic : Paolo Banchero , Desmond Bane , Franz Wagner Orlando's season going sideways last year when Jalen Suggs suffered a knee injury is a sign of just how important he is -- despite the fact that he, unlike Banchero and Wagner, is not on a max contract. But Orlando paid a king's ransom to land Bane -- a perfect complement to its three young homegrown players -- this summer, and Suggs is still sidelined with the knee injury, so Bane moves into the core for this group. The Magic's season will likely hinge on whether Banchero and Wagner can make improvements in their efficiency this season -- which, if they can, could lead to huge success in a wide-open East. Last year: Banchero, Suggs, Wagner San Antonio Spurs : De'Aaron Fox , Dylan Harper , Victor Wembanyama How do you get picked fourth and win Rookie of the Year, as Stephon Castle did last season, and fall out of a team's core? By that same team trading for an All-Star point guard (Fox) and drafting another (Harper) with the second pick after jumping up in the lottery, as the Spurs did over the past few months. How all of these different players fit around the one certain core player in San Antonio for the foreseeable future, Wembanyama, will be one of the big stories of the upcoming NBA season . Last year: Wembanyama, Castle, Devin Vassell Boston Celtics : Jaylen Brown , Jayson Tatum , Derrick White A year ago, Boston was coming off raising banner No. 18 to the TD Garden rafters and looked poised to have a real chance at claiming a 19th title. Then came Tatum's unfortunate torn Achilles in May against the Knicks in the conference semifinals. Now, Boston is likely to spend this season spinning its wheels waiting for Tatum to get back and give this group a chance to potentially be back in the title fight again in 2026-27. Until then, though, Brown and White will still remain two of the better wing players in the NBA, and the envy of most of the opponents they'll come up against this season. Last year: Brown, Tatum, White Jayson Tatum tells Stephen A. Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. Indiana Pacers : Tyrese Haliburton , Andrew Nembhard , Pascal Siakam Entering Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Indiana was likely going to be right near the top of this list after a remarkable playoff run that featured a series of historic comebacks fueled by the style of play coach Rick Carlisle and Haliburton have employed in Indianapolis. But after Haliburton suffered an Achilles tear in that final game of the 2024-25 campaign, the Pacers are also staring at a long 12 months until his likely return at the start of next season. One silver lining? Although Bennedict Mathurin fell out of the team's core thanks to the emergence of Nembhard, who had another brilliant playoff run, Haliburton's absence could give the former lottery pick a chance to reestablish himself with the Pacers. Last year: Haliburton, Siakam, Mathurin Dallas Mavericks: Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg, Kyrie Irving Things are drastically different in Dallas compared to a year ago, when the Mavericks had Luka Doncic and Irving together in a backcourt that was coming off an NBA Finals appearance. Now, Irving has a torn ACL, Doncic is in Los Angeles and -- after a stunning bit of lottery luck -- Flagg is the star of the show, playing alongside Davis in the Mavericks' frontcourt. It's all pretty hard to believe, even months after it all took place. Still, Dallas could have a chance to be a factor this season -- but that will require Flagg to instantly contribute, Davis to remain healthy and Irving to come back from his knee injury ready to go by playoff time. Last year: Irving, Doncic, Dereck Lively Golden State Warriors : Jimmy Butler , Stephen Curry , Draymond Green Last season, the Warriors went 22-5 with Butler and Curry both available after acquiring Butler at the trade deadline from the Miami Heat , and they feel they'd have advanced to the Western Conference finals if they hadn't lost Curry for the rest of the series against the Minnesota Timberwolves with a hamstring injury. There's little doubt this team has a very high ceiling -- if healthy. But given their core is all 35 or older, the \"if healthy\" question is going to follow this group around all season long. Last year: Curry, Green, Brandin Podziemski LA Clippers : James Harden , Kawhi Leonard , Ivica Zubac The Clippers had a very productive offseason, going out and landing John Collins , Brook Lopez , Bradley Beal and Chris Paul , and should get strong seasons from both Harden and Zubac. Questions about Leonard -- both on and off the court -- hang over this team like a lead balloon, however. Can Leonard, who has missed just over 40% of the possible games he could've played for the Clippers over the past six seasons, and played just 37 last season, stay healthy? And, with the investigation into potential cap circumvention ongoing, will that cause any issues for him and the Clippers? Only time will tell on both fronts. Last year: Harden, Leonard, Zubac Los Angeles Lakers : Luka Doncic , LeBron James , Austin Reaves The Lakers -- fairly -- believe a team led by Doncic and James can contend with anyone. However, that requires both players to be healthy. And with James already dealing with a sciatica problem that threatens the start of his season for the first time in his remarkable career -- plus his status as the league's oldest player, who is approaching his 41st birthday -- health is going to be a constant question. And that's before the potential shooting issues, as well as the perimeter and interior defensive concerns for this team. Last year: James, Reaves, Anthony Davis Milwaukee Bucks : Giannis Antetokounmpo , Bobby Portis , Myles Turner As ESPN's Shams Charania reported last week , Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee is a much-discussed -- and planned-for -- topic around the NBA. But as the season approaches, he remains a Buck, and he should be an MVP candidate this season if he remains healthy given how much he's going to have the ball in his hands. Although Turner slots in for Brook Lopez as the floor-spacing center in the core, the drop-off from Damian Lillard -- now back in Portland -- to Portis (or Kyle Kuzma or AJ Green or whomever you choose for the third person to be) is massive and shows why it could be a challenging year in Milwaukee, even with a healthy Antetokounmpo terrorizing opponents. Last year: Antetokounmpo, Lillard, Lopez Memphis Grizzlies : Cedric Coward , Jaren Jackson Jr ., Ja Morant Here's all you need to know about the state of things in Memphis: Jackson is recovering from offseason surgery; Morant is now likely to miss the start of the season with an ankle sprain ; Zach Edey is also recovering from offseason surgery; and both Jaylen Wells , No. 3 in last season's Rookie of the Year balloting, and Coward, whom Memphis leapt up in the draft to take at No. 11 this past June, ended last season hurt. The Desmond Bane trade reconstituted the Grizzlies' roster -- Memphis subsequently placed a big bet on Coward -- but this team can still go only as far as Morant and Jackson can take it. This is also another reminder of how fast things can change in the NBA, as it wasn't long ago that Morant-Jackson-Bane was seen as one of the elite, young cornerstone foundations in the league. Last year: Morant, Jackson, Bane Philadelphia 76ers : VJ Edgecombe , Joel Embiid , Tyrese Maxey Questions? In Philadelphia? Never! Jokes aside, obviously the elephant in the room is the health of Embiid, let alone that of Paul George . If the two of them can stay on the court this season, Philadelphia could be a factor in the East. But there's no certainty of when, or how often, we will see the two 76ers stars out there. George, meanwhile, is in the second year of a max extension that he signed as a free agent last summer, but he falls out of the core this season in favor of Edgecombe, the third pick in June's draft. Last year: Embiid, Maxey, George Shams Charania joins \"The Pat McAfee Show\" to discuss Erik Spoelstra being named the head coach for Team USA men's basketball. Chicago Bulls : Matas Buzelis , Noa Essengue , Josh Giddey This is a franchise perpetually stuck in the mud. One could argue the Bulls should be in a lower tier than this -- but that would be saying the Bulls are definitely going to be committed to bottoming out and rebuilding. History suggests they will win 38 or 39 games and be in the play-in -- which, in this season's East, is very possible. After signing a long-term deal this offseason , Giddey is a core player. Coby White , although the team's best player, is not as he enters the season on an expiring deal. Instead, the No. 12 pick in this year's draft, Essengue, is one alongside Buzelis, last year's No. 11 pick. Last year: Giddey, White, Patrick Williams Miami Heat: Bam Adebayo , Tyler Herro , Kel'el Ware The Heat are not a team accustomed to being stuck anywhere, but that's where they seem to be after yet another play-in finish last season. With Butler now having decamped to Golden State, the Heat are officially on the hunt for their next long-term star to pair with Adebayo. Perhaps that player is Herro, if he can make another big leap after a great season earned him his first All-Star berth. Ware, too, has a lot of promise as a super-active, long defensive big. But this team needs more if it's going to leap out of the doldrums -- even in the East. Last year: Adebayo, Herro, Jimmy Butler Sacramento Kings : Zach LaVine , Keegan Murray , Domantas Sabonis The seven-game series against the Warriors in the first round of the 2023 playoffs feels like a decade ago now. De'Aaron Fox is now in San Antonio, Mike Brown is now in New York, and the Kings have morphed into a bizarro version of the Chicago Bulls with LaVine and DeMar DeRozan back together again. Murray is likely to get an extension done with Sacramento in the coming days, but he's the one long-term bright spot on this roster despite missing the first several weeks of the upcoming season with a thumb injury. The rest? Either in their prime or aging out of it, and it's unclear what path this team will take from here. Last year: Murray, Sabonis, Fox Toronto Raptors : Scottie Barnes , Brandon Ingram , Collin Murray-Boyles Barnes was guaranteed to be a part of this core after agreeing to a massive max contract extension, but who would be alongside him? It turns out, it's last season's big trade deadline acquisition, Ingram, and Toronto's big offseason acquisition, Murray-Boyles, the No. 9 pick in June's NBA draft. Still, it's hard to see the long-term upside of this group to be anything more than what the tail end of the previous Raptors playoff team was: one good enough to make it and lose in a competitive first-round series. Last year: Barnes, Gradey Dick , Immanuel Quickley Charlotte Hornets : LaMelo Ball , Kon Knueppel , Brandon Miller The Hornets, now in their second full season under general manager Jeff Peterson and coach Charles Lee, will hope to see their collection of interesting young talent on the court far more often this season, after a number of injuries -- including to Ball and Miller -- precluded it last season. What the injury woes did do, however, was give the Hornets the chance to land Knueppel with the fourth pick in June's draft. He should be a perfect complement alongside Ball and Miller on the wings. The questions, though, are inside, where Charlotte is back to square one after sending Mark Williams , a core member last season, to Phoenix in June after the failed trade to the Lakers back in February. Last year: Ball, Miller, Williams New Orleans Pelicans : Jeremiah Fears , Derik Queen , Zion Williamson Williamson showed up for training camp in great shape for New Orleans, and the Pelicans hope that finally translates into sustained health and high-level play from him this season. But although Dejounte Murray and Trey Murphy remain in New Orleans, the man who traded for Murray and drafted and extended Murphy -- David Griffin -- is not. So, instead, the two lottery picks from the new front office, Fears and Queen, become core members for the Pelicans going forward. Queen will be fascinating to watch given all the attention around the trade the Pelicans made to acquire him, which included giving up an unprotected pick in next year's loaded draft to Atlanta. Last year: Williamson, Murray, Murphy Phoenix Suns : Devin Booker , Ryan Dunn , Khaman Maluach What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time, the Suns had a wildly expensive roster built around three big stars -- Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. Now, Durant and Beal are gone, Booker remains, and the Suns -- who have dead money on their books for the rest of the decade and none of their own draft picks under their control for the same time period -- are starting a rebuild. There are some interesting young players, led by Dunn and Maluach, but it's going to take time for Phoenix to turn this around -- and the Suns are going to need to show more patience than they have at any point since Mat Ishbia bought the team two-plus years ago. Last year: Booker, Beal, Durant Brooklyn Nets : Nic Claxton , Egor Demin , Nolan Traore If you need any hint to the direction of the Nets, look no further than June's NBA draft, when Brooklyn had five first-round picks -- and kept all of them, drafting Demin, Traore, guards Drake Powell and Ben Saraf , and big man Danny Wolf . They, along with Noah Clowney , a first-round pick two years ago, are the future in Brooklyn -- along with whomever the Nets land in the 2026 draft. Claxton remains a core member because he's on a long-term deal and, given he's in his mid-20s, should still be able to rediscover his prior form. Cam Thomas , on the other hand, is not, after he signed the one-year qualifying offer this offseason. Last year: Claxton, Clowney, Thomas Portland Trail Blazers : Toumani Camara , Donovan Clingan , Shaedon Sharpe There are few teams harder to parse in terms of their direction than Portland. The Blazers have a roster full of interesting young talents, such as Clingan, Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Yang Hansen . But then they went out this offseason and traded for Jrue Holiday and re-signed Lillard, who won't play all season. Will Jerami Grant start? Will Henderson when he comes back from a hamstring injury? Where does Deni Advija, who was arguably the team's best player last year, fit in the starting five - or does he? There's just so much noise here that it's hard to know exactly what Portland's goals are -- which will make for a very fascinating season. Last year: Clingan, Henderson, Sharpe Utah Jazz : Ace Bailey , Walter Clayton , Lauri Markkanen The Jazz, once again, kept the dubious distinction of having never moved up once in the NBA's draft lottery, causing them to land the fifth pick after having the league's worst record. Still, they wound up drafting Bailey, who spent all season as a consensus top-three selection, as the first move of Austin Ainge's tenure as the team's president of basketball operations. He quickly followed it up by landing Clayton, the national championship-winning point guard, with the No. 18 pick to make him a core player, as well. Walker Kessler , without a contract extension, isn't one, and Markkanen will look to get back to the form he showed two years ago. Last year: Markkanen, Keyonte George , Kessler Washington Wizards : Bilal Coulibaly , Tre Johnson , Alex Sarr Another team that had its high lottery hopes dashed in the lottery, the Wizards are once again committed to playing and developing their young talent. That's why Coulibaly, Sarr and Johnson -- their top picks in each of the past three drafts, respectively -- remain the top three players in Washington's core. This season, though, will be about continuing to see who can emerge from the many young players the Wizards have assembled, as they're now up to 10 players on first-round rookie contracts on their roster.

(1:01) A decade after winning the first of four titles to start a dynasty, the Golden State Warriors have seemingly been passed by the rest of the Western Conference. According to ESPN BET , the Warriors have just the seventh-best odds to win the West this season, behind the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder , Denver Nuggets , Houston Rockets , Los Angeles Lakers , Minnesota Timberwolves and LA Clippers . That placement makes some sense. Golden State was the No. 7 seed last season, bowed out in five games in the second round and could boast the oldest starting lineup in NBA history this season. If Buddy Hield joins Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler III , Draymond Green and Al Horford in the starting lineup after Hield's birthday on Dec. 17, the Warriors would be the first team to start five players 33 or older in a game, according to ESPN Research. But that quick, pessimistic summary severely underrates Golden State's potential. In contrast, the Warriors profile as one of the most dangerous teams in the West, even in their dotage, and they might even be able to compete with the omnipotent Thunder. The NBA's last repeat champion could be a sleeper that stops the newest candidate from repeating. Projections from ESPN's Kevin Pelton place the Warriors second in the entire NBA, with a forecast of 56 wins -- closer to the top of the West than to the play-in portion of the standings. What explains the discrepancy between that projection and the general perception that the Warriors' window has closed? Here's the simple explanation: In half a season with Butler, the Warriors were one of the best teams in the league, and they improved in the offseason. By that logic, they should be a contender again this season. Golden State upset the second-seeded Rockets in the first round and took Game 1 against the Timberwolves before running out of steam without Curry, who suffered a hamstring strain 13 minutes into the series. There's no shame in losing that way, as any contender would expect to struggle without its best player. Don't let the 2024-25 Warriors' meek playoff exit mask their remarkable in-season turnaround, though. Before the Butler trade, Golden State was 25-26 with a minus-0.4 net rating. But from Butler's debut through the end of the regular season, it ranked first in defensive rating and third in net, at plus-9.2 per 100 possessions. The team's 23-8 record in that span -- which extrapolates to 61 wins over a full season -- wasn't a fluke. With Curry back and Butler on board for a full season, there's no reason to think Golden State will be any worse this season. The Warriors should benefit from incredible continuity. Twelve of their top 13 players in 2024-25 postseason minutes will return in 2025-26, and they upgraded on the one departure ( Kevon Looney ) with Horford, who left the Boston Celtics in free agency. Horford's arrival in Golden State is crucial , as Curry has never played with a big man like the 39-year-old NBA champion before. Among Warriors centers since Curry's breakout season (2012-13), the leaders in total 3-point makes are Dario Saric , who made 74 3s as a backup center in 2023-24, and Quinten Post , who sank 73 as a rookie last season. By comparison, Horford has made triple-digit 3s in each of the past three seasons, and his 40.9% 3-point mark over that span is the best among all centers with at least 100 makes, narrowly ahead of Karl-Anthony Towns' 40.8%. His ability to stretch the floor will provide important balance next to Butler and Green, who can both be reluctant shooters. Horford is also a far superior defender and creator to Saric and Post, making him a better all-around fit for the Warriors' lineup. There is tremendous defensive potential in a frontcourt featuring Butler, Green and Horford, who have a combined 15 All-Defensive Team appearances in their careers. A strong defense, after all, is just as central to the Warriors' winning identity as Curry's deep 3s. In 2021-22, their last title season, the Warriors finished second in defensive rating versus just 16th on offense. And last year, Golden State led the league in defensive rating after Butler's arrival -- even without Horford, and even with their opponents making an unsustainably high percentage of their 3-point tries. Golden State should also be better on the other end this season. In 2024-25, the offense hummed as long as Curry was on the floor but fell apart when he rested; lineups without Curry or Butler placed in just the 5th percentile in offensive rating, per Cleaning the Glass. Butler stabilized those groups, though, and the Warriors ended up looking solid as long as one of those stars was on the floor. Age and availability could get in the way of that plan. Curry has missed an average of 15 games per season since sitting out nearly all of 2019-20, while Butler hasn't reached the 65-game threshold for NBA awards since 2018-19. The Warriors will likely struggle once again when Curry goes to the bench in games that Butler misses. Jonathan Kuminga , who is still a Warrior for now after a protracted restricted free agency , could play an important role as the best scoring option in no-Curry, no-Butler minutes; he averaged 24.3 points on 55% shooting in the Warriors' final four playoff games last season. Or Kuminga could improve the team by helping to facilitate a midseason trade. Kuminga is the only Warriors player with a cap hit between $12 million and $25 million this season, meaning he'd provide the necessary matching salary to get Golden State another sizable deal at the deadline. For now, though, it's unclear at what position the Warriors would need to improve. As the season approaches, they're operating with an enviable combination of star power and depth. Five different Warriors -- Curry, Butler, Green, Horford and Brandin Podziemski -- rank among the top 10% most impactful players in the league on a per-possession basis, according to the advanced stat xRAPM, which blends play-by-play and on/off data. The only other teams with more than three such players are the Thunder, Rockets and Cleveland Cavaliers . And behind that quintet, the Warriors have a mishmash of role players on the perimeter -- Hield, Kuminga, Gary Payton II , Moses Moody , De'Anthony Melton -- with various strengths, plus Post and Trayce Jackson-Davis to offer different looks as bigs off the bench. As Pelton notes about his projections, the Warriors \"have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team.\" Ultimately, the Warriors' greatest problem might not be anything about their roster specifically, but rather the context around them: The top of the West is much better than it was in 2022, when Golden State beat the injury-ravaged Nuggets, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks en route to the Finals. But even with that change, there are still major concerns for every team in the conference behind Oklahoma City and Denver. Fred VanVleet 's ACL tear should lower Houston's ceiling, perhaps by a considerable amount. Minnesota is relying on a number of rapidly aging veterans (38-year-old Mike Conley and 33-year-old Rudy Gobert ) and unproven youngsters ( Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr .) to support Anthony Edwards . The Lakers have a thin rotation and a potentially disastrous defense, and they're already dealing with a LeBron James injury. The Clippers face the same age questions as the Warriors, plus the possible ramifications of the Kawhi Leonard /Aspiration investigation . Even the Thunder, who don't even have any minor concerns, let alone major ones, could struggle to dispatch Golden State in a potential playoff matchup. The Warriors have consistently played this version of the Thunder tough. Over the last two seasons, Golden State is 3-4 against Oklahoma City; two of those losses came in overtime, and Curry didn't play in the other two. Butler wasn't on the roster for any of those contests. The Warriors wouldn't ever be favored to knock off the Thunder, of course, and they would need to navigate a minefield -- one of talented competition and their own age hurdles -- to get the chance. But it's not an entirely unrealistic proposition, and at this stage in their competitive timeline, a chance is all the Warriors can ask for. With James Wiseman gone and Kuminga halfway out the door, the Warriors' \"two timelines\" plan has been scuttled. It's all about the present timeline now, and maximizing Curry's remaining opportunities to add to his trophy case."}

Yet, in a traditional snake draft, getting both is essentially impossible given both are found firmly in the first round. There is a draft format, however, that absolutely allows you to pair SGA and Wemby. Or Nikola Jokic and Stephen Curry , Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo ... you get the idea. Salary cap drafts afford you the ability to assemble compelling collections of superstars. The mission of this piece isn't solely to explain how salary cap drafting works, but more importantly, share several actionable strategies to help you thrive in this uniquely rewarding way to build fantasy basketball rosters. In ESPN salary cap drafts, each manager begins with a $200 budget to build out their roster. Default settings host 13 roster spots, with the calculator on my laptop revealing this is a bit more than $15 per slot. You are welcome, of course, to spend well above $15 to acquire star-caliber players, leaving less for filler and depth. Create or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today! Sign up today! Instead of having a fixed draft slot to acquire NBA talent as you would in a snake draft, mangers rotate turns nominating players for bidding. As you might guess, the highest bidder when the clock hits zero lands that player on their respective roster. As my long-time colleague John Cregan once coined, \"your reign as manager begins with a wad of fake cash, a couple of hours to kill, and an empty roster to stock.\" Now that we have an idea how they operate, let's delve into some winning tips for salary cap drafts. The road to imaginary glory begins here. Leverage live draft trends as you prepare for your salary cap draft. Just like how we identify average draft position as a tool of differentiation and value in snake drafts, average salary performs this function in this format. Unlike how we enter snake drafts knowing that certain players will get drafted in a finite range of selections, the variance and volatility of player pricing inherent to a salary draft demands you identify which players you truly want to target with your imaginary coin. Which is to say, set not only price ranges you are willing to pay (within a few dollars) for specific NBA talents, but order players into pricing tiers. If you are the turn in a snake draft, your options are almost surely limited to a handful of top talents available in that range. In salary formats, you can acquire two typical first-rounders, or four players generally found in the second and third rounds of snake results. Before such expenditure, just make sure to have identified which talents in each tier you intend to bid for. In category-driven leagues, it's wise to prepare lists of players who thrive in distinct statistical categories; knowing that Gary Trent Jr . is an elite, and underrated source of steals. Or that Myles Turner can drive bold block results without tanking free-throw efficiency. No matter the scoring key, it's beneficial to list your top targets at each position, as well. Preparation is more crucial and comes with greater rewards in salary drafts, as average draft position doesn't do the work for you. While snake drafts can throw some surprises at you; a reach here, a player sliding there, salary formats are atypical in that each draft room behaves as its own unique market. Did the room hesitate to pay enough for a top star who is coming off a down season? Maybe he goes $15 or so below expected value, but that doesn't necessarily equate to a trend, as there could be a bidding war for him in another salary draft. Value is a variant concept in these drafts, so being adaptive and nimble is critical. This is why we can refer back to preparation; if you establish your targets at different tiers, statistics, and positions, then you'll be ready to act on players who appear undervalued in that specific salary market. Players closer to the end of a tier, or round using snake results as a comparison, are often where bargains emerge. There are a bevy of established investing strategies to consider for salary drafts. I don't believe it's prudent to lock into any one of these prior to the first nomination, but it does help to have an understanding of how some early decisions might dictate your path. Let's consider a few of the more notable approaches. The freedom of salary drafting bears the need for restraint in order to refine and define your strategy and player valuations. You determine which players best fit your philosophy, rather than a draft spot you often randomly net in snake rooms. Stars and Sleepers If you've identified strong interest in Luka and Giannis in your pre-draft prep and they both appear undervalued as the bidding approaches the final seconds, go for it. Just be mindful this pairing would still likely consume 60% of your total budget, leaving say $80 of your original $200 to canvass the remaining roster spots. Sometimes, as the early bidding begins, the superstars find you. Pro basketball is a space where heliocentric stars often drive impressive outcomes even with role players riding shotgun, as both Luka and Giannis' actual NBA careers confirm, so you can make this strategy of extremes work. It will just demand savvy waiver management and securing some sleepers in the draft. Snake style It's unlikely that anyone actually calls this strategy \"snake style,\" but I just did. The premise here is simple; you can mimic a snake outcome pattern in that you want one true high-dollar star -- or in this comparison first-round talents -- which in current live draft trends ranges from roughly $70 for the Joker and Wemby to $45 for the likes of Devin Booker and De'Aaron Fox . Assume downshifts in spending for each successive tier of spending, with second-rounders which can range from the $40s into the high-$20 range. Minding the middle I generally don't adhere to the aforementioned snake-like framework, as the power of salary drafts is the ability to identify, for instance, that you love the values found in the third-to-fifth rounds, allowing you load up on say five of such players. Then again, it's up to you how to navigate your spending. My most common approach; netting one high-dollar star and complementing them with a series of those mid-round gems we all admire. An example this year would include paying top-dollar for statistical anchors like Victor Wembanyama or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and then focusing on the likes of Jalen Williams , Desmond Bane , Immanuel Quickley and Evan Mobley at prices below what I project and expect their actual production will deliver. Sticking to your pre-game planning in regards to player targets, tiers and statistical specialists is far more vital than adhering to any of the approaches such as stars or sleepers or snake-driven spending. It's also important to note that you avoid what we nerds deem as price enforcing; engaging in bidding almost purely to protect the price point of a specific or multiple players. This is how you end up spending real percentages of your budget on players you truly didn't want just an hour before the draft. There is a very clear line between identifying a value and trying to police every bid. Your peers will absolutely get some great values during the process, but your team is paramount to those outcomes. There really should be a breaking point for when you stop bidding, just as you should feel comfortable trusting your pre-draft price points with regards to paying enough for talent you want on your team. After all, you will ride with many of your choices for months during the NBA marathon, so at least you can enjoy the team you wanted all along."}

Every year, CBS Sports ranks the top 100 players in the NBA , and every year, we inevitably miss some of the most important players of the season that follows. Take last year's list for the 2024-25 season. Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels ? Unranked. Breakout Rockets star Amen Thompson ? Unranked. Ivica Zubac made a late run at an All-NBA selection. He did not, however, make our list of the 100 best players in the sport. Inevitably, we end up with a bit of egg on our faces. We correct that a year later, of course, but the nature of the exercise practically necessitates mistakes. We can't see the future even if the list is meant to look towards it. Players often make the list based on expected future performance, but if we knew for certain which players were set to improve, well, teams would probably try to hire us because they don't know for sure either. A lot of the fun of the beginning of the season is seeing which players break out unexpectedly. So today, we're going to try to take a stab at figuring that out. The following 10 players did not make our top 100 ranking. But for one reason or another, they are players who could make us look foolish for excluding them, and then ultimately make next year's list as an apology. Of course, there are some pretty obvious candidates for a list like this, so to make it more interesting, we're going to exclude a few people. For starters, no 2025 rookies are eligible here. We haven't even seen them play. We're also barring No. 1 picks in the first five years of their careers (sorry Zaccharie Risacher ) and Rookie of the Year winners (so long Stephon Castle ). There's no fun in predicting when players like that will make a leap. No, we're looking for slightly deeper cuts here. This list includes just one top-five pick on a rookie contract, and he has played less than 1,000 NBA minutes. Meanwhile, we have two undrafted free agents, two veterans on their fourth NBA teams and another on his third, and a late first-round pick with less than 400 minutes to his name. So here are 10 players, some of whom have obvious paths, others who'd be coming out of nowhere, who could crack next year's top 100 list. Grimes very easily could have made this year's list. He averaged almost 22 points per game as a 76er ... but he did it as a 76er, which meant he did it for the most aggressive tankers of last season. Were those empty calories? Or signs of true growth? We'll find out this season as Grimes attempts to fit into a healthier and hopefully more competitive Philadelphia team than the one he played for last season. Considering his experience as a 3-and-D wing in New York, though, he should be perfectly capable of sliding into the background for the Sixers. Combine the role player skills from his Knicks years and the high-level scoring from March and April, and you have a no-brainer top 100 player. Are we cheating a little bit by excluding the No. 1 pick in 2024 but accepting the No. 3 pick? Maybe, but Zaccharie Risacher played real minutes last season. Sheppard didn't. Now, with Fred VanVleet out, he'll have to. He's fortunately in an ideal situation for his skill set. The Rockets can cover for his size issue on defense and likely won't ask him to handle the ball too much. But they badly need his shooting, and he should be able to get good looks in an offense led by Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun . Elite shooting can get a player onto the top 100. Payton Pritchard is the obvious analogue. We don't know if Sheppard is ready for that yet, but the Rockets wouldn't have taken him No. 3 if they didn't think he could get there. Everything is lining up for Sharpe this season. He's been a training camp standout by all accounts. He has Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard in the building as mentors. Portland has seemingly solved its defense. What it needs is a primary scorer on offense, and with Scoot Henderson out early in the season, Sharpe won't even have competition from another high lottery pick. This is his moment to prove that he can be a cornerstone player. He has the athletic gifts. If he can make 3s consistently and improve his decision-making, he's an obvious top 100 candidate for next season and a possible Most Improved Player this year. At his peak in 2021, Deandre Ayton ranked 51st on our top 100 list. We weren't abnormally high on him either. The Pacers gave him a max offer sheet, and then the Suns matched it. He has the tools to be a high-level starting center. Lately, he hasn't had the motivation. But how many times have we seen a down-on-his-luck veteran join a LeBron James team and suddenly rediscover his old magic ? Is Ayton really that different from 2020 Dwight Howard ? He's in an ideal position now. Between James, Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić, he's never had more playmaking around him. If that doesn't motivate him to play harder and do the dirty work, nothing will. But if we get the 2021 version of him in a contract year? It's not hard to imagine him making it back onto the list next year. Matas Buzelis flashed just about every important skill at some point last season. His handle needs work, but it was impressive for a rookie of his size. He was a league-average shooter last year on reasonable volume, which few saw coming, and he was a surprisingly capable defensive playmaker already. But you're not here for that stuff. You're here for the 6-10 dude with insane hops throwing down monster jams. The other stuff is what he needs to be a well-rounded NBA player. The hope is that he continues to grow as a ball-handler, that his shooting growth continues. If that happens, he has star potential. But that stuff takes time. What we'll absolutely see this season is this athletic giant running the floor and owning highlight reels on one of the league's fastest teams. He's already a nerd favorite. He'll be a social media darling before long as well. Our top 100, especially the bottom half, is stuffed full of 3-and-D role players. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has never been a full-time starter and he snuck into the final slot. Ellis hasn't had the widespread exposure that Alexander-Walker did on a contending Timberwolves team because he's been stuck on the Kings , but he's an absolutely ferocious point-of-attack defender who's made just under 43% of his 3s in his three NBA seasons. If he played for a normal team, he'd have made the list by now. If he keeps this up, not even the Kings will be able to hold him off from future editions. Last year gave fans a newfound appreciation for a very specific sort of role player: those who can't play significant minutes for stylistic and durability-related reasons but absolutely own the minutes they do play. Think of Steven Adams in Houston last year, or Ty Jerome in Cleveland. T.J. McConnell almost won Indiana a championship in 18-minute increments. You could make credible arguments for any of them making the list under the logic that they are absolutely among the best 100 players in the NBA on a per-minute basis. The one I'll call attention to this season is Lonzo Ball, who is a match made in heaven for a Cleveland team that badly needed more transition creativity and on-ball defense. If Ball can give the Cavaliers 20 good minutes per night, the specific things he'll bring are so valuable that there will be a strong argument to get him back into the top 100 mix. A lot of the ingredients we've touched on for other players apply here. Newfound opportunity? Check. Without Tyrese Haliburton , someone needs to handle the ball more in Indiana. Contract year? Check. A good year could make Mathurin a lot of money. Draft pedigree? Check. Mathurin was a No. 6 pick, and even if he runs hot and cold, the playoffs showed just how valuable he can be when he's hot. If you can score in the mid-20s against Oklahoma City's historic defense multiple times in the Finals, there's a very valuable player hidden in there somewhere. Now, with the Pacers going through a gap year, we'll see if Mathurin can discover that form on a more permanent basis. I promised you deep cuts, didn't I? Shannon barely played last year... but Minnesota trusted him enough to give him real minutes in the Western Conference finals. Alexander-Walker is gone and someone has to take on his bench role, but with Mike Conley aging fast, there's also going to be a juicy playmaking opportunity available for Minnesota's young players if they can seize it. Rob Dillingham , as the higher draft pick, would be the obvious suspect. He's younger and has more theoretical upside. But Shannon is immediately playable on offense and was surprisingly stout defensively for a low-minutes rookie. If you can score consistently without taking other significant skills off the table, you can be a very valuable player pretty quickly. That's the argument here. Shannon will have a bigger role this season to showcase the rest of his game, and there were signs last year that were pretty promising. The longest of our long shots, and I do mean that literally, as Huff has a 7-5 wingspan. There is a gaping vacuum at center in Indiana, and their system relies on having a big man who can shoot. Huff was over 40% last season on 12.4 attempts per 100 possessions. He's a strong shot-blocker as well, and he's quite the showman as a dunker. Is he a likely top-100 player? Absolutely not. Come on, he's barely been a rotation player. But you just know someone is emerging out of nowhere in Indiana this season. Rick Carlisle has an 82-game blank slate to work with, and Huff offers the cheapest possible replication of Myles Turner 's skill set. The Pacers will give him every chance to succeed. He's under contract for essentially the minimum through 2028, so if he is a diamond in the rough, the Pacers will have him for the price of a ring pop for the foreseeable future. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Al Horford stood in limbo for the majority of the NBA offseason as an unrestricted free agent. In the end, the longtime Boston Celtics standout made a difficult decision to sign elsewhere. He agreed in late September to a two-year deal with the Golden State Warriors , ending his second stint in Boston, where he won the first championship of his career. The decision was twofold, said Horford, who indicated that he and the Celtics had different priorities for the 2025-26 season. This late in Horford's career, opportunities to add another championship ring are dwindling. He already reached the mountaintop with the Celtics, but with Jayson Tatum set to miss at least the majority, if not all, of the upcoming campaign with a torn Achilles tendon, Horford's best chance of winning another title may not be in Boston. \"There was two things there,\" Horford, 39, said to The Athletic . \"I think the financial part was a component, but more than that, it was the winning part of it, trying to contend for a championship. And I think there was a lot of things up in the air -- and it just felt like they weren't in that same vision, obviously, because JT getting hurt, that takes a big toll. Up until then I was staying in Boston the whole time.\" The Celtics were in a tricky spot financially this offseason because of the second apron. They traded Kristaps Porziņġis and Jrue Holiday in salary-shedding moves and watched as key reserve Luke Kornet walked in free agency. The talent exodus was in many ways a necessity. Because of those departures and Tatum's potential to miss the entire season, the Celtics project to take a step backward from their perennial spot in the Eastern Conference's upper echelon. \"I think once that offseason happened and it started to progress, it became clear to me the team had different priorities,\" Horford said. \"Obviously, getting rid of Jrue, getting rid of Kristaps. And I know it's all salary stuff, but it was like a domino effect, and it was tough for me.\" Horford's exit is another blow to the Celtics, whose frontcourt became thinner with each departure. He left a legacy across two stints with the franchise as an integral part of the 2024 championship run and one of the NBA 's top defenders on an annual basis. He remained highly prominent in the Celtics' lineup even at age 38. Golden State is, on paper, a terrific landing spot for Horford. He was everything the Celtics needed him to be, and he should fit just as well with the Warriors because of his defensive versatility and ability to step outside the 3-point line on the other end of the floor. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Dallas Mavericks and coach Jason Kidd have agreed to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Tuesday. The agreement comes just over a week before the team's season opener against the San Antonio Spurs . Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Kidd, 52, served as Mavericks coach for the last four seasons and posted a 179-149 record over that span. That includes a trip to the 2024 NBA Finals, where Dallas lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. Prior to his time in Dallas, he spent two seasons as a Lakers assistant after three-plus seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks , where he went 139-152. He got his coaching start in 2013-14 with the Brooklyn Nets , where he went 44-38 in one season before being traded to Milwaukee. Kidd became the subject of several coaching search conversations over the past few years, and the Mavericks denied the New York Knicks a chance to interview him for their vacancy earlier this offseason. A Hall of Fame inductee as a player in 2018, Kidd faces a big season with the Mavericks. Dallas stunningly dealt away Luka Doncić to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February 2025, receiving Anthony Davis , among others, in return. The trade was widely panned , and things went from bad to worse in Dallas when Davis was injured in his team debut and Kyrie Irving later tore his ACL. The injury-ravaged Mavericks finished 39-43 and got into the Play-In Tournament, where they beat the Sacramento Kings but lost to the Memphis Grizzlies with a playoff berth on the line. Then the Mavericks' fortunes miraculously reversed when they won the NBA Draft lottery despite having just a 1.8% chance to do so. That allowed Dallas to select Cooper Flagg , the consensus player of the year at Duke last season who has already impressed in the preseason. With Flagg in the fold alongside Davis, Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford , the Mavericks figure to have a fearsome frontcourt defense, with Klay Thompson and Max Christie among key wings returning. Free agent signee D'Angelo Russell will be the team's lead ballhandler until Irving returns, if Irving returns at all this season. Dallas is slightly favored to miss the playoffs (-138) at FanDuel Sportsbook , though if things go well health-wise and Flagg can make an immediate impact, the team will likely field one of the NBA 's best defenses and contend for the postseason. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley has interviewed for head coaching jobs in the NBA , most recently with the New York Knicks . However, she doesn't believe the league is getting a female head coach anytime soon. \"If I'm the Knicks coach and you have a five-game losing streak, it's not going to be about the losing streak,\" Staley said during Tuesday's SEC media day. \"It's going to be about being a female coach. So you as an organization, a franchise, you have to be prepared for and strong enough to ignore those types of instances when you're going to look to hire a female coach.\" Staley said she took the interview with the Knicks because she has known team president Leon Rose for decades. The team ultimately hired Mike Brown, who was most recently the coach of the Sacramento Kings from 2022-25 and ended that tenure with a 107-88 overall record. Staley also interviewed for the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021. Ultimately, not getting an NBA job was not a big loss for Staley, whose Gamecocks have won two of the last four national championships. The NBA job interviews were serious, but Staley admitted she might not really have it in her to be that kind of trailblazer. She was also asked if she thinks there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime, and she wasn't feeling too confident about it. \"No, I don't,\" Staley said. \"And I hope I'm wrong.\" That being said, she would be happy to help any woman who wants to try. \"If there is somebody that is interested in knowing and interested in being the first female NBA coach, I've got all the information,\" Staley said. \"Come see me, because I'll get you prepared for the interview. \"And if there are NBA franchises that are interested in hiring a female, I'm here, too, because you've got to be ready to take that on and all the things that it comes with because it's not just about hiring the first female coach.\" © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

As bad as the Charlotte Hornets ' 2024-25 season was, they had a positive point differential in the 466 minutes he played with Brandon Miller and the 879 minutes he played with Miles Bridges . Ball is a wildly divisive player, but his vision and his touch are undeniable. This is his sixth season in Charlotte, and he showed long ago that he can lead an efficient offense. In the East, as long as the defense isn't dreadful, that might be enough to get into the play-in, especially if young wings Miller (the No. 2 pick in 2023) and Kon Knueppel (the No. 4 pick this year) produce at a high level. About that defense, though: The team's two best defenders -- Josh Green and Grant Williams -- will be sidelined at the beginning of the season, and, when Ball was on the court last season, the Hornets' halfcourt defense allowed 104.1 points per 100 possessions, which basically means it was hopeless. (As a point of reference, Phoenix gave up a league-worst 102.5 per 100 in the halfcourt.) Charlotte is alarmingly thin at center, with Moussa Diabaté, Mason Plumlee and rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner competing for minutes, and it's flush with offense-first guards, having added Collin Sexton and Spencer Dinwiddie to a roster that already included Ball, Tre Mann and summer league standout K.J. Simpson. You can envision a world in which the Hornets are buyers at the deadline, having shown the front office that it's worth adding reinforcements. You can also, however, envision them going the other way. Last year: Ball led all Eastern Conference guards in All-Star fan voting, but didn't make the cut because the players had him third, the media had him seventh and the coaches didn't vote him in as a reserve. After an insane late-November stretch that included a 50-point game in Milwaukee and a 44-point game against Orlando two days later, Ball was sidelined with a strained calf. Later he dealt with ankle and wrist injuries, so he ended up playing only 47 games. That was 20 more than Miller managed, as his season ended when he had wrist surgery in January. The Hornets were 8-28 when they traded center Nick Richards to the Suns in the middle of that month, and they were 12-36 when they tried to trade center Mark Williams to the Lakers at the trade deadline in February. That deal was controversially rescinded , so Mark Williams returned to a center rotation that featured Diabaté and Jusuf Nurkić, the latter of whom was acquired on deadline day from Phoenix along with a first-round pick in exchange for Cody Martin and Vasilije Micić. Charlotte finished 19-63, with the league's second-worst offense and fourth-worst net rating. The offseason: The Hornets drafted Knueppel with the No. 4 pick, wing Sion James with the No. 33 pick and Kalkbrenner with the No. 34 pick. They somehow picked up a future second-round pick by trading Nurkić for Sexton, and they also made yet another trade with the Suns, giving up Mark Williams (for real this time) and Micić for the No. 29 pick (which they used on forward Liam McNeely) and a 2029 first-rounder. In free agency, they reunited with Plumlee and signed Dinwiddie, both for the minimum, and they re-signed Mann to a three-year, $24 million deal. Las Vegas over/under: 27.5 wins, per BetMGM Hornets believer: The most important thing I have to say is that Kon is a pro . If you just watch Knueppel play for five minutes, you can see it all: The processing speed, the shooting, the off-ball movement, the competitiveness, the physicality. He reminds me so much of Desmond Bane , and I think he's the perfect kind of prospect for this team: He'll be a stabilizing force and solid complementary player from Day 1, plus he has star upside. With him and Brandon Miller on the wing, I feel better about the Hornets' core than I have in ages. In a few weeks, everybody's going to say Miller is having a \"breakout\" season, and it will only be half-true. Yes, I expect him to take a step forward, but even if he comes back the exact same player as he was before his wrist injury, his efficiency will tick up naturally because he won't have to carry a crazy load anymore. Hornets skeptic: I sure hope that's true about Miller. In his rookie season I really liked how he stepped up when Ball was out, but the numbers in those minutes last season -- 51.4% true shooting and 31% usage -- were discouraging. And with all due respect to Knueppel, the perfect prospect for this team would have been the guy he played with in college and went No. 1 to Dallas. Bane is an interesting comp, but what if Knueppel is more like Gordon Hayward ? I don't mean the younger, much more athletic version; I mean the one the Hornets had a couple of years ago. At this level, Knueppel's poor foot speed and generally unremarkable athleticism could be major issues, especially on defense. And if this team is going to continue to build around LaMelo Ball -- if you like, we can debate the wisdom of this! -- then the other guys need to be plus defenders. Hornets believer: You know what I meant about Knueppel. Winning the lottery would have been nice, obviously, but, failing that, it was ideal to get a player who will be at least a solid connective role player right away and could be closer to a primary playmaker down the road. Young Hayward isn't a bad comp in that respect, but Knueppel is much stronger than Hayward was at this stage. He was definitely a plus defender at Duke, and, unless Charles Lee asks him to press small guards 94 feet for some reason, I don't see quickness being much of a problem. Re: Ball, let me guess … you think the one-legged 3s are silly, he's not a winning player and the Hornets should just trade him? Hornets skeptic: I wouldn't put it quite like that. At this point, though, the burden is on Ball to prove that he is a winning player. Defensively, he can make amazing reads off the ball, but he's not always engaged and he needs to put up much more resistance one-on-one. Offensively, he might have the best highlights in the whole league, but the shot selection is still a mess and he still doesn't put much pressure on the rim as a driver. I want to see him improve his finishing, get to the line more often and generally be more intentional when he's initiating in the halfcourt. I also want to see him simply be available more often, as he's played just 105 total games over the last three seasons. Should the Hornets trade him? I mean, if I were them, I'd at least listen to offers. Given that he's signed to a contract that will pay him $46.4 million in 2028-29, though, I doubt they're getting a ton of calls about him. Hornets believer: We are talking about a 24-year-old who has already made an All-Star team and averaged 25 points per game in an NBA season. We are also talking about one of the most creative passers on the planet. Ball is far from a finished product, but that's to be expected. And between the injuries and the questionable decisions the franchise has made since drafting him, he hasn't exactly been in the best position to develop over the past few years. Still, he's gotten much stronger, and I've seen flashes of him improving in some of the ways you've outlined. Especially when Grant Williams and Josh Green get healthy, I think this year's Hornets will be able to put lineups on the court that minimize his weaknesses and accentuate his strengths much more effectively than they have recently. And in the spirit of being patient with young players, I must note that I'm curious to see if Tidjane Salaün is part of the solution in 2025-26. Charlotte knew he was a project when it drafted him, and he looked a lot more comfortable at summer league than he did as a rookie. Hornets skeptic: I'm not writing off Salaün before his 21st birthday, but I'm not getting my hopes up, either, and I'd be more optimistic about the Hornets if they'd taken Matas Buzelis instead. I'm glad you brought him up, though, because I sort of feel about him the way I feel about the team. As a prospect, Salaün's main selling points were that he plays extremely hard and has a high ceiling by virtue of his physical tools. In the same way, the idea of the Hornets is intriguing every year. Maybe Ball stays healthy and rounds out his game, maybe they turn into fun League Pass team that puts up tons of points and gets enough stops to string some wins together. But you can't seriously expect either Charlotte or the guy it picked No. 6 in 2024 to do anything serious this season, can you? © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put together one of the all-time great individual seasons for an NBA star in the 2024-25 season when he became the first player to win the league's scoring title, MVP, Finals MVP and a championship in the same season since Michael Jordan pulled off the same astonishing feat in 1997-98. And yet, despite producing a season we haven't seen in almost 30 years, I found myself on an island when ranking Gilgeous-Alexander in the top spot as the CBS Sports staff put together its Top 100 players in the NBA ahead of the 2025-26 season. That is because Nikola Jokić is busy rewriting history books himself, and he is a more than worthy candidate for that No. 1 position. The three-time MVP produced the best statistical season of his career in 2024-25, averaging a monstrous triple-double (29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 10.2 assists) and doing so on outrageous efficiency (66.3% true shooting). What I won't do here is argue against Jokić's greatness or insinuate he is anything short of an all-time great. I will state the case for Gilgeous-Alexander occupying the top spot for the upcoming season, as I believe we are witnessing the emergence of a superstar with similar dominance, but at the point guard position. Gilgeous-Alexander is the best version of the traditional, three-level scoring guard we've seen since Jordan. Even at his peak, Kobe Bryant didn't match the ruthless efficiency with which Gilgeous-Alexander operates as a high-volume scorer, never topping 46.9% from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander, meanwhile, has averaged north of 30 points per game in three straight seasons, shooting 51.0% or better in all of them. Beyond the efficiency, what separates Gilgeous-Alexander as a scorer from many of his contemporaries is his consistency. He has become the thing that separates the elite from just the greats -- inevitable. There are plenty of players in the NBA capable of great things in any given game, but an exceptional few who reach that level on a nightly basis. He has counters prepared for every defensive approach, allowing him to continue getting to his spots (and, yes, the foul line), scoring with efficiency, and keeping the Oklahoma City offense on track -- avoiding the pitfalls of grinding OKC's offense to a halt while trying to create for himself. He scored fewer than 20 points in a game one time in the 2024-25 regular season (an 18-point outing in the fourth game of the season) while scoring 30 or more on 49 occasions. In the playoffs, he had three outings below 20 points, while scoring 30 or more in 15 of the Thunder 's 23 playoff games en route to the title, even while struggling with his three-point shot against defenses trying to force anyone else to beat them. For as much as we discuss Jokić orchestrating everything for the Nuggets , Gilgeous-Alexander serves as an equally important engine for Oklahoma City. His 34.8% usage rate last season was third in the league, behind only LaMelo Ball and Giannis Antetokounmpo , with a key difference being SGA was doing so on the league's third best offense (119.2 offensive rating) -- Antetokounmpo's Bucks were 10th (115.1) and Ball's Hornets were 29th (106.7). It's exceedingly rare for a team as successful and efficient as the Thunder to rely so heavily on one player for creation, but that's a testament to Gilgeous-Alexander's abilities as both a scorer and facilitator. He pulls all of the strings for the Thunder and has learned how to toe the line between being an elite scorer and individual creator, while also keeping his teammates involved and engaged. Gilgeous-Alexander is tasked with making the right decisions with the ball almost all the time and does so astonishingly well, as his efficiency extends beyond scoring. He turns it over at a freakishly low rate, as his 8.6% turnover rate is the lowest of any of the top 20 in usage rate in the NBA last season. Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now : Gilgeous-Alexander couples that offensive prowess with high-level defense, operating as a plus-defender like a select few of his elite offensive peers. He led the league in defensive win shares last year (4.8), unquestionably a byproduct of a dominant team defense from Oklahoma City, but he plays his part in making the Thunder elite on defense both at the point of attack and as a versatile, switchable cog in the machine. That two-way ability puts Gilgeous-Alexander in a rare breed of superstar. It is what makes the Thunder not just a title contender but the runaway favorite entering the season. At 27 years old, the Canadian star is just entering his prime, and the terrifying proposition for the rest of the league is that it's possible he's still capable of being even better, with a long runway in front of him to rack up more accolades, titles and awards. Jokić is the current gold standard for sustained excellence as a superstar. He has three MVPs and two runner-up finishes in the last five years, producing stat lines never seen from anyone, much less a center. However, I believe Gilgeous-Alexander has a chance to pull off a similar run at the point guard position. He benefits from having the longest title window possible in the modern NBA with the construction of this Thunder team, but make no mistake, they're in that position because of him. The SGA era may very well be upon us, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's carrying the torch as the league's best player for years to come. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's not enough to have one or two stars. You have to have a team full of elite contributors. Every year, we rank the top 100 players in the NBA , and lately, those rankings have been pretty predictive of how that season plays out. At the time of our rankings last season, three teams tied with six selections apiece. They were the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder as well as the conference finalist New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves . Ironically, two of those teams, New York and Minnesota, went on to make a blockbuster trade after that list was initially published last September that pushed the Timberwolves up to seven selections, giving last year's Western Conference finals a total of 13 Top 100 players. Our previous champion, Boston, had all five starters ranked in the top 62, and the year prior, Denver won it all with four players in the top 75. The lesson here is relatively straightforward. As tempting as it is to fixate on the top handful of slots on a list like this, every single slot ultimately matters.

Antetokounmpo wants to finish his playing days in his home country of Greece. \"I'm 30 years old, I can play in the NBA until I'm 36-38. I'd like to end my career in a Greek team, why not?\" Antetokounmpo said on ANT1's The 2night Show . \"I don't want to live in the United States.

After a strong ascension with Utah -- he made the All Star Game in 2016-17, his final year there -- he joined the Boston Celtics via free agency. His career took a shocking turn when he suffered a dislocated ankle and fractured tibia in the opening minutes of his Celtics tenure. He returned the following season and played three seasons in total for Boston before moving onto the Charlotte Hornets . He had a brief stint with the Thunder in 2023-24 and retired in August 2024.

Ace Bailey , or at least his former representation, seemingly did everything possible to not get drafted by the Utah Jazz . Bailey reportedly had \"preferred\" destinations which may or may not have influenced a few teams that were in position to take him in June's draft. But Utah decided the talent was too great to pass up -- even against the looming threat of Bailey not reporting to camp or just being a general malcontent -- and took him with the No. 5 overall pick. So far, this looks to have been a very smart decision. For starters, there have been nothing but positive reports about Bailey's attitude. Teammate Kyle Anderson has called Bailey's positivity \"infectious,\" while coach Will Hardy has praised the 19-year-old's \"willingness to ask questions\" and ability to \"see the game and learn on the fly.\" With the obvious qualifier that we're talking about preseason basketball , and just two games at that, Bailey has looked extraordinary on the court so far. Over 70 minutes against the Rockets and Spurs , Bailey has put up 45 points on 19-of-29 shooting. Impressive numbers, obviously. But it's the way those shots are coming, within what is clearly a concerted effort on the part of the Jazz to put Bailey in his most optimal scoring positions, that is putting to bed what was one of the universal concerns about his game in college. That concern was that his offense came very hard . Everything was contested. Part of this was because Rutgers, outside of No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , didn't have anyone capable of drawing defensive attention away from Bailey. But it was also a problem that Bailey was so bothered by the pressure he did face. Now, when we say bothered, it doesn't mean he couldn't score against pressure. He could. And he can. Bailey's ability to bail himself out with tough shots was perhaps the biggest feather in his draft cap. But in the NBA , making tough shots off whirling spins into mid-range fades cannot be the first page of your survival guide. Sustained, efficient scoring only happens when you are operating in breathable enough airspace to access consistently clean looks. If you can't cleanly and consistently create that space for yourself, via your own handle (which is something we know Bailey has thus far struggled to do, as evidenced by his alarmingly high turnover rate against pressure in college), then it has to be created for you. And that's what the Jazz are doing for Bailey. Rather than asking him to start from a stationary position and create advantages in isolation, the Jazz are putting Bailey on the move so that by the time he catches the ball he is either already in, or quickly moving toward, open space. From there, he only requires one or two pressure-free dribbles to get right into a clean shot. This approach was on beautiful display in Bailey's preseason debut against the Rockets. 25 points 🔥 11-16 shooting 🔥 Ace Bailey was SUPERB in his preseason debut. pic.twitter.com/mpjXDFjDXR In Game 2, it was more of the same against the Spurs. Ace Bailey is doing exactly what he needs to do to start his pathway to stardom He attacks space off the catch, rises over defenders with solid form and consistency Not sure we could have asked for a better start pic.twitter.com/UHu3NVYUUy What you'll notice is that in all those buckets, only one came out of isolation (and even in that one he got to his spot at the elbow with exquisite efficiency and footwork, requiring just three dribbles punctuated by a luscious spin move). In fact, Bailey has needed just 28 total dribbles to get off his 29 preseason shots so far. You don't have to be a genius to do the math here. That's fewer than one dribble per shot. That is prime Klay Thompson stuff. Bailey isn't the all-time distant threat Thompson is and he's a better athlete, but the common theme between the two is that they're at their best when they're catching balls on the move rather than starting from scratch. Bailey may well evolve as an individual creator (in fact, he almost certainly will), and when he does it should allow him to get to the rim and free-throw line more. Some people are already saying they see a young T-Mac, which is lofty but perhaps not unwarranted. But for now, Bailey is clearly most comfortable as a mid-range scorer on minimal dribbling (a more athletic Rip Hamilton should have everyone in Utah very excited), and it cannot be overstated how smart it is that the Jazz are positioning him in accordance with that talent until the rest of his arsenal comes around. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

In the grand scheme of things, a team's opening night starting lineup doesn't have to be all that important. The starting lineup doesn't play the whole game, after all. And coaches regularly change that lineup as a season progresses for dozens of possible reasons. Who you are on opening night isn't necessarily who you'll be at the end of the season. But there's something symbolic about a team's starting lineup. It may not represent who the team actually is so much as who a team wants to be. It can represent a stylistic declaration. Are we a big team or a small one? Do we emphasize offense or defense? Are we putting our five best players on the floor or the five that fit best together? The season is a months-long process of exploration. By April, the teams that hope to be playing into May and June have hopefully used that process to figure out who they are and what they need to be to win at the highest level. The players you put on the floor to begin the season are your starting point. So with the season fast approaching, let's look at some of the teams that seemingly haven't settled on starting lineups, examine the possibilities, and try to figure out where they should begin the 2025-26 season. New York's broken starting lineup was one of the major topics of the 2025 postseason. From Jan. 1 through the end of the regular season, the five-man unit of Jalen Brunson , Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges , OG Anunoby and Josh Hart allowed nine more points than it scored. The playoffs were worse. By the time Tom Thibodeau accepted defeat, it was too late. The Knicks were already down 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals. He's now out of a job in part because of that lineup's issues. The first four players are seemingly locked in. The question is the Hart spot. The early favorite for it seems to be Mitchell Robinson , who missed most of last season but shined in the playoffs. The appeal is obvious. Robinson covers Towns' limitations as a rim-protector. Playing the two of them together elevates New York's offensive rebounding to where it was in 2023 and 2024, when it was at the top of the league. As Hart was rarely guarded on the perimeter anyway, the notion that playing two bigs would stifle New York's spacing is a tad overblown. The real concern for Robinson is durability. He's played 70 games once in his career and has appeared in just 48 over the past two seasons. If he's playing meaningful minutes with the starters and serving as the center when Towns rests, it's going to be hard to keep him below, say, 26 to 28 minutes per game. If the goal is to get him to April healthy, such a workload seems dangerous. He's never played 28 minutes per game in his career. Part of what facilitated last year's dominant postseason was the fact that he didn't play until the end of February. He just didn't have much time to suffer another injury. It probably isn't realistic to assume he can last six months as a starter. For this reason, a large slice of New York's fandom has advocated an alternative: Deuce McBride. It was a look Thibodeau practically never went to. McBride played only 82 possessions with the other starters last season. There are two reasonable holdups to boosting that figure. The first, and the one Thibodeau was probably most concerned with, is size. Playing two small guards with a center that doesn't protect the rim is potentially quite dangerous on defense. The other is balance. Bringing Hart and Robinson off of the bench forces a total non-shooter and an iffy shooter to play most of their minutes together. That compromises the spacing of bench units. But the benefits are potentially enormous. Offensively, McBride is too talented a shooter for opponents to guard him with a center as they did Hart. That prevents defenses from using three defenders against the Brunson-Towns pick-and-roll, which never quite gained traction last season largely because of Hart. If properly spaced, that's a potentially lethal play. Defensively, while McBride is small, he's a ferocious point-of-attack defender that's eager to get physical. Bridges is not. At this point in his career, he's more comfortable as an off-ball playmaker. Playing the two of them together would therefore pay dividends for Bridges, who has slipped significantly from his former All-Defense form. There's no perfect answer here. Whether it's Robinson or Hart or McBride, every option comes with drawbacks. The best-case scenario for the Knicks would probably be to mix and match. Mike Brown has 82 games to see how all three versions of the starting lineup work and how each starting lineup affects the bench units that would be attached to them. That was Thibodeau's biggest failing in New York. We don't know the right answer today. We just need to figure it out by April. If Fred VanVleet were healthy, there'd be nothing to talk about here. He'd be starting alongside Amen Thompson , Kevin Durant , Jabari Smith and Alperen Sengun . Now that he isn't, the Rockets have some soul-searching to do. Ime Udoka barely used Reed Sheppard last season. Rafael Stone's front office took steps to ensure that he'd have to this year. Sheppard, VanVleet and Aaron Holiday are the only real guards on the team. But jumping from \"barely plays\" to \"starting on a team with championship ambitions\" is a pretty significant leap. If Holiday were a bit better or they had more immediate access to their contracts from a trade perspective (many are locked until Dec. 15), they might not feel comfortable giving Sheppard the ball. As it stands, they may not have a choice. Fortunately, Sheppard's theoretical fit is strong. The Rockets just ranked 21st in 3-point attempts and percentage. They badly needed shooting regardless. Sheppard brings quite a bit of it, yet he won't need to monopolize the ball. If Houston wants a point guard who will get out of the way while Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun work, Sheppard can do that. He can space the floor as Amen Thompson soaks up more ball-handling possessions. That might be the silver lining to all of this. Without VanVleet, they'll have a far better idea of who Thompson and Sheppard are going to grow into when this year is done. Sheppard's size is a problem on defense, but he was an elite defensive playmaker in college. On this roster, with a nearly limitless supply of long wings, he'll be able to gamble a bit more frequently. Yet starting a player so young and so unproven would be fairly out of character for Udoka, especially given the defensive question marks that come with him. This is a coach who built around two centers that don't shoot last season. If he feels he has to start another wing like Tari Eason or Dorian Finney-Smith (when he's healthy), he'll do so. Sheppard is only going to start if he proves in camp that he deserves to. The Rockets badly hope that he will. Durant's individual offense was obviously a godsend, but this roster badly needed a low-maintenance deadeye shooter as well. So many of their bigger and defense-first lineups were just begging for an inch of breathing room. If Sheppard can bring it, Houston's championship hopes may not be as dead as many assumed once VanVleet went down. We can say pretty safely that we know four Laker starters when everyone is healthy: Luka Dončić, LeBron James , Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton will start. Offensively, you're in great shape with that group. Defensively? Well, it might not be quite as bad as it seems. Ayton was far better at his Phoenix peak, but it's possible a change of scenery reinvigorates him. James may be 40 ( and will miss the start of the season for the first time in his 23-year career ), but he showed last year that he's still a strong defender when he wants to be. Dončić is at least in shape. But still, that's two players who were liabilities last season, a quadragenarian and Ayton, who hasn't consistently tried on defense for several years. Logically, you probably want the fifth starter to be a defender. But who? If Marcus Smart is healthy, he's a former Defensive Player of the Year. But at this stage of his career, he's far better at defending bigger players than he is at hounding guards. He might also be better in a role that limits his minutes, purely from a health perspective. Jarred Vanderbilt can obviously defend guards, but he's such an offensive liability that the Lakers may view the tradeoff as a net negative. Remember, their strength is ball-handling more than spacing. Putting a total non-shooter like Vanderbilt on the floor neuters that ball-handling because it means forcing them to operate with far less room. The alternative here is to just embrace the offense and start Rui Hachimura . Good luck stopping that five. There's no difference between wins in the 100s and wins in the 120s. Starting Hachimura might also be necessary from a roster-building standpoint. He's on an expiring contract. Starting him pumps up his value if the Lakers plan to trade him to preserve cap flexibility. It also keeps him engaged while he's playing for a contract. The last thing they need is for him to grow uncomfortable in a lesser role. Hachimura was a full-time starter last season. Asking anyone to take a demotion, regardless of team needs, can make things uncomfortable in the locker room. This might be a fluid situation. Starting Hachimura early, while they evaluate what Smart still has in the tank and how they can milk any offensive value out of Vanderbilt, might make sense. The Lakers have a real history of making trades during the season as well. Their hope is that Smart or Vanderbilt eventually becomes their top defender. It's also possible that they find that player midseason, and starting Hachimura in the interim maintains continuity from last year's team. For now, that seems like the likeliest approach. Donovan Clingan is presumably going to start for the Blazers at center. One position solved. The other four, at least once everyone is healthy, should be relatively straightforward. Portland has a 21-year-old guard it drafted No. 3 overall ( Scoot Henderson ) and a 22-year-old guard ( Shaedon Sharpe ) it drafted No. 7 overall. They should probably be the starting backcourt. It also has a 24-year-old forward ( Deni Avdija ) it traded for and a 25-year-old forward ( Toumani Camara ) it traded for that were the two best players on the team last season. They should also probably start. Again, this should be simple. But Portland also traded for Jrue Holiday over the summer. Holiday, at this stage of his career, probably did not want to join a team competing for a Play-In berth, and he certainly wouldn't want to come off the bench for such a team after starting for multiple champions. His stature around the league is such that bringing him off of the bench could create issues in the locker room, though Holiday is the consummate professional and likely wouldn't cause them intentionally. There is at least an argument to start him early in the season while Henderson recovers from an injury. But further complicating matters is the presence of the declining Jerami Grant , who said at media day that he doesn't expect to come off of the bench either. The logical play for a team in Portland's position is to emphasize the youth. They aren't ready to compete for a championship yet, but there's talent in the building here. They just need to find a cornerstone player or two. Those four younger players all have chances to fill such a role, but their best hope of getting there involves starting. Henderson has started only 42 games in two years. Sharpe was removed from the starting lineup for a stretch last season. Yes, there's something to be said for forcing younger players to earn their keep, but at a certain point, an organization's priorities need to be in order. It's time to see what they have with these guys. Doing so is far more important than chasing a Play-In berth. Anthony Davis is a center. I know that. You know that. Everyone but the Dallas Mavericks seem to know that. Unfortunately, the Mavericks are the ones making the decision here, so the expectation here is that Davis will start alongside a center, either Dereck Lively or Daniel Gafford , immediately giving Dallas two big men who aren't real threats from 3-point range. Cooper Flagg will be the small forward, and fortunately, he doesn't really take anything off the table. However, if the Mavericks are going to have a functional offense, they are going to have to start offense-centric guards. So let's say that's D'Angelo Russell and Klay Thompson . Five years ago? You're feeling pretty good about that backcourt. Today, Thompson can really only defend big forwards, and Russell can't really defend anyone at all. So in order to even hit the bare minimum from an offensive standpoint, Dallas would probably have to accept an inability to defend the point of attack unless Flagg, as a rookie in a power forward's body, is capable of consistently defending guards. That feels like an unfair expectation. Dallas does have point-of-attack guards it could use. Max Christie , for instance, or against bigger players, Naji Marshall . But with offense at such a premium, removing Russell or Thompson would get iffy. Again, there's a possibility that Flagg just solves this. There have been some rumblings about him playing point guard, and if he can do that, it solves some problems for Dallas. But it's likelier that him doing so is a developmental tactic that helps down the line than an immediately beneficial short-term strategy. The Mavericks could address all of this by playing Davis at center. He and Flagg as the front court would still be a dominant defensive pairing. Thompson could defend forwards. Russell could play point guard on offense. The fifth starter could defend primary opposing ball-handlers. This is the best version of the current Dallas personnel. But to be frank, if the Mavericks knew how to optimize their roster, they'd still have Luka Dončić. They're committed to this double-big alignment. That's going to create deficiencies elsewhere on this extraordinarily unbalanced roster, and which deficiencies they choose to address and ignore will say quite a bit about what kind of team they're trying to put around Davis and Flagg. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Washington Wizards have won a total of 33 games in the last two seasons, and the rebuild is not over. Now that they've acquired three \"second draft\" guys -- AJ Johnson , Cam Whitmore and Dillon Jones -- they have nine players on the roster who were picked in the first round of the last three drafts. All that youth represents possibility, but it doesn't bode well for the Wizards' competitiveness in the short term. Neither does the fact that their 2026 first-round pick is top-eight-protected. This season, then, is about development. Veterans Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum are here to steady the ship, but the big questions are all about the young core: Where is the 20-year-old Alex Sarr's game going on offense? Can the 19-year-old Tre Johnson be more than a bucket-getter ? Can the 21-year-old Bilal Coulibaly and the 20-year-old Bub Carrington improve their spot-up shooting? And with so many 19-to-21-year-olds competing for minutes, can Washington start to carve out an identity? Last year: Twenty games into the season, the Wizards had defeated only one team: The Hawks (twice). And it didn't get much better from there: They finished with the league's worst net rating, worst offense and second-worst record. Midseason, Washington's front office made a bunch of moves, picking up two future second-round picks for Jonas Valanciunas , swapping four future seconds for a 2026 first (likely at the end of the round), absorbing Marcus Smart's contract to get an additional 2025 first and sending Kyle Kuzma to the Bucks for Middleton, AJ Johnson and a 2028 pick swap. The offseason: Washington fell to sixth in the lottery, where it selected Tre Johnson, a 6-foot-5 wing out of Texas. It then traded down from No. 18 to No. 21, where it selected Will Riley , a 6-foot-9 forward out of Illinois, in the process picking up the No. 43 pick (which it used on Jamir Watkins ) and two future seconds. The Wizards also acquired Whitmore for two second-round picks, Jones for a future second and McCollum, Kelly Olynyk and a future second-round pick from the Pelicans . Assuming Jordan Poole was not a part of Washington's future, the McCollum move was savvy: It sent Poole's (longer) contract, Saddiq Bey and the No. 40 pick (which became Micah Peavy ) to New Orleans. It then flipped Olynyk to the Spurs in exchange for Malaki Branham , Blake Wesley and a 2026 second, and it re-signed Marvin Bagley III and Anthony Gill to minimum deals. Las Vegas over/under: 21.5, per BetMGM Wizards believer: If you want to prove that you're not a casual, get it on this team now . Tell your friends that Will Riley is going to be the steal of the draft . Draft Bilal Coulibaly in your fantasy league. Don't just make outlandish claims about the potential of the Tre Johnson-Alex Sarr pick-and-roll; make outlandish claims about the potential of the inverted Sarr-Johnson pick-and-roll. Remember when Draymond Green praised Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington for getting the Wizards to play harder than they had in years? For a rebuilding team, that's the stuff that matters, not the record … which, admittedly, is going to be pretty bad again. Wizards skeptic: Playing hard matters, but accumulating talent matters more. To me, the Wizards are interesting because they didn't get Cooper Flagg or Dylan Harper and, as they position themselves to get Darryn Peterson or A.J. Dybantsa, they will be figuring out which of their young players are worth continuing to invest in. They've already given up on Johnny Davis , the 10th pick in the 2022 draft, and, while there should be plenty of minutes available for Carrington and Johnson in the backcourt, the wing rotation is looking pretty crowded. It's a weird roster in that way, and also in that there are barely any bigs here. I'm concerned that Washington still might not have found a real centerpiece, and that, with this odd collection of players, it'll be hard for the front office to even tell what it has. Wizards believer: People say this kind of thing about every rebuilding team. If you don't have the patience to watch these young guys, then don't! You can just tune in when the Wizards are playoff-bound and ascendant and pretend that you saw it coming all along. Personally, I think they're going to be a more mature, well-balanced team in 2025-26. Jordan Poole was fine last season, I guess, but I'm much more excited to watch Johnson with the ball in his hands. There's a ton of length on this team now, and there should be internal development across the board. Wizards skeptic: What kind of internal development, though? Will Sarr actually be able to finish around the rim consistently in Year 2? Will Coulibaly make defenses pay for ignoring him? Flagg would have changed everything for this franchise, but I'd feel so much better about the Wizards if they'd just wound up with Kon Knueppel . There is a long history of guys like Johnson -- tough shot-maker, not much of a driver, not much of a passer, not much of a defender -- flaming out. Wizards believer: Flaming out?! Johnson hasn't even played an NBA game yet, and you're predicting he's going to be out of here like Davis? Again, be patient! Think about the big picture. The Wizards have a clean cap sheet going forward, a bunch of extra picks at their disposal and a ton of young players with upside. They also have guys like Middleton, McCollum and Corey Kispert -- yep, still here, and still a solid role player! -- to tie lineups together. You can complain about the lack of bigs, I guess, but I like that Sarr will be forced to play the 5 and I'm fine with guys like Coulibaly, George and Cam Whitmore sliding up to the 4 spot. Wizards skeptic: I would have been fine with that a few years ago. Now more teams are playing double-big, and I expect Washington to get beaten up on the boards virtually every night. And while Kelly Olynyk wouldn't have done much about the rebounding issue, I kind of wish the Wizards had kept him anyway. He would have at least served as a connective playmaker and floor spacer, and there's a glaring shortage of guys like that on this roster. And to be clear, I'm not predicting that Johnson will flame out. I'm merely saying that, for a player with his strengths and weaknesses, it's in the realm of possibility. You can call me impatient if you'd like, but I really don't care what Washington's record is this season. I just want to know that the Wizards have found a real keeper or two. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Joe Mazzulla in the elite tier? Where does JJ Redick rank? We're assessing every NBA coach", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In a 2019 interview with John Gonzalez , Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr bemoaned his job title. \"From now on, I'd like to be known as a manager, if you guys don't mind,\" he said. \"Everyone calls me a coach. I'm a manager.\" It's a sentiment plenty of NBA coaches share. At that level, with the best and most intelligent players in the world, the things we think of as \"coaching\" represent only a small part of the job. Much more of it than we realize boils down to managing personalities and relationships. That makes the entire endeavor of ranking and evaluating coaches somewhat futile. A lot of the job is invisible. We occasionally get a glimpse into what happens behind those closed doors. A thoroughly reported feature here. A notable press conference quote there. But we're coming off a season in which multiple winning teams fired their head coaches seemingly out of nowhere. There are eight active head coaches with championship rings... but half of them aren't coaching the teams they won with. That doesn't even include Mike Budenholzer and Michael Malone, both championship winners this decade, both fired within the past year and currently unemployed. It wasn't even the first time this decade that Budenholzer has been axed. The job, for a variety of reasons, has never been harder. When things get tough, they are almost always the organization's first fall guy, and the standards are impossibly high. Tom Thibodeau came six wins shy of the championship. That wasn't good enough for the New York Knicks , who bet the 2025-26 season on the hope that Mike Brown can do what he couldn't. We may not be able to judge coaches fairly, but lately, it hasn't exactly seemed like teams are either. The reality of modern basketball is that almost every head coach is either on the hot seat or soon could be. So we're going to at least try to measure where these coaches stand in this new, job-security-free world. While there are a number of factors we simply aren't privy to, here are the traits we can at least somewhat evaluate: There isn't a defined rubric here, but all of the above factors will be considered. One last thing to keep in mind: the number of good coaches in the NBA today dwarfs the number of bad ones. As last year's firing spree showed, job security is only loosely tied to coaching acumen. A coach being ranked below average on this list does not suggest that he is bad. A coach losing games often says more about his roster than him. Most of the coaches in the NBA could win with the right talent. We are, to some extent anyway, splitting hairs here. With all of that in mind, let's rank the 30 head coaches entering the 2025-26 season. 30. Jordan Ott, Suns 29. Doug Christie, Kings 28. Charles Lee, Hornets 27. Mitch Johnson, Spurs 26. Tuomas Iisalo, Grizzlies As has become tradition on this list, the final spot is occupied by the least experienced coach. Jordan Ott is our only first-time head coach going into the 2025-26 season, however, in an occurrence we're unlikely to ever see again, there are four separate head coaches who took over on an interim basis in the middle of last season and are now entering their first training camps as head coaches even though they've coached games. Ott is a perfectly qualified first-time head coach, though given Mat Ishbia's insistence on hiring within the Michigan State family, the onus is going to be on him to prove he's the right man for the job in Phoenix. The Kings had a better record under Doug Christie last season (27-24) than they did under Mike Brown (13-18), but their net rating actually dropped slightly from 1.6 to 0.0 after the coaching change. Brown was the victim of poor clutch luck and a star that was clearly on the way out. Christie had to wade through the mess of the De'Aaron Fox trade as well the standard Sacramento nonsense, so he shouldn't be judged too harshly, but there wasn't too much to latch onto in his first few months on the job. Sacramento's defense took a meaningful step back in Brown's absence, which is unsurprising given his stellar defensive track record, and a home Play-In loss to a Mavericks team that was more or less without guards was pretty discouraging. There's no fair way to judge Charles Lee on his first season in Charlotte. He took over a pretty limited and extremely young roster that dealt with injuries to basically every notable player and one of the strangest mid-season distractions in recent memory (the cancelled Mark Williams trade). There were some promising indicators when it comes to process. Charlotte largely took the right shots, finishing above league average in 3-point rate and mostly eschewing long-2s. The defense vastly over performed with Moussa Diabaté at center, something to watch this season with no entrenched veterans ahead of him. For now, think of Lee as you would any other promising young coach. Speaking of bizarre circumstances, Mitch Johnson took over for perhaps the greatest coach in NBA history in the middle of the season for a team that made a blockbuster trade in February and then lost its best player to a rare medical issue. There's not nearly enough high-stakes basketball to render any real judgment here, but there were some really promising signs here as well. The Spurs finished eighth in the NBA in 3-point attempt rate, for instance, and while Popovich had already been trending back in that direction, a lot of his late tenure in San Antonio was marked by poor team-wide shot diets. We'll have a much better idea of what sort of coach Johnson will be after this season, but they were reasonably competitive before Victor Wembanyama went down, so it's not hard to imagine him jumping pretty meaningfully next year. Already working in his favor: San Antonio had the second-most efficient offense after timeouts in the NBA last season. The Grizzlies didn't have the players last season to make much postseason noise, and they still probably don't, but Tuomas Iisalo made a good first impression given the pieces that he had. He obviously won points with key players for introducing more pick-and-roll back into an offense that totally abandoned it as they revamped their system last year, but he's clearly a creative schematic mind on both ends of the floor. Using Zach Edey to guard Jimmy Butler , for example, was a bold step very few coaches, let alone coaches trying to prove they deserve a job in a postseason game, would take. Did it work? More than the stats suggest, less than the Grizzlies hoped, but having a coach who's willing to take risks and experiment matters. It seems as though the Grizzlies have one.

There's only so much you can do with a team that is tanking as nakedly as Washington, but with a year and a half on the job, you'd hope to see a bit more of a coach's imprint on a team than we've seen with the Wizards . They certainly improved down the stretch, so it's encouraging to see that Keefe has managed to ward off the sort of losing culture that so often follows tanks like this. But the Wizards haven't established a definable playing style yet, and given how raw so many of their youngsters are, it might be a while before they do. In April, The Athletic released its annual anonymous player poll, and Keefe won the worst coach category with 24.7% of the vote. Willie Green deserves some measure of sympathy. He had a healthy team for, what, three months? The Pelicans were good during that brief stretch of the 2023-24 season. Otherwise, injuries have doomed his tenure in New Orleans. Still, he hasn't helped matters lately. The Pelicans never shoot 3s, and that was true even when they had the NBA 's best shooting coach in Fred Vinson. He never quite figured out how to get Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram to coexist, and a lot of their bad habits persisted under his watch. It seems notable that the Pelicans did not allow James Borrego to interview as associate head coach for the Knicks this offseason. They were under no obligation to. It would have been a lateral move, and there's no defined industry standard on that front. But teams will reasonably often allow assistants to move in the best interests of their career, and Borrego could have sold himself as a future head coach far more easily on a winning Knicks team than he will on the rebuilding Pelicans. Yet New Orleans held onto Borrego. It's hard not to read that as the Pelicans wanting to keep a potential interim coach or even a permanent replacement in the building. Darko Rajakovic is in the same boat as Keefe. He's had two full years on the job, so we can't say there's no information here, but they've been two years of roster overhauls, injuries and tanking. The Raptors were indeed bad last season, but not as bad as you think. They went 48-33-1 against the spread last season, covering 59.3% of their games. Only the Thunder covered more. The Raptors played close games. They just lost them because they usually had worse players. But they played hard even with nothing to play for, especially down the stretch, when their defense came alive and ranked second in the league after the All-Star break. Offense remains an issue, though in fairness, Rajakovic has at least tried to make up for Toronto's lack of individual creation with solid ball-movement. The Raptors have ranked sixth in the NBA in passes in both of his seasons on the job. There's promise here. It's just hard to judge a coach in mostly low-stakes games. You know the Doc Rivers shtick by now. He's been doing this for 25 years. His teams run predictable offenses and ignore the offensive glass. His defenses lately have left plenty to be desired, and those uninspiring tactics are probably responsible for some of his blown 3-1 leads. Above all else, Rivers is great at getting jobs. Owners love him. Stars, at least early on, love him. But it also feels notable that in that Athletic poll, Rivers, came in third with 12.7% of the vote for worst coach, and unlike Keefe, he couldn't fall back on limited experience or poor rosters. Whether he's wearing on players with time or if there are simply some types of players that don't mesh well with his style is unclear, but his reputation has taken plenty of hits in recent years, and it doesn't help that so often makes excuses for his shortcomings. Considering the talent he's had since leaving Boston, his failure to even reach a conference finals is extremely disappointing. 21. Chauncey Billups, Trail Blazers 20. JB Bickerstaff, Pistons 19. Billy Donovan, Bulls 18. Mike Brown, Knicks 17. Jason Kidd, Mavericks 16. Jamahl Mosley, Magic Chauncey Billups entered last season on a scorching hot seat. He left it with an extension after a strong finish in which Portland went .500 in its last 26 games and played some of the best second-half defense in basketball. Like Toronto, Portland benefitted from a relatively easy schedule to power that late-season success, but the Blazers doubled down on it by trading for Jrue Holiday . They expect to be competitive this season in a strong Western Conference. The defense can probably hold up its end of the bargain. Can the offense? The Blazers have struggled on basically every front offensively under BIllups besides offensive rebounding. Portland is the only team to rate in the bottom five in the NBA in points per possession on after timeout plays in each of the past two seasons, which isn't a great look for a coach who's drawing those plays up. His old-school lineup tendencies should raise eyebrows as well. Scoot Henderson was the No. 3 overall pick. That he's started 42 games in two years doesn't show a strong enough commitment to player development and allowing a youngster to work through his mistakes on the court. Removing the similarly gifted Shaedon Sharpe from the starting five midseason last year was a similar head-scratcher, though he eventually made it back. Yes, there's something to be said for forcing young players to earn their keep, but this was an example of a coach's short-term priorities conflicting with the best long-term interests of the franchise. Balancing those needs this season will be critical for Billups. JB Bickerstaff specializes in one sort of coaching job, but he does it exceedingly well. When you need a coach to take over a young team and professionalize it, he's your man. Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell trade was only feasible because he helped rebuild the Cavaliers far faster than anyone anticipated. Detroit's 30-win jump last season speaks for itself. There's something to be said for a coach who can immediately come in and create a create a winning culture. He takes teams from Point A to Point B. It's that next step that's proven problematic. Bickerstaff's playoff track record, though brief, is disappointing. The 2023 loss to the Knicks was a disaster. Last year's loss was more defensible as a lower seed with a younger roster, but that was a winnable series. The reporting surrounding the 2023-24 season made it clear that he'd lost Cleveland's locker room. We know he can coach young players. In Detroit, we'll find out in the coming years if he's equipped to turn veterans into real contenders. Kenny Atkinson taking over nearly the same Cleveland roster and turning it into a juggernaut was fairly damning. Schematically, he left Bickerstaff's stodgy offense in the dust. Give Billy Donovan this: he coaches the team he has, not the team he wants. When he had DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , he let them pound the rock. When the roster skewed younger, faster and more eager to shoot, he played into its strengths. The Bulls were the NBA 's second-fastest team last season, and they took the the third-most 3s. Even in Oklahoma City, when three of his best players were point guards, he just played three point guards. Far too many coaches fixate on the sort of style they'd prefer to run. That's never been a flaw of Donovan's. Unfortunately, the teams he's had have been largely underwhelming since he arrived in Chicago, so that's made it difficult to truly evaluate him against the league's best. Mike Brown teams always defend. Even the defensively inept Kings rosters of the past few seasons have hovered around league-average. Offense has usually been the problem. His bizarre decision to try to implement the Princeton offense with the 2012-13 Lakers was a contributor to his stunning dismissal only five games into the season. The 2022-23 Kings, who posted historic numbers, were far more modern. But the league seemingly caught up a year later. Suddenly, the Kings couldn't get to the basket to save their lives, and Brown couldn't adjust. Some of last year's decisions were downright bizarre. Why exactly was he bringing Keon Ellis off of the bench when he was the only reliable 3-and-D player on the team? As offensive creativity and better lineup management were two of the major reasons the Knicks fired Tom Thibodeau, Brown will be put to the test early and often this season, though the early preseason returns have been encouraging. Judging Jason Kidd as a coach feels almost impossible. His teams never play to expectations. They're either way better or way worse than you think they'll be. The Bucks were a mess when he took them over. They immediately made the playoffs only to backslide and eventually get fixed by Mike Budenholzer. At first, the Mavericks were on the same trajectory: great in his debut season as they raced to the 2022 Western Conference finals, disappointing in a lottery follow-up. He bucked that trend by making the 2024 Finals. His playoff success has largely come on the back of stellar defensive game-planning. His offenses never move the ball and have fairly inconsistent shot selection. How much of that is him vs. the players he has? A Luka Dončić is really only going to play one way. Speaking of which... do we dock points for Kidd not throwing his body in front of the Dončić trade? We don't quite know how much of a participant he was in that debacle. Without him this year, though, we'll get a much cleaner look at what sort of offensive vision Kidd has without the NBA's most heliocentric ball-handler. He'll need a good one to compensate for this unbalanced roster. Jamahl Mosley rounds out this group of strong defensive coaches with serious offensive question marks. He's just at the extreme end of both spectrums. The Magic had the No. 2 defense in the NBA last season despite everyone being injured. They also ranked 27th in offense. Mosley has never topped 22nd. The Magic had the dubious distinction of being the worst after-timeout offense in the NBA last season, never a good look for a coach. They shoot too many long 2s and not nearly enough 3s. They're below league average in passing every year. Obviously, some of this is roster-related. The Magic prioritize big wings more than skilled scorers, and injuries have forced Mosley to try to make lemonade out of the lemons he's so often had. He should be commended for that. The Magic have, by and large, overperformed on his watch, and getting young, offense-centric prospects like Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner to take the sort of pride in playing defense that he has is extremely encouraging. But you can't be in the top half of a list like this without once having coached a decent offense. With Desmond Bane in place, maybe this is the year Mosley does so. 15. David Adelman, Nuggets 14. Jordi Fernandez, Nets 13. JJ Redick, Lakers David Adelman is the only coach in NBA history with more playoff wins (seven) than regular-season wins (three). That will soon change, and frankly, his ranking likely will as well. His postseason was so encouraging that if his upcoming regular season goes as expected, he may well be a top-10 coach next year. He effectively beat the Clippers with six players. His zone defense nearly confounded the Thunder in the second round. He was widely credited for designing Denver's offense even as an assistant. The sample is the only thing keeping him here. We can't anoint a coach after two months of work. But Adelman's start was stellar. The Nuggets vastly outperformed expectations in the playoffs. Speaking of outperforming expectations, Jordi Fernandez singlehandedly ruined Brooklyn's very overt tanking plans. He was so good in his debut campaign that the Nets had to trade Dennis Schröder on literally the first day Golden State could make the salaries work just to weaken the roster. His absence in Sacramento was acutely felt last season, and while De'Aaron Fox likely forces his way out either way, the bad vibes were hard to miss in the context of the widespread praise Fernandez has earned from players basically everywhere he's been. Redick is the most interesting case of the three. You can point to the most overt negatives here, such as his questionable decision not to use his bench in the second half of Game 4 against Minnesota. His response to that decision in his pregame press conference in Game 5 raised eyebrows as well. Redick's temperament was a frequent talking point in his debut season. He doesn't exactly project calm and composure. But that's something that should come with time and experience. The things he did bring to the Lakers as a rookie, with no assistant experience, were far rarer. Tactically speaking, Redick was mostly brilliant in his debut campaign. He designed an aggressive, switching defense that thrived without Anthony Davis , and he was able to tailor game plans to specific opponents far more than most head coaches do in the regular season. He drew widespread praise for the ball-denial approach he deployed against Nikola Jokić, for instance. The offense was far more structured than it was under Darvin Ham, and even with the introduction of Dončić, the Lakers still improved from 25th to 9th in passes per game and from 28th to 14th in 3-point attempt rate. Redick made rookie mistakes in the playoffs. He's far from the first coach to do so. But he's about all of the right things from a strategic perspective and is well on his way to becoming a very good NBA head coach. 12. Nick Nurse, 76ers We're going to address last year's rankings a few times as we get to the top of this list, and that starts with Nick Nurse, who I placed No. 2. If you want to argue that he's the second-best coach in the NBA , the evidence exists. He's exceedingly creative strategically, and the 2019 Finals, in which he threw box-and-one and triangle-and-two defenses at Stephen Curry , were a perfect showcase for that. He has at several points vastly exceeded expectations from a roster perspective, such as the 2020 follow-up in which the Raptors were the No. 2 seed despite losing Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, or the 2021-22 season in which he led a Raptors team fresh off the No. 4 pick to 48 wins. Before Joel Embiid got hurt in January of 2024, he was undeniably playing the best basketball of his career, including his MVP season. Nurse's revamped offense deserves some credit for that. He also seemingly lost the locker room at the end in Toronto, and even as Philadelphia tanked last season, it would be hard to ignore the lifelessness of the entire 76ers season. The defensive effort was notably poor at times. The offense so often boiled down to \"well, whose turn is to dribble?\" You can argue Nurse is an elite coach. You can also argue, based on those negatives, that he was great early on and has since faded meaningfully. Let's see how this year goes. 11. Will Hardy, Jazz 10. Kenny Atkinson, Cavaliers 9. Quin Snyder, Hawks 8. Chris Finch, Timberwolves Will Hardy has won less than 35% of his NBA games, but just got extended through 2031. That doesn't happen to most coaches in his shoes. It happened for Hardy because the Jazz have been actively tying his hands behind his back. They won 68 games in his first two seasons when their goal was likely to win between 30 and 40 in total. He so overperformed that Danny Ainge had to kneecap his roster in February by trading away a bunch of veterans. It took the Jazz two years to build a roster bad enough that even Hardy couldn't make it competitive. It will therefore be a few years before we'll see what he can do with a good roster, but he's done so much with so little that it would be foolish to deny him his place in the top half of this list just because of the teams he's had. We knew Mark Daigneault was good before the Thunder were. This is the same thing. Sometimes, coaching success comes down to luck. If Hardy hadn't taken the Utah job, he almost certainly would have replaced Ime Udoka in Boston instead of Joe Mazzulla and would probably have a championship by now. He's not a bad coach because he got hired by a bad team. He's a great coach waiting for his team to catch up to him. In three years with the Jazz, he's managed a .500 record with his most-used starting lineups in each season (28-28). Don't blame him for rarely actually being allowed to use your best lineups. Kenny Atkinson and Quin Snyder are very appropriately neck-and-neck. They're both branches off of the Mike Budenholzer coaching tree. They both almost always overperform their regular-season expectations, and each has a No. 1 seed to their name. Their offenses follow defined and sensible structures. Snyder tends to build spread pick-and-roll offenses around a high-end ball-handler or two, but allow for wings to create out of the advantages their guards generate. Atkinson runs plenty of pick-and-roll as well, but in Cleveland last year he ensured that the system was extremely egalitarian. The ball movement was limited, but lethal. The Cavaliers let one of their many ball-handlers generate an advantage and then pass into a wide-open 3, which almost always fell. Defensively, both favor drop coverage, but now have far more flexible personnel than they did at earlier stops in their careers. Both are highly-regarded player developers. Snyder gets the slim edge because he has more experience, but you can't go wrong either way. Has Chris Finch ever had a normal season or team? He took over the Timberwolves in the middle of the 2020-21 campaign, drawing plenty of criticism as he bypassed potential interim candidates in Minnesota. He's been at the helm for four full seasons, and in three of them he's had fairly distinct rosters: the deeper Anthony Edwards-Karl-Anthony Towns group of the 2021-22 season, the Rudy Gobert jumbo team of the two seasons after, and then, last season, he was forced to redesign everything right before camp when the Timberwolves traded Towns for Julius Randle . It's never traditional, and that has never mattered. Finch keeps figuring out how to make the most of bizarre circumstances. He coaxed two great playoff rounds out of Randle after the Knicks never even got one. He figured out how to make a two-big offenses work with several different flavors of center. Minnesota's stellar defense with Gobert has drawn justifiable praise, but remember, Finch's 2022 team ranked 13th in defense with Towns at center and defending largely on the perimeter in an ultra-aggressive scheme that looked nothing like the Gobert teams. If you were to distill all of the strategic elements of coaching into a single term, it would be problem-solving. How do you overcome the challenges the league presents with the tools your general manager provides, knowing that most of the time, those tools are going to be imperfect and ill-suited for certain opponents? Part of the reason the Timberwolves feel so comfortable frequently swapping Finch's tools around and giving him bizarre fits is that they trust him to figure out how to make the most of them. 7. Joe Mazzulla, Celtics 6. Mark Daigneault, Thunder 5. Ime Udoka, Rockets 4. Steve Kerr, Warriors 3. Ty Lue, Clippers 2. Erik Spoelstra, Heat Our last two championship coaches are, by far, the most interesting names on this list. Last year, I ranked Joe Mazzulla 11th. Celtics fans were predictably upset. My logic at the time was, essentially, that evaluating him, given the remarkably gifted roster he was coaching, was almost impossible. Think about the problem-solving we discussed with Chris Finch. It's hard to judge a coach's problem-solving when their roster is so good that they'll rarely have problems. To an extent, Mark Daigneault dealt with similar circumstances last spring. His roster was so much better than the ones he was coaching against that evaluating him so early into his playoff career was pretty difficult. The sample, in both cases, remains small. Based on the visible components of coaching, Mazzulla and Daigneault had rocky 2025 postseasons. Mazzulla refused to back off from his \"fire a billion 3s\" approach to offense, even with enormous leads against the Knicks, which created enough variance for New York to come back and win games it really should've lost. He couldn't solve Mitchell Robinson or New York's switching on defense. He stuck with the compromised Kristaps Porziņģis for far too long. We don't know how that series would have played out if Jayson Tatum had remained healthy. However, you could argue that Mazzulla was the reason the Celtics fell down 3-1 in the series. Yes, Boston suffered unsustainably poor shooting variance... but it hurt them as much as it did because Mazzulla drilled high-risk shot-selection into their heads all season. When faced with more significant problems than he had to deal with in 2024, he couldn't solve them. Daigneault won the championship last season, but there were some pretty visible foibles along the way. He completely bungled the \"foul up three\" strategy in Game 1 against the Nuggets, leading to a stunning loss. He struggled to crack David Adelman's zone defense, allowing Denver to come within one game of stealing a series it had no business winning. Yes, Indiana stunned everyone this past postseason, but the Game 1 collapse and Game 6 no-show were jarring. Why did he change his starting lineup before the Finals began? That was an own-goal. What sort of conversations would we be having about the Thunder and Daigneault if Tyrese Haliburton hadn't torn his Achilles? Like Mazzulla in 2025, Daigneault's playoff run was filled with question marks. Like Mazzulla in 2024, his roster gave him a big enough talent buffer over the competition that he overcame them. We shouldn't ignore what happened last spring, but we shouldn't pretend that they represent definitional flaws for very good coaches either. Everything we've covered in this space represents the visible, but as we addressed early on, the things we see so directly are only a small part of what really comprises coaching. It is obvious, based on watching their teams for full seasons, that Mazzulla and Daigneault excel in the less visible components of coaching. They have developed systems and structures that should allow for sustainable winning so long as the rosters are equipped to do so. Mazzulla probably needs to be a bit more flexible with his shot-selection, but the system he's installed has done far more good for Boston than harm. Daigneault has built an all-time defense and a locker room culture that seems as sturdy as any we've had in the NBA for some time. These are great coaches. They are also relatively early in their coaching journeys, and therefore more prone to mistakes that more experienced counterparts might be able to avoid. If you're good enough to win championships through your growing pains, well, odds are you're heading somewhere pretty special. There is a chance these are one day the two best coaches in the NBA. With hindsight, I would've ranked Mazzulla higher last season. I think what happened last spring was also reasonable proof that Mazzulla still has room to grow as a coach. The lesson, generally, is that we shouldn't anoint coaches too early. So naturally, that means we're about to cover a coach who, with the playoffs factored in, has actually coached even fewer games than Mazzulla and Daigneault. Ime Udoka is the only one of the three not to have won a championship yet, but he has made the Finals, and he's never had the same overwhelming roster advantage that they had in their championship runs. Here's a fun fact: all three teams Udoka has coached have improved by double-digit wins, even if you adjust Boston's 2020-21 win total to reflect the shortened season. He's simultaneously remarkably inventive and fairly old-school. How many modern coaches would have considered trying the Alperen Sengun-Steven Adams duo? Udoka turned it into Houston's secret weapon. Turning Robert Williams III into an off-ball rover defensively turned a .500 Celtics team into a juggernaut that came two wins short of the title. He's an underrated offensive coach as well. His lone Celtics team was the best after-timeout offense in basketball, and last year's Rockets ranked ninth. His offenses could stand to shoot more 3s, but that's a personnel issue more than a coaching one, as it wasn't a problem in Boston. In two brief stints with two different teams, Udoka has developed cultures of accountability and effort that have turned both of his groups into winners. He is the NBA's best current coach without a championship ring. What separates the first three coaches in this tier from the next three is longevity. Our final four coaches have each won titles and reached the Finals multiple times, combining for eight rings and 16 conference titles among them. Mazzulla, Daigneault and Udoka are elite, but Mazzulla and Daigneault have largely worked around a single basic roster construct, while Udoka obviously does not have a title yet. These coaches have all built long-term winners around several different iterations of their rosters, even if only one of them has coached multiple teams. Steve Kerr is about as divisive as Hall of Fame coaches get. Even his own fans wish he'd simplify things and just run more pick-and-roll a lot of the time. Just remember that before he took over, Mark Jackson somehow led an offense with Stephen Curry that somehow ranked 30th in the NBA in passes per game. The overwhelming majority of NBA coaches would have taken one look at Curry and slapped together the obvious, heliocentric offense that 90% of star guards run. Kerr devised a scheme that not only maximized an all-time great player but kept everyone on the roster just as engaged. When he stumbled into a similarly gifted defender in Draymond Green , he again leaned into the specific gifts of his star and reimagined Golden State's defense around switching and versatility. You can perhaps argue with his recent player-development track record. So much for the two timelines, eh? But just think about how many coaches get fired every year because their offense is too vanilla or their supporting players are too uninvolved. Those teams all wish that Steve Kerr were their head coach. Ty Lue still hasn't had a single, start-to-finish healthy season coaching the Clippers. Perhaps if he had, he'd have a second ring by now. It's hard to argue with a coach who managed to reach Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals without his best player back in 2021. Last year, the Clippers went 24-21 without Kawhi Leonard on the floor. The Clippers let Paul George walk for nothing in part because they knew Lue could take the depth his absence would provide and turn it into a cohesive team. They were right. The Clippers ranked No. 3 in the NBA in defense last season despite not having an All-Defensive selection. They rank near the top of the league in offense after timeouts basically every year because Lue is one of the best play-designers in basketball. He's a renowned playoff adjuster, even if it sometimes takes him a bit too long to make the changes that so often alter series. And if LeBron James respects you enough to let you tell him to \"shut the f--- up,\" you're probably pretty well-liked by your players. The Clippers once again enter the season with serious uncertainty, but they have a coach that's more than capable of guiding them through it. Erik Spoelstra has been the consensus best coach in the NBA for years now. When we started these rankings a season ago, I never for a moment believed he'd fall off his perch in future installments. The resume speaks for itself. Six Finals trips in the past 15 years. A seemingly endless supply of second-round picks and undrafted free agents developing into legitimate NBA players under his watch. An offense that, for years, balanced the talent of his stars with the need to keep the whole roster engaged. A defense that almost always overperformed. A culture so renowned that they put it on the jerseys. There's no such thing as a perfect coach, but if you let every fanbase pick one to lead their team, for the past half-decade or so, the universal answer would have been Spoelstra. It still could be. Miami's roster has been a mess lately. But last year was probably the first true disappointment a Spoelstra team has experienced since the 2011 Finals. He's far from the only person in Miami culpable for the embarrassing Jimmy Butler saga, but it's ultimately the coach's job to keep locker room peace. From Feb. 1 on, only the Hornets were worse in fourth quarters as the Heat posted a staggeringly poor -12 net rating in final frames. Miami's conditioning and strategic brilliance have historically made them a great end-of-game team. Last year, they choked away game after game after game in the second half. The offense got stale. Was that the result of Butler's absence, or have the Heat gotten a bit complacent? There were even small game-management mistakes that you never used to see in Miami. Spoelstra cost the Heat a game against the Pistons by pulling a Chris Webber and calling a timeout he didn't have. If your team hired Erik Spoelstra tomorrow, you'd still feel great about it. He's just not quite as bulletproof as he has been in years past. By his lofty standards, he just had a down year. Meanwhile, our No. 1 coach is coming off one of the best years of his career. 1. Rick Carlisle, Pacers One of the many little delights of Indiana's surprising run to the NBA Finals last season was that it forced a critical reappraisal of Rick Carlisle's coaching career. The ugly end of his time in Dallas obscured just how much he was really doing to hold together a crumbling organization. He faced plenty of criticism for failing to win a playoff series in his last decade with the Mavericks, but it makes a lot more sense when you actually look at the series he was coaching in. His No. 8-seeded Mavericks pushed the 2014 Spurs to seven games. Neither LeBron James and the Heat (five) nor Kevin Durant and the Thunder (six) did the same. The Kawhi Leonard-Paul George Clippers may be something of a joke now, but he pushed them to the brink twice as massive underdogs. Watching him come one injury short of a championship as a No. 4 seed last season reframed all of those losses to the broader basketball-viewing public. Those weren't disappointments. They were part of a career-long trend of Carlisle teams outperforming expectations in the playoffs, examples of him dragging teams far closer to victory than they had any right of getting. Even the 2011 championship team in Dallas did that. They didn't have home-court advantage in the last three rounds! We covered Billy Donovan as an example of a coach who tailors his playing style to his roster, and Carlisle is the pinnacle of that virtue in all of basketball. At the time, the 2019-20 Mavericks were the most efficient offense in NBA history and they were built largely around Dončić slowly dribbling. In Indiana, he's built a similarly dominant group around Tyrese Haliburton 's selflessness and pace. The 2023-24 Pacers were extremely limited on defense, so he shrugged, conceded the rim entirely, and survived by allowing the fewest 3-pointers in the NBA by far. It took him a while to get here, as he was famously hesitant to cede play-calling duties to Jason Kidd, but with time, he's become a chameleon, able to adapt to whatever players he has. You won't find a more creative play-designer in basketball. His full-court football style plays have become a nerd favorite. He's willing to find uses for anyone, no matter how deep they are on his bench. Tony Bradley played only 14 regular-season games for the Pacers last season, but Carlisle rediscovered him in the Eastern Conference finals and used him to help swing some precarious bench minutes. In that seven-game loss to the Clippers in 2021, he used Boban Marjanović for more total minutes than he'd played in April and May combined in the regular season because the small-ball Clippers presented a matchup advantage. Carlisle benches are almost universally good, whether their talent suggests that they should be or not. His player development track record speaks for itself. He was Jalen Brunson 's first NBA coach. Look at Aaron Nesmith before and after Carlisle got his hands on him. Andrew Nembhard was a second-round pick. We could go on and on and on. The job of a coach is fundamentally to make the most of the players that he has. While Carlisle has had some great ones over the years, he's never been blessed with the sort of obvious juggernauts that his more famous counterparts like Pat Riley or Phil Jackson had. That's probably why he's rarely been a part of the discussion when it comes to the greatest coaches in NBA history. But after what we just witnessed, we really can't deny him his place in that group anymore. All Carlisle has done for the past two-and-a-half decades is exceed expectations. His teams win more than they should. His players grow beyond who we thought they could be. If there was any doubt, last spring punched Carlisle's ticket to the Hall of Fame, and it assured him the top spot among the league's current crop of coaches. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kudos to Dyson Daniels on breaking one of my least favorite streaks in the NBA . Last season, he won Most Improved Player without making the All-Star team. The last player to do so was Pascal Siakam , and he and CJ McCollum are the only active players to win the award without also having made the All-Star Game for the first time in that season. With Ivica Zubac finishing second, the only first-time All-Star to even finish in the top five was Cade Cunningham in third place. Could Daniels represent a change in how the electorate perceives this award? That will take years to play out. What we can note for now is that we had six first-time All-Stars last year along with three second-time All-Stars and three third-time selections. In other words, many of the young players who had been blocked out by older stars in the past have already broken through. There certainly could be a new crop of first-timers this season, but there are fewer logical candidates for that than usual. So without the first-time All-Star marker as our north star, what are we looking for in a Most Improved Player? Timing is the starting point. Seven of the last 15 awards have gone to third-year players, and four of the remaining eight have gone to fourth-year players. No second-year player has won the award since Monta Ellis in 2007. We're therefore looking for players at the end of their rookie deals, and as 17 of the past 18 winners have been first-round picks, we're looking primarily at a 60-player group: the first rounds of the 2022 and 2023 NBA Drafts. Even within those groups, we can trim the fat further. Knock out three players for already having made All-Star teams ( Paolo Banchero , Jalen Williams and Victor Wembanyama ), 10 more for not having full-time roster spots ( Johnny Davis , AJ Griffin , David Roddy , Marjon Beauchamp , Wendell Moore, Patrick Baldwin, TyTy Washington, Jalen Hood-Schifino , Olivier-Maxence Prosper and Nick Smith) and we're already down to 47 before even considering team circumstances and individual performance through two years. The majority of candidates we will seriously consider will come out of that pool of players. But for the moment, we'll keep the field open. Below, we'll break down the odds for Most Improved Player into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +2000 or shorter), the middle of the pack (odds between +2000 and +4000) and the long shots (+4000 and beyond) to try to figure out where the best betting value lies in this always contentious market.

Claim your offer now : There are only four players in this tier. For reasons we'll explain shortly, we're going to hold off on covering one. There is another I'm less interested in: Andrew Nembhard (+1200). There is another Pacer that offers more value down the line. The difference between Nembhard's regular-season 3-point shooting (33.5%) and playoff 3-point shooting (47.3%) has thrown people off of his night-to-night value a bit. Unless you believe he's going to shoot like he does in the playoffs, he's just not going to score enough to realistically factor into this race. So that leaves with two candidates I do like, and they happen to be brothers: Amen Thompson is the favorite at +900, while Ausar Thompson isn't far behind at +2000. The logic for Amen is obvious. With Fred VanVleet out, the ball is going to be in his hands far more than it was a year ago, and with Kevin Durant in place and Reed Sheppard likely to get more minutes, Houston should have more space to operate with offensively. That's a formula for Thompson to get to the basket quite a bit and rack up both points and assists, which in turn is a formula for a first-time All-Star selection if the Rockets are as good as we expect them to be. If that's how this plays out, he's an obvious candidate. As for Ausar, we're cheating a little bit. We saw Amen break out in his second season, but Ausar missed the beginning of his sophomore campaign because of a blood clot. He worked his way into a starting role midseason, but the theory here is that he's due for a breakout similar to his brother's with his role now assured and a full training camp to get ready. He won't have the ball as much as Amen, but the bar here is lower as he isn't starting with the same expectations. Ausar was terrific down the stretch last season and should be able to build on that success now. We mentioned a player in the first category that we were skipping over. That would be Deni Avdija (+1700). We did so because there are two other Blazers with reasonably short odds that also needed to be covered, so we're going to lump them together. Shaedon Sharpe is at +3000, while Scoot Henderson is at +4000. The theory here is that Portland's defense is going to be good enough to make the Blazers at least a play-in-caliber team. Therefore, if one of these players breaks out on offense, they could compete for a true playoff spot. Avdija having the shortest odds doesn't make much sense to me. For starters, his breakout has sort of already happened. He was terrific down the stretch, and when his shot is falling, he's a very good offensive player. But he's much more of a secondary creator than a primary offensive option. Portland's long-term hopes hinge on the more athletic and higher upside Henderson and/or Sharpe taking a major leap. I think both could be good bets, but in different ways. If you want to bet one now, bet Sharpe. He has reportedly been a training camp standout. Henderson is recovering from a hamstring injury and will miss the beginning of the season. You'll get much better odds if you wait until his odds drop ahead of his return. Someone is going to become the early favorite here, and Henderson, without playing, will become a long shot. As for the rest of this group, I'm immediately ruling out Matas Buzelis (+2000) and Reed Sheppard (+2200) for being second-year players. Josh Giddey (+3000) and Payton Pritchard (+3500) are both a bit more interesting for reasons that extend beyond their ages. Both are going to have the ball more than ever this season. Giddey averaged 20 points, 8.5 assists and 9.9 rebounds after the Zach LaVine trade last year. If he does that over the full season while shooting anywhere close to the 45.3% he nailed from 3-point range in that stretch, he's going to finish near the top of the ballot. Even if the 3-point shooting predictably dips, he can make up for it with more volume. The same is true for Pritchard, who is playing without Jayson Tatum , Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis ahead of him in the pecking order. Do I expect him to post All-Star-caliber stats in a role with unlimited freedom? Probably not. But the value here isn't crazy. Outside of Sharpe and perhaps Giddey, my favorite player in this tier is Bennedict Mathurin (+2500). Mathurin has always been an odd fit in Indiana's free-flowing system. He wants the ball in his hands and to operate like a more traditional star scorer. We saw the volatility of that style in the playoffs, when he seemingly was either great or invisible with no in-between. Well, now that Tyrese Haliburton is out, Indiana badly needs someone to take on a high-volume scoring role. Mathurin, in a contract role, will eagerly oblige. The final two players in this range are Michael Porter Jr . and Jonathan Kuminga , both at +4000. I'm out on both. Kuminga may be great when he's inevitably traded, but he won't get enough minutes before that to realistically factor into this race. The theory for Porter is that, on a normal bad team with the ball more than he had it in Denver, he could break out as the high-usage scorer he was meant to be as a prospect. Frankly, nothing that happened in Denver suggests he's a capable enough ball-handler to be a 25-point scorer consistently. That's the bar, and I can't see him reaching it. We're going to split the long shots into two groups. The first are plausible first-time All-Stars. The second is players due for massive role increases after having toiled in obscurity. For the first group, we have four names: Trey Murphy (+5000), Jalen Johnson (+6000), Coby White (+6000) and, I can't believe I'm saying this, Deandre Ayton (+20000). Let's get the obvious out of the way: I don't remotely suspect Ayton to actually be an All-Star. I'm just playing the narrative game on incredibly long odds. If the Lakers are awesome and he looks more like he did in Phoenix, there will be a groundswell of support behind him similar to the one Julius Randle received when he won in 2021. The model here is basically Ayton being a model citizen, playing great defense, setting screens, getting to the line more and benefitting from the great playmaking he'll have in Los Angeles. I don't think he'll ultimately compete for this award, but I can't ignore the chance at 200-to-1. The other three are much more plausible. White posted All-Star scoring numbers in the second half of last season. Johnson would have been an All-Star last year if he hadn't gotten hurt. But Murphy is my favorite player in that group as he can scale up if Zion Williamson gets hurt or play well off of him if he doesn't. He flashed star upside last season when injuries made him the primary option for a stretch, and he's a nerd favorite, so if he plays like he did at his best last year, there is already baked in support. And then there are the the less obvious breakout candidates. Here, we have three names: Jay Huff (+5000), Neemias Queta (+6000) and Jarace Walker (+15000). We obviously have two Pacer front court players here. One is a former No. 8 overall pick whose been buried on the depth chart but looked good in small doses. The other is a per-minute darling with the skill set best suited to replace the bulk of Myles Turner 's role. Either are solid choices. Queta, simply by virtue of jumping from a bit player to a possible starter on a high-profile team, is going to get some buzz early in the season if he plays well. He's not Boston's traditional center archetype as a rim-runner rather than a shooter, but the Celtics have so much shooting still in place that he should be able to benefit from plenty of easy buckets. And there's one unusual candidate that I want to mention. In our MVP odds preview, I mentioned Alperen Sengun as a 300-to-1 long shot I liked. For the same reasons, I want his MIP odds at +10000. One of Houston's young players is about to take a big leap just by virtue of the extra touches available without Fred VanVleet. We covered Amen Thompson already. Well, if you're a Thompson bettor, you basically have to hedge Sengun as well in case he's the one who shines in VanVleet's absence. Sengun was one of the best players at EuroBasket, drawing notable comparisons to Nikola Jokić. It's not likely as he's already made an All-Star Game, but there's a world in which he takes a very significant, All-NBA leap, and there are voters who tend to reward that sort of leap. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers used his Monday pregame press conference to express his frustrations with the mass arrests being conducted by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago. The Bucks were preparing to play the Bulls in Chicago Sunday night, and as a Chicago native, Rivers felt compelled to speak about the matter. \" It bothers me ,\" Rivers said. \"I'm trying, I'm trying. I mean, it's just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that's not this country. That's not what we're about.\" ICE has been conducting mass arrests across Chicago since early September in a large-scale deportation effort at the direction of President Donald Trump, though a federal judge ruled recently to extend a consent decree that limits ICE's ability to arrest people without warrants or probable cause. Meanwhile, the Defense Department is attempting to send 200 National Guard soldiers from Texas, and another 300 from Illinois, into Chicago to aid ICE across the city. For the time being, the National Guard has been temporarily blocked from deploying in Chicago after the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling from U.S. District Judge April Perry to deny the deployment of the troops, though they temporarily remain under federal control. \"I think [Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson] has done an amazing job with everything he says,\" River said. \"You know, I think this is starting to separate us all, which I hate. This is not, you can be pro-civil rights or what's right and not be, like, anti-white. And I think that's what it's starting to become in some ways. And it shouldn't be. It really shouldn't be. I would hope that if this was Ukrainian immigrants being detained that everyone on both races would fight for it. That's wrong. It's just wrong.\" Rivers continued, \"I think every American is good with if there's criminals on the street, we want to arrest the criminals. My dad [Grady] was a [Maywood] cop for Christ's sakes. My dad would not be proud of this. I know that. My dad would have a major problem. I couldn't imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they're doing. I couldn't imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he'd call in sick. And it's just so – did you walk around the city today? This is an amazing city.\" ICE has been conducting targeted arrests in many neighborhoods across Chicago, primarily in areas with higher numbers of people of color. Protestors have been active outside the ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, where they've clashed with ICE agents, the National Guard and police officers. \"Riding down the elevator with a couple -- I wish I could remember where they're from -- their daughter ran in the marathon and the couple was so proud and they were saying, 'Man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I've never been to this city, wow,'\" Rivers said. \"And the dad says, 'But we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere.' And he was like, 'Where is it?' It's nowhere. It's just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I'm from Chicago. I'm very prideful about this place, so I hate it.\" © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The biggest story in Milwaukee -- and one of the biggest in the NBA -- this offseason has been the \"will he, won't he\" drama surrounding a potential Giannis Antetokounmpo trade request. After another disappointing playoff exit, Antetokounmpo genuinely considered asking out of Milwaukee for the first time in his career, but chose to stick it out for one more season with the Bucks to see if the roster changes can get him closer to competing for another title. The first concrete sign that Giannis was coming back for the 2025-26 season was the Bucks agreeing to a new one-year deal with his brother Thanasis. They went a step further Monday by adding a third Antetokounmpo, signing Alex to a two-way contract, as relayed to Shams Charania by his agent. It's the first time in NBA history that three brothers will all be on the same roster. Thanasis has long been paired with Giannis on the Bucks' roster, and they now are joined by Alex, who spent 2022-24 with their G League affiliate, the Wisconsin Herd. It's a not so subtle effort from the Bucks to make Giannis as comfortable and happy as possible in Milwaukee, as family is extremely important to the Greek star and he'll now have two of his brothers with him for most of the season. Alex will still spend time in the G League, but can be active on the Bucks' main roster for 50 games this season. The lone basketball playing Antetokounmpo brother that is not on the Milwaukee roster right now is Kostas, who last played in the NBA with the Lakers back in the 2020-21 season. Time will tell if Milwaukee's plan of signing as many available Antetokounmpo's pays off in the form of Giannis staying long-term, but they cannot be faulted for trying. That said, Giannis made it clear the most important thing is an opportunity to win a title. If the Bucks make another early playoff exit in 2026, it may not matter how many Antetokounmpos the Bucks sign, the star may re-evaluate his situation next summer and look for a new home. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Jonathan Kuminga didn’t make it to the second half of Tuesday night’s preseason game. The Golden State forward was thrown out of a 118-111 Warriors victory over the Portland Trail Blazers in the final moments of the second quarter after he made contact with an official while arguing for a call. That led to an immediate technical foul and ejection. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Kuminga was driving to the rim at the Moda Center trying to get a bucket to fall before the buzzer, though he missed the layup after thinking that he drew contact in the middle of the lane. As play went the other way to wrap up the quarter, Kuminga got into the official's face and made contact with him — which will lead to an ejection every time. Kuminga had 7 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists in 18 minutes when he left. Tuesday’s outing was Kuminga’s third this preseason, and came just weeks after he landed a new two-year, $48.5 million deal to return to the franchise after months of uncertainty. Kuminga and the Warriors had been in a contract dispute throughout the offseason that frequently felt like it was going nowhere. The new deal now means that Kuminga will be eligible to be traded in January, which is something that is reportedly likely to be explored at a minimum. Kuminga, who the Warriors took with the No. 7 overall pick in 2021, averaged 15.3 points and 4.6 rebounds while shooting 30.5% from behind the arc last season. The 23-year-old missed significant time last season due to an ankle injury he went down with in January, but he returned in time for the postseason. The Trail Blazers took a five-point lead into the locker room at halftime, but the Warriors surged ahead in the fourth quarter to grab the seven-point win. Stephen Curry dropped 28 points while shooting 4-of-11 from the 3-point line, and Quinten Post added 16 points off the bench. All five of the Trail Blazers' starters hit double figures in the loss. Shaedon Sharpe led the way with 18 points after he shot 7-of-16 from the field. Donovan Clingan added 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Deni Avdija finished with 15 points. The Warriors have one game left, Friday night against the Los Angeles Clippers, in their preseason slate. They will open the regular season on Oct. 21 against the Los Angeles Lakers."}

An organization looking to make this type of hire needs to look at the process differently. “It’s not just hiring the first female coach,” Staley said. “Because one, if I’m the Knicks coach and you have a five-game losing streak, it’s not going to be about the losing streak.

Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Here are three takeaways from a Warriors win that moves them to 3-1 in the preseason. Rest, injuries, and the desire to experiment have led coach Steve Kerr to use a different starting lineup in each of the Warriors’ first four preseason games. The biggest change Tuesday night in Portland was the addition of the Warriors’ rookie second-round draft pick. “I feel like it’s a good night to have Will out there for ball handling, decision making and it’s a good night for him to have to guard different guys and play against a really athletic team,” Kerr told reporters in his pregame press conference. “It’ll give us a good look at him, and it gives him a chance to play with Steph and BP and Al and JK. It’ll be a good challenge for him, but a good opportunity too.” The Warriors’ first two points of the game that weren’t from three Curry free throws came from a cutting Richard. Kuminga was backing down his defender when Richard darted into the paint and caught a pass for two points. JK dishes to Richard for the easy layup 🤝 pic.twitter.com/SmZioAYrBn Richard’s first made outside jumper was with a little more than three minutes remaining in the second quarter. Standing wide-open on the left wing as Curry got into the paint, Richard didn’t hesitate when hit in the chest with a pass from the defense collapsing. Swish. Defense is Richard’s first trait, but that kind of confidence offensively will help him find minutes as a rookie. He was easily the Warriors’ second-best player in the first half behind Curry, going into halftime with eight points, made both of his threes and was a plus-10, which tied him with Curry as the team leader. Richard then, in the second half, scored another five points and had four more rebounds. In the final seconds of the first half, Kuminga was on the wrong end of the rare one-tech ejection. Kuminga went through contact for a layup down the middle of the paint and missed hard off the glass. As he crashed into the stanchion, Kuminga threw his hands up in frustration, looking for a foul call. Though it wasn’t shown on the broadcast, Blazers commentators claimed Kuminga made contact with a referee’s face as he argued the no-call. Kuminga then immediately was ejected in a bizarre scene. He might have been playing his best half of the preseason, too. Kuminga played 18 minutes and stuffed the stat sheet. He scored seven points on 3-of-5 shooting and made his only free throw, and also had six rebounds and four assists, both of which were team highs at the time. His impact was even better than his stats. Throughout the preseason, Kuminga consistently has been setting up his teammates for easy looks. That trend continued Tuesday night, even when they didn’t convert. Kuminga now has four or more assists in three of the Warriors’ four preseason games. JK dishes to Richard for the easy layup 🤝 pic.twitter.com/SmZioAYrBn Last season, Kuminga only registered four or more assists in eight games. After Deni Avdija made a three at the 8:19 mark of the third quarter to give the Blazers a 10-point lead, neither team scored until Curry went to the free-throw line with 6:56 left in the quarter. He split his free throws, but that was the start to a 13-0 run by the Warriors. Curry scored five points in that span, putting the Warriors up by three points. The Blazers and Warriors then traded four straight threes, with the fourth being a 27-footer from Curry that again gave his team a three-point lead. About a minute and a half later, his night was over but Curry had already made a statement. Curry’s 28 points in 26 minutes led both teams. The demon from long distance made three 3-pointers all within inches of each other on the right wing, and another from the left corner. His six rebounds were a team high when he took a seat, as were Curry’s five assists. How Curry continuously went to the free-throw line stood out most. Curry only once attempted 13 or more free throws last season. He was 12 of 13 in three quarters Tuesday night.

On Saturday, the injured Indiana Pacers star sat on his team's bench during a preseason game against the Oklahoma City Thunder wearing a Chicago Cubs jersey. It just so happened that the Cubs were playing the Brewers that day in Game 5 of their National League Division Series. Two days later, Haliburton arrived at the Pacers' preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs rocking a Dodgers jersey (reportedly that of L.A. superstar Shohei Ohtani ).

The reason, it seems, is because of an alleged snub that took place in the summer of 2024. During an appearance on \" The Pat McAfee Show \" in April, Haliburton said he had been scheduled to throw out a ceremonial first pitch before a Brewers game last summer ... until he and the Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks during the first round of the 2024 NBA playoffs. \"I was a Brewers fan,\" he said, \"and then I was supposed to throw the first pitch last summer, and they X'ed that after the playoff series. So I said, 'You know what? I'm no longer a Brewers fan.'\" After that, Haliburton said, he became a \"free agent\" as a baseball fan. Haliburton must have been thrilled with the result of Game 1 of the NLCS, a 2-1 Dodgers win, but he might want to track down jerseys for the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays just in case — the Brewers are still just four wins away from facing one of those teams in the World Series.

The Dallas Mavericks have signed head coach Jason Kidd to a multi-year contract extension. The Mavericks announced the extension on Tuesday following multiple reports. Terms of the deal were not initially reported. The extension was anticipated after general manager Nico Harrison implied in June that one was coming amid rumors that the Knicks were interested in hiring Kidd. New York instead hired Mike Brown, and Dallas will retain Kidd for the start of a new era of Mavericks basketball. Previously, there was speculation that Kidd would seek an exit from Dallas following the stunning midseason trade last season of All-NBA franchise cornerstone Luka Dončić to the rival Los Angeles Lakers. [ Get more Mavericks news: Dallas team feed ] The Mavericks' fortunes have turned since the roundly criticized deal, and their 2025-26 campaign will start with buzz around rookie Cooper Flagg, whom Dallas drafted with the No. 1 pick after winning the NBA Draft lottery against long odds. Flagg will play with All-NBA forward Anthony Davis — who was acquired in the Dončić trade — and eventually All-NBA guard Kyrie Irving when Irving returns from an ACL tear that he suffered in March. The Mavericks are banking on the trio leading the franchise to championship contention, starting this season. Kidd is a significant part of those plans and will continue to lead the team with its newly formed core. Kidd, 52, is a Hall of Fame player who played point guard for the 2010-11 Mavericks team that secured the franchise's only NBA championship. Since retiring as a player, he's served as the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, Milwaukee Bucks and Mavericks. Kidd joined the Mavericks as head coach in 2021 and coached them to the NBA Finals with Dončić and Irving in 2024. In four seasons, Kidd has coached the Mavericks to a 179-149 (.546) record with two playoff appearances. The Mavericks finished 39-43 and fell out of playoff contention last season in the aftermath of the Dončić deal."}

Watch live shows and highlights 24/7] \"I'm 30 years old, I can play in the NBA until I'm 36-38.

He previously played with Filathlitikos before the Bucks drafted him in 2013. The two-time league MVP led the franchise to a championship in 2021, too.

Antetokounmpo has been the subject of trade rumors in recent years, and again this past offseason after the Bucks were knocked out of the first round of the playoffs once again. There was a report the team engaged in trade talks about him with the New York Knicks , but Giannis shut that down. The Bucks also signed his youngest brother, Alex, to a two-way deal on Monday.

You’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I'm locked in. I’m locked into this team. I’m locked into these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Whether Antetokounmpo plays somewhere else in the NBA still remains to be seen. While it won’t happen anytime soon — Antetokounmpo will turn 31 in December, and still has several solid years left in the league — it sounds like he won’t hesitate to spend a bit of time playing in his home country before hanging it up for good."}

He whipped passes through a sea of outstretched arms. He lobbed up a sky-high alley-oop. He canned a step-back three. Luka Doncic is so back. The star guard had 25 points, seven rebounds and four assists in his preseason debut Tuesday, but the Lakers crumbled in the second half of a 113-104 loss to the Phoenix Suns at Mortgage Matchup Center. Fresh off a quarterfinal finish in EuroBasket, where he led the tournament in scoring for Slovenia, Doncic wowed his teammates by zipping passes through microscopic lanes and chucking up one-legged three-pointers. After Doncic missed a free throw, he saved the rebound blindly over his head and the possession ended in a three-pointer from Nick Smith Jr. Doncic flashed an ear-to-ear grin toward his teammates on the bench. The playmaking was a welcome sight, but coach JJ Redick, who played with Doncic in Dallas, was looking forward to seeing that joyful, childlike energy return after the star guard shook off the emotional toll of last year’s shocking trade. “Just getting out there and playing basketball for me is amazing. I missed it,” Doncic said. “I think you can see that. … I’m just happy to be on the basketball court again.” With Doncic and veteran guard Marcus Smart – who returned after Achilles tendinopathy – back, the Lakers inched one step closer to full strength with the regular season one week away. But they are still far from whole. Not only was LeBron James not on the bench as he is expected to miss the beginning of the season with sciatica, the team ruled guard Gabe Vincent, forwards Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt and center Jaxson Hayes out Tuesday ahead of a back-to-back that will end in Las Vegas against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. Read more: LeBron out, Luka in: Where the Lakers stand one week from opening night Doncic will likely be among the players who now rotate out against the Mavericks, along with guard Austin Reaves, who scored 25 points on eight-for-16 shooting in 31 minutes. The Suns' bench seemingly had more players dressed in street clothes than suited up for the game. Guards Devin Booker, Dillon Brooks, Collin Gillespie and Grayson Allen, forwards Royce O’Neal and Ryan Dunn and center Nick Richards were all out after the Suns returned Monday from two preseason games in China. Guard Jared Butler instead carried the Suns with 35 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. Doncic was on a modified training regimen to begin training camp because of a busy summer with his national team. He led Slovenia to the quarterfinals at EuroBasket and was named to the tournament’s All-Star Five after leading in scoring with 34.7 points per game, 8.6 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game. While ramping up during practice, Doncic was already starting to build chemistry with his new teammates in his first training camp with the Lakers. He said his debut was “probably better than I expected,” but he still had five turnovers, a sign of continued rust. A first-quarter alley oop dunk with center Deandre Ayton showed signs of what could be. “He's truly one-in-a-generational player when it comes to that pick and roll,” Ayton said. “Like it feels like he got eyes on the back of his head.” The 26-year-old Doncic dominated in the first half to help the Lakers to a 10-point halftime lead. But the offense fell apart when he retired to the bench halfway through the third quarter. The defense gave up 67 points in the second and third quarters combined. Guard Jordan Goodwin, who was waived by the Lakers this offseason, led the Suns comeback with 24 points on 10-of-20 shooting with six assists. He even converted a four-point play after Bronny James fouled him on a three-pointer that gave the Suns an 82-80 lead with 2:25 remaining in the third quarter. The Lakers never climbed back in front.

When betting futures, it’s generally not a good idea to pick multiple winners in the same market at the same time. If you choose multiple NBA title winners right now, you are instantly absorbing at least one losing ticket in a higher hold market. Instead, when you are going to bet multiple things in the same futures market, try and time them so you get both options at the best possible price. It’s rare that you will pick off multiple teams simultaneously and they will all be the best price that exists throughout the season. It’s better to play the math game than to trust your gut and instinct to bet multiple teams at once. Furthermore, when betting potential NBA champions try not to bet within the same conference so early. If these teams end up playing in the first round, it’s lost value immediately as one ticket wins, another loses and you may have to start considering hedging too early. So while this article will provide some looks at various teams, choose the one you most agree with, and stick with just that. You can keep others in mind for later in the season, depending on how injuries and other things shake out. Here are a few NBA title futures bets worth considering: (Odds courtesy of BetMGM ) The Thunder are the obvious first choice to win the 2025-26 NBA title and repeat as champions. This team had the luxury of returning all its key components, and because of the team’s youth, it’s fair to expect internal development and growth. Last year, the Thunder ranked second in youngest average age at 24.7 years old, and were the sixth-youngest team in terms of average age weighted by minutes played at 25.1. They also had a few injuries that held them back, notably Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein were hurt on and off during the regular season and rarely got time to jell as a two-big lineup; they played 20 games together during the regular season before 23 in the playoffs. Right after the NBA Finals, we learned All-NBA player Jalen Williams received nearly 30 painkilling injections into his wrist. If this team avoids any catastrophic injuries again this season, +250 will be a strong number heading into the postseason. The flip side is the NBA hasn’t had a repeat champion in seven seasons. The parity in the league is increasing because of the balance of talent, but also play style, the increased pace and 3-point shooting create more variance. I would rather play Oklahoma City on a wait-and-see approach — if it does sustain any injuries, +250 or better will likely be available, and if it has a tough playoff bracket, it should be right around that price. There is asymmetry here in obtaining value that is worth leaving alone right now. On the other opposite end of the age scale are the Clippers. This team is designed to win now based on roster construction, depth, veteran presence, coaching and salary-cap implications. This offseason, Los Angeles brought back home-town hero Chris Paul, signed Brook Lopez, and traded Norman Powell for John Collins simply because it knew Bradley Beal would be coming after taking a buyout from the Phoenix Suns. This team is stacked — and I would not be surprised if it is a team that will continue to try and bolster its roster and do all it can to win a title. Last season the Clippers were considered the second-best team coming into the Western Conference playoffs by many sharp bettors, only to lose in a seven-game, first-round series to Denver, which included an Aaron Gordon offensive rebound and put-back dunk as time expired in Game 1. The reason we are getting 16-1 is because of the current NBA investigation into the Kawhi Leonard and salary-cap circumvention accusations (and some proof without a smoking gun thus far). It’s possible the NBA reaches a midseason ruling on Leonard and gives him a hefty suspension, restricts him from the playoffs or even voids his contract. Figuring out the potential punishment has been difficult because the Clippers don’t own their first-round pick until 2030; so revoking first rounders 4-5 years from now hardly seems like a proper punishment. Suspending Kawhi but not for the playoffs is difficult, because he is the face of load management and taking days off for preventative health reasons. Some insiders I have spoken with think this situation doesn’t get resolved this season, and if that is the case, 16-1 is the best number on the board. Without any drama, this team would undoubtedly be above the Timberwolves (13-1) and probably closer to Denver at +550 than we expect. It was just four years ago the Hawks punched a ticket to the Eastern Conference finals and blew up the “Trust the Process” Philadelphia 76ers. This offseason, after a bolster of win-now moves, they have easily the best chance of getting back there since then. The starting lineup is likely to look like: All-Star Trae Young at PG Reigning Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels Rookie of the Year runner-up Zaccharie Risacher Potential breakout player Jalen Johsnon Versatile center Onyeka Okongwu That is a solid group in a weak Eastern Conference. To go one step further, their two offseason acquisitions are likely to be coming off the bench or spot starting in Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. With those two additions, this team added two of the most valuable traits in the NBA: 3-point shooting and versatile defense. Their competition this year seems to be the New York Knicks, against whom Trae Young has relished playing at Madison Square Garden, and the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are already starting the season behind the 8-ball with injuries to two starters (Darius Garland and Max Strus). At 30-1, this is my favorite mid-to-long-range ticket and favorite Eastern Conference team to hold. Looking for a true long shot? Let me sell you on the Raptors. The NBA is a copycat league and this is the team most trying to mimic the Thunder. From March 1 until the end of last season, the Raptors ranked No. 1 on defense. They are a group that creates a lot of turnovers and turns them into transition opportunities. When they are stuck in the halfcourt on either end, defensively they focus on guarding the 3-point line at an elite level, and offensively they brought in and extended Brandon Ingram for isolation scoring. They have a big in Jakob Poeltl who will play the Hartenstein role of elite screen-setting and passing out of the high post, while providing very good rim protection. [ Check out all of Yahoo's sports betting content here in our new betting hub ] Last season, the Thunder were the NBA’s best team against the spread, but the Raptors were second and covered at over a 59% clip. Coach Darko Rajaković prides himself on the same player development that coach Mark Daigneault does, and the roster youth is similar (fourth-youngest team based on weighted minutes). If there is a team in the East that is going to make a Pacers-like run and bust through some playoff series unexpectedly, it is the Raptors with some hot shooting. The defense will be there, the transition game will be there and the lean into some game-theory optimal strategies are certain, so it becomes about getting a good bracket and having some variance go their way. The Raptors going over their win total is my favorite NBA future this year, as I think this will be a .500 team with a chance of being an outright top-six team and avoid the play-in tournament all together. This number will be good come playoff time, it's just a matter of if it's realistic or it becomes a simple hedge position that doesn’t net that much worth in the long run."}

While her interview was legitimate, Dawn Staley doesn’t think the NBA is actually ready for a woman to be a head coach in the league. The longtime South Carolina head coach actually interviewed for the same opening with the New York Knicks earlier this offseason after the franchise parted with Tom Thibodeau. The Knicks ended up hiring Mike Brown. It’s unclear how far Staley actually got in the process, but she wasn’t considered a finalist for the job . [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Now looking back on the process, she thinks the league as a whole just isn't ready to hire a woman. “No, I don’t [believe it will happen in my lifetime],” Staley said on Tuesday, via ESPN’s Myron Medcalf . “And I hope I’m wrong.” Staley has been at South Carolina since 2008, and she’s quickly turned the program into a women’s basketball powerhouse. She’s led the Gamecocks to nine SEC tournament and regular-season titles, seven Final Four appearances and three NCAA championships — most recently in 2024. They’ve been to the Final Four five straight times, and the national championship game in three of the last four years. Staley is the highest-paid coach in women’s college basketball, too. She signed an extension through the 2029-30 season earlier this year that is worth around $25.5 million . She was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, too. The Gamecocks are ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press’ preseason poll this fall, even though star Chloe Kitts will miss the entire season with a torn ACL . Staley isn’t the first woman to interview for a head coaching job in the NBA. Former San Antonio Spurs assistant Becky Hammon interviewed for jobs several times, and she was a finalist for the Portland Trail Blazers opening in 2021, before she eventually landed with the Las Vegas Aces. But with no woman getting over the mountain just yet, Staley knows the criticism she would have faced in the Knicks role would have been incredibly severe. \"If the Knicks have a five-game losing streak, it's not going to be about the losing streak,\" Staley said. \"It's going to be about being a female coach. So you, as an organization, a franchise, you have to be prepared for and strong enough to ignore those types of instances when you're going to look to hire a female coach.\" Though Staley revealed earlier this year she would have taken the Knicks job were it offered to her, she seems very content at South Carolina.

When the Warriors tip off the 2025-26 NBA season next Tuesday against the Los Angeles Lakers, Curry will become the 10th player in league history to play at least 17 seasons with one team, joining an esteemed list of fellow franchise icons. Stephen Curry is set to become the 10th player ever to play 17 or more seasons with one team.

For Curry, it has been a long but ultimately glorious road. Golden State selected the Davidson guard with the No. 7 overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft in hopes that he could help turn a struggling organization around. Curry, of course, has accomplished much more than that. He turned the Warriors into must-see television while winning two Most Valuable Player awards and delivering four NBA championships to a team that had not won one since 1975. As his 17th season begins, Curry is arguably the most popular figure in Bay Area sports history and is integral to Golden State’s status as the most valuable NBA franchise . Even in an era when team mainstays are largely a thing of the past, perhaps it shouldn’t shock us that Curry and the Warriors have chosen to stick by each other’s side. It doesn’t appear as though that will change anytime soon, either. Curry is signed through an 18th season in 2026-27 and has publicly acknowledged in the past his desire to remain with Golden State for the entirety of his career. Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.

Nobody knows. Antetokounmpo doesn’t know. What he does know is that he wants to play another six to eight NBA seasons, until age 36-38, and then finish his career in his home country of Greece. He said so on ANT1’s The 2night Show, a Tonight Show-style talk show in Greece (hat tip BasketNews.com and Bleacher Report). “I’m 30 years old. I can play in the NBA until I’m 36, 38. I’d like to end my career in a Greek team, why not? I don’t want to live in the United States. As soon as I leave the NBA, I want to return to Greece. I could end my career here, whether this team is called Filathlitikos, Olympiacos, Panathinaikos, or Aris, I’m talking about all the teams now.” Filathlitikos is the team Antetokounmpo played with before coming to the NBA. The other teams he listed are European powerhouses (ones that could be part of whatever the NBA Europe league ends up becoming in a couple of years). We have seen European players head home to finish their careers before — Tony Kukoc from the Jordan-era Bulls, but more recently Serge Ibaka and Evan Fournier, among others — plus big-name NBA players such as Allen Iverson and Dominique Wilkins played there after the NBA. However, none of them were as internationally renowned as Antetokounmpo or would be the draws that he would be back in his home country. This is years away, Antetokounmpo is 30 (he turns 31 in December) and said he would want to play in the NBA until age “36-38.” That’s another contract or two, 5-8 years. Which teams those final NBA contracts will be with will be the focus of a season of speculation coming up. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Some pundits, though, wonder whether the good vibes from one season ago will last 82 games. In an article published Monday , ESPN’s Tim Bontemps ranked every NBA team’s “big three,\" placing Curry, Butler and Green in “Tier 6: Old stars with big questions.\" While Bontemps acknowledged Golden State’s 22-5 record with both Curry and Butler available last season, he cited age as a factor in his uncertainty over their potential success in 2025-26. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “There's little doubt this team has a very high ceiling -- if healthy,” Bontemps wrote. “But given their core is all 35 or older, the ‘if healthy’ question is going to follow this group around all season long.” Bontemps clarifies in the article’s opening that his rankings also take the future value of each team’s core into account, which could explain why a trio of future Hall of Famers placed below other groups of unproven but rising stars. It is no secret that the Warriors enter this upcoming NBA season reliant on veteran star power to win, in a league with seemingly endless young talent. Curry (37), Butler (36) and Green (35) are each a year older, and the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder—whose core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams ranked first in Bontemps' piece—proved how far a youthful, athletic core can take a team. If indeed Golden State’s big three can remain on the court, however, there’s no reason to doubt their championship potential. Curry remains as electric as ever, Green is coming off a third-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting, and Butler showed he still can propel a team to a higher level after the Warriors acquired him in February.

In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Who are the top No. 2 options?", "body": "Manage your account ... Anyone can list the best players in the NBA, but basketball is as much about chemistry as it is talent. Within each of the league's 30 teams is a hierarchy, and how well each of the five players on the court understands and performs his role within that hierarchy is every bit as important as his individual skill. While depth was vital to the success of the Thunder and Pacers last season, and we understand coaches often say, \"It's about who closes the game; not who starts it,\" the pursuit of a roster's most cohesive five-man unit is still paramount. Three of last year's top four starting lineups on our list — the Thunder, Knicks and Timberwolves — reached the conference finals. In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Ideally, a lineup has its superstar, a deferential co-star, a third star who owns his role, a fourth option and a fifth starter to tie it all together — clear Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. How close does your team come to an ideal lineup? What is a No. 2? Here is how we described him last year: He is, generally, the team's second option on offense. He can be an All-Star. In fact, he better be one if you want to compete for a title. Maybe his skill level is a hair below his top teammate. Maybe his skill set is more complementary. Or maybe his personality is more obsequious. Whatever the case, he understands he is not the No. 1, and that is what is most important. Teams do not reach their potential when the No. 2 believes he is the No. 1. All the greats had a Hall of Fame No. 2, and all of them knew where they stood. Bill Russell had Bob Cousy. Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen. Larry Bird had Kevin McHale. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had Oscar Robertson, then Magic Johnson, and then Magic flipped it. Shaquille O'Neal had Kobe Bryant, who then had Pau Gasol. It has a way of sorting itself out. We should add: Defense is a complementary skill! And maybe the most important one among No. 2 options. If a team's No. 1 is ball-dominant, and he almost always is, then his offensive responsibilities often leave slack to be picked up on the defense end. How a co-star supports his leading man is every bit as important as his athleticism or skill. There is a little more dirty work to be done when you are a second option. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] What we have to decide here, then, is how to rank these players, by skill or by how well they complement a team's top dog. Let's call it a combination of the two, inviting even more subjectivity into this exercise. We ranked every co-star. You can debate us on their merits . And we'll have fun doing it. How about that? Lastly, we sourced these lineups and each player's status within them with beat reporters around the league. We appreciate everyone who casted a roster; there are too many people to thank in this space. And we recognize that not every player listed here will be in an opening-night starting lineup. Injuries occur. Coaches change their minds. But just know that this is our best guess at the rotations we will likely see most often from each team. On Monday, we ranked the No. 1 options . Without further ado, your five best No. 2s ... Welcome to our most controversial decision of 2025. Is Williams a better player than LeBron James right now? There is some question about that. James had the superior traditional statistics last season. He averaged a 24-8-8 to Williams' 22-5-5, scoring more efficiently, too. This is probably why James appeared on the All-NBA second team, while Williams cracked the third team. However, Williams surpassed James in several advanced metrics last season, including Daily Plus-Minus : And Estimated Plus-Minus : This is probably because Williams also made the All-Defensive Second Team as someone who can and did defend all five positions. His impact on both ends of the floor was arguably broader. It easily was in the playoffs, where James' Lakers were ousted as third-seeded favorites in five games of a first-round series with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Williams, playing on an injured wrist that required offseason surgery, helped the top-seeded Thunder to the title, even scoring 40 points in a pivotal Game 5 of the NBA Finals. What cannot be argued, really: Williams is the better complementary co-star to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in Oklahoma City than James is to Luka Dončić in Los Angeles. There is overlap in the ball-dominant skill sets of James and Dončić, and neither helps the other on the defensive end. Meanwhile, Williams is exactly who OKC needs him to be. Sometimes more, rarely less. He can and does do a bit of everything. If you need everything from James, he might be able to give it to you on any given night. But if you are asking me: Who is the best No. 2 in basketball right now for the entirety of a season, including playoffs? I think you would be better suited to pick a 24-year-old rising co-star of a championship team over a 40-year-old who will miss the start of the season to sciatica, even if that 40-year-old is LeBron Effing James. What else is left to say about James? He is unquestionably on the Mount Rushmore of NBA legends, along with Jordan, Abdul-Jabbar and Russell. How you want to order them is your business, but nobody has sustained his greatness for as long as James has. Did we mention he is 40? Do you know how good you have to be in order to be among the league's best second options at the age of 40? Your days as an All-NBA performer cannot be behind you. And James has proven, when healthy, he is still one of the league's 15 best players. Remarkably, he has not missed an All-NBA team since 2004. This season? It isn't starting out great. Sciatica will, at the very least, cost James the first week of his 23rd campaign. Any time anyone mentions the phrases \"40 years old\" and \"sciatica\" in the same breath, I can feel the pain in my own backside, but this is LeBron James we're talking about. He's been a superhuman force for more than two decades, and we'll not believe Father Time has him beat until the game is called. That said: There is some question about his fit with Dončić, especially on the defensive end. The Lakers allowed 117 points per 100 possessions whenever James and Dončić were in tandem last season, which would have ranked 26th in the league if averaged over a full season. That weakness was their fatal flaw, and the Lakers did little to address it over the summer, choosing Deandre Ayton as their rim protector. There is also some question about whether James understands he is the Lakers' second option. He has never been that in his career — until now — and while he has said all the right things since Los Angeles' acquisition of Dončić, there is a difference between saying what is necessary to win games and doing it. Besides Williams, Mobley was the only other player to crack both the All-NBA and All-Defensive rosters, making the second and first teams, respectively. He was also the league's Defensive Player of the Year. The 24-year-old's traditional statistics — 19-9-3 on 56/37/73 shooting splits — may not jump off the page, but he is capable of everything on a basketball court at nearly 7 feet tall, drawing favorable comparisons to a young Kevin Garnett. Offensively, he is a threat from the perimeter, the post or anywhere between, generating open looks as a scorer, a passer and a screen-setter. On the other end, he can defend all five positions in space or at the rim. He is long and athletic and skilled, all the physical attributes you'd want. Is he as manically driven toward superstardom as KG was? That is the question, for Cleveland's prospects as a title team — and not the second-round fodder it has been for the past two seasons — hinge on the development of Mobley. Here is a vote of confidence in his pursuit of an even higher spot on this list. Butler was a No. 1 option for the Miami Heat when last we visited this exercise a year ago and a damn good one at that. He led the Heat to NBA Finals appearances in 2020 and 2023 and demanded a trade last season once it became clear he could no longer reach those heights with their deteriorating roster. He landed in Golden State, where the Warriors were phenomenal in his brief time on the team. They finished 23-7 down the stretch with him in the lineup, outscoring opponents by double digits per 100 possessions whenever he was on the floor. They ousted the second-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs and only lost in the Western Conference semifinals once Stephen Curry was hurt. While Butler can still be a bona fide No. 1 if need be, his skill set is perfectly suited to complement any superstar, including Curry. He creates turnovers on defense and does not commit them on offense. Likewise, Butler gets to the free-throw line on offense and does not foul often on defense. He wins possessions, and over the course of a 14-year career that relentlessness has won more games than not. If only Butler knew how close Towns has drawn to him on this list . Towns was once considered a losing player, perpetually missing the playoffs on the Minnesota Timberwolves. They broke through to the 2024 Western Conference finals with him as their second-best player, supporting Anthony Edwards, only to trade him to New York, where he helped Jalen Brunson's Knicks to the 2025 Eastern Conference finals. That's right: Karl-Anthony Towns, my friends, is a winning basketball player. The Knicks were seven points per 100 meaningful possessions better when he was on the court during the regular season, according to Cleaning the Glass, and even better (+8.7) in the playoffs, ousting the defending champion Boston Celtics. There is still some concern about whether Towns' defensive issues — along with those of Brunson — will ultimately set New York's ceiling below championship level, but the East is as open as it has been in some time. If they are to win it, it will be on the defensive improvement of Towns, but as is he is an All-NBA third-team member who averaged a 24-13-3 last season on 53/42/83 shooting splits.

Rivers was back in his hometown over the weekend as his Bucks played the Bulls in a preseason game, and like most Chicagoans, he was angered by the presence of ICE agents and the attempt to bring in federalized National Guard troops to the city. There have been protests in the streets and in the courts about their presence . Rivers went on a pre-game rant about it, as reported by Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “It bothers me,” Rivers said. “I’m trying, I’m trying; I mean, it’s just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that’s not this country. That’s not what we’re about ... “I think every American is good with, if there’s criminals on the street, we want to arrest the criminals. My dad was a cop for Christ’s sakes. My dad would not be proud of this. I know that. My dad would have a major problem; I couldn’t imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they’re doing. I couldn’t imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he’d call in sick.” Maybe the most interesting part was Rivers pointing out the informational divide in the United States (something seen in the discussion around Chicago, Portland, Los Angeles and other cities the current administration has focused its attention on), as illustrated by a conversation he had with a couple in town supporting their daughter running the Chicago Marathon last weekend. “The couple was so proud, and they were saying, ‘man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I’ve never been to this city, wow,’” Rivers recounted. “And the dad says, ‘But we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere.’ And he was like, ‘Where is it?’ It’s nowhere. It’s just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I’m from Chicago. I’m very prideful about this place, so I hate it ... “I’m going to say this the last time and then move back to basketball. This should be about the morality of our country and not about the race. This has nothing to do with Black and White. Black and White should be grabbing arms together on this one and fighting against this.” The NBA has a long history of coaches speaking out on social issues, most legendarily former Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, but more recently the Warriors’ Steve Kerr.

It’s all fun and for the love of the game.” Embiid played Sunday at the Sixers’ Blue-White scrimmage and was a partial participant in Tuesday’s practice. Many Sixers have said he’s looked very good over the past few weeks and no one’s mentioned left knee problems. So … might Embiid play Friday in the team’s preseason finale vs. the Timberwolves? “I think there’s some chance, yeah,” Sixers head coach Nick Nurse said. “I don’t think we’re there yet; it’s a little early in the week to decide. It still could go either way. I think we’ve got some thresholds to get over yet before we get to that point.” Embiid’s last preseason appearance came on Oct. 20, 2023. Oubre and Tyrese Maxey are the only other holdovers from that Sixers team. Nurse said both Trendon Watford (right hamstring) and Paul George (left knee) participated in the “introductory” parts of practice. Neither sounds close to a return. Watford’s had minimal on-court time with his new teammates, which has contributed to the Sixers testing a variety of power forward options. “For sure it’s been a missed opportunity. … I would imagine there’s a little ways to go before we even get him out there in some live action,” Nurse said. “Hopefully, it’ll be soon. I think it makes evaluating really hard. He hasn’t really done anything in the fall or the training camp to date. But when we get him back, we’ll throw him in there and see what he’s got. That’s all we can do.” Quentin Grimes also watched the Sixers’ preseason loss last Friday to the Magic. He’s continued getting up to speed since accepting the Sixers' qualifying offer and expects to suit up against Minnesota. “Yeah, that’s the plan,” Grimes said, “playing on Friday. For sure.”"}

In fantasy basketball, format determines strategy — and in High Score (points-based) leagues, raw production is king. This scoring system rewards players who pile up points, assists, rebounds and defensive stats, while ignoring traditional pain points like field goal percentage and turnovers. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] The result? Players who are typically faded for their flaws suddenly become risers on draft boards. With the 2025–26 NBA season around the corner, here are four stars who should thrive in High Score. Surging assist rate + turnovers don't matter Young is built for High Score formats. Last season, the underappreciated All-Star averaged 24.2 points and a career-best 11.6 assists per game, leading the NBA in dimes and reaffirming his role as one of the game's most dynamic playmakers. In category leagues, his value tends to dip to a second-round value because he has committed 4.1 turnovers per game for his career while shooting 43% from the field — a couple of red flags that may cause one to punt in a category setting. In High Score, however, those fantasy warts are obsolete. With the Hawks sporting one of their deepest rosters in years, Young's playmaking workload is both efficient and sustainable. Surrounded by improved scorers and shooters, he's free to do what he does best — rack up stats without worrying about efficiency. I have him as a mid-first-round pick in High Score right now. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Injury risk subdued by scoring format Ball has missed 141 out of 246 games the past three seasons. That's over 57% of games missed due to injury over that span — quite concerning. So how could he be a value in High Score? Well, his ADP sits around the third round, even though he's capable of putting up first-round type production in a scoring system that accounts for the single-best game each week and won't factor in turnovers or FG percentage. In 47 games last year, Ball averaged 25.2 points, 7.4 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per contest while maintaining a career-high 35% usage rate — a number that's climbed every season he's been in the league. Even with his lowest true shooting percentage to date, the volume remains elite: Over 20 field goal attempts, 11 3s, and five free throws per game. The Hornets' retooled roster offers more potential assists — plus a softer Eastern Conference could help Charlotte push for a playoff spot. LaMelo has averaged 1.32 FPPM over the past three seasons, making him well worth the gamble in High Score. His output could make him a legitimate top-15 fantasy play when active. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt High Score draft results Health = wealth Williamson is one of the most efficient and productive fantasy players on a per-minute basis — and High Score scoring maximizes that strength. According to Cleaning the Glass , Zion ranked in the 100th percentile in both usage rate and assist percentage at his position last season. People forget he managed to play 70 games just a couple of seasons ago. But now there's much more on the line. Williamson's salary over the next few seasons is tied to his meeting weight, body fat and availability requirements . It's why he's arguably in the best shape of his life. Fantasy managers should take notice because he's literally playing for his money . And when he's on the court, only a handful of players are reaching his efficiency at 1.56 FPPM last season. In High Score formats, where you don't get docked for his limited 3s, low block totals or middling free-throw percentage, Williamson's unique mix of inside scoring and facilitating translates to a high-valued asset in High Score and points leagues outright. He's capable of repeating last year's production at 25/7/5. A window into returning to MVP-form The Sixers haven't provided a timeline for Embiid's return. Still, he participated in the Sixers' blue and white scrimmage (something he doesn't typically do) in the preseason, looking slender and moving fluidly. I'm buying into the slimmed-down version of Embiid, and relative to cost, you should, too. Embiid is on many no-draft lists, but in Round 5 — in High Score — he has the most boom potential of anyone being drafted in that range. Even if he sees a reduction in minutes upon his return, he puts in work on a per-minute basis. Somehow, Embiid managed to average 23.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.4 FPPM on one leg last year. Last year was a disaster. Embiid was never healthy after his Olympics run; he returned too early, and it showed. Now, with plenty of time off and the ability to rehab and get his body right, the former MVP seems to be trending in the right direction. The baked-in rest and maintenance days won't impact your fantasy lineup as much in High Score since you'll technically need him for just one boom performance each week. Like LaMelo and Zion, the ceiling outcomes outweigh the injury risk, especially where Embiid is going in drafts this season."}

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 50-32 (fifth in the West, lost to the Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs) Offensive rating : 114.3 (15th) Defensive rating : 109.4 (3rd) Additions: Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Brook Lopez, John Collins, Yanic Konan Niederhäuser, Kobe Sanders Subtractions: Norman Powell, Amir Coffey, Ben Simmons, Drew Eubanks, Patty Mills, Seth Lundy Complete roster OK, let’s get this out of the way: That isn’t really the biggest question surrounding the Clippers right now. The biggest questions all revolve around Kawhi Leonard: on what the NBA’s investigation into reporting about the possibility that the team circumvented the league’s salary cap by setting the superstar forward up with a \" no-show job \" that would effectively pay him up to $48 million off the books will turn up; on what impact, if any, that ongoing investigation might have on the off-court atmosphere around the team, or on the on-court performance of Leonard or his teammates, throughout this season; on what punishment, if any, the league might levy against the Clippers organization and its personnel, all the way up to owner Steve Ballmer ; and on how any sanctions might affect the long-term outlook of a franchise desperate for championship contention after advancing past the second round of the playoffs just once since its inception in 1970. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] I know that; you know that; dogs know that. But since none of us have any answers to any of them right now, and since we’ve all devoted plenty of hours (and will surely devote plenty more) to the latest twists and turns in the Aspiration saga, let’s spare a minute or two for what this Clippers team might actually look like on the basketball court this season … because it might be pretty good? The Clippers just won 50 games despite Leonard making just 37 appearances. While projecting Leonard’s availability is obviously a fool’s errand at this point, it’s worth noting that, amid all the chaos, he actually entered training camp healthy and is playing in the preseason — a far cry from 2024-25, when he didn’t make his debut until after New Year’s Day. At the risk of playing Captain Obvious here, Kawhi being on the floor is a very good thing for Tyronn Lue’s club; when he did play last season, the Clips won at a 58-win pace, and had the point differential of a 66-win team when he was on the floor . While getting Leonard healthy and available for the full season is the biggest move the Clippers could make, they also spent the summer adding pieces around the edges. Bidding farewell to Norman Powell after a career year hurts, but effectively plugging two players into his salary slot — Bradley Beal, in search of redemption after a disastrous sojourn in Phoenix , and John Collins, in search of games that actually matter after two years in the parallel noncompetitive universe that is Utah — ought to help. Beal (17 points per game on 50/39/80 shooting splits) and Collins (19 on 53/40/85) add some offensive spice, variety and versatility to a squad that finished in the middle of the pack in points scored per possession for the full season, but that ranked seventh after Leonard’s debut in early January . It remains to be seen who will start alongside Leonard, Beal , James Harden and Ivica Zubac come opening night; if nothing else, Lue has plenty of options. Stretch-5 Brook Lopez, too, brings a dose of floor-spacing prowess and a prospective pick-and-pop partner for ball-screen maestros like Harden and prodigal son Chris Paul , who was still really damn good last season next to Victor Wembanyama in San Antonio. Perhaps even more important, though, Lopez could help keep Lue’s coverages organized when All-Defensive Team center Zubac hits the bench. Last season, the Clips gave up 6.9 more points per 100 possessions without the Croatian big man patrolling the paint, according to Cleaning the Glass — the difference between preventing points at an elite level and a below-average rate. The former Bucks big man might not be quite as excellent an interior deterrent as he was earlier in his tenure in Milwaukee, but he could be devastatingly effective in a more limited role behind Zubac … and, in certain matchups, maybe even alongside him. (Pardon me while I daydream about kaiju battles between Zu-Brook and Şengün-Adams, Jokić-Valančiūnas and Hartenstein-Chet.) Add those newcomers to holdovers like Nicolas Batum, Kris Dunn, Derrick Jones Jr. and (the currently injured ) Bogdan Bogdanović, and you’ve got a rotation that can go a legit 11 deep … which, as we learned over the course of the runs that the Thunder and Pacers made to the 2025 NBA Finals, is a recipe for being able to survive the intense, grueling pressure of the modern postseason. There is, of course, a glaring, gigantic difference between the team L.A. has put together and the ones that OKC and Indiana rode to June. Yes, this roster is old — like, historically old, as Tom Haberstroh and I detailed on \"The Big Number\" : And old teams typically don’t fare all that well come the end of the marathon NBA season, as Jared Dubin detailed at Last Night in Basketball : The last over-30 team to win the title was the 2013 Heat. All but one title team since then has had a minutes-weighted age below 29. Notably, the lone exception was the 2020 Lakers, who won the title in the NBA bubble — under far different circumstances than most title teams. (They didn't have to travel during the playoffs, which seems like a particularly big thing.) An over-30 team hasn't been to the Finals at all since 2018, which was the last season that LeBron's Cavaliers teams dominated the Eastern Conference. [...] In the last decade, 10 of the 40 conference-finalists have had a minutes-weighted age of 26 or younger and just one (those 2018 Cavs) has had a minutes-weighted age over 30. In the last five years, only four teams with a minutes-weighted age over 28 have made it as far as the conference finals. Most conference-finalists and title winners still fall in the general prime age range of 26-29 years old, but things are definitely skewing a lot younger than they used to. And when you're talking about a team with title aspirations, it feels like that matters. [ Get more Clippers news: Los Angeles team feed ] (For the record: Jared wrote that last line before all the Aspiration stuff broke. Sometimes, the universe just turns up a happy accident, y’all.) If — when — multiple members of the oldest rotation in NBA history suffer some bumps and bruises, it seems like a lot to ask end-of-the-bench youngsters like Kobe Brown, Cam Christie, Jordan Miller and No. 30 pick Yanic Konan Niederhäuser to offer any respite. The Clippers’ chances of rising above the fray in a brutal West rest with how well Lue can manage the minutes of his veteran group, and if he’ll be able to keep enough of the right plates spinning late into April and May to keep the whole thing from coming crashing down before June once again. An utterly unfazed and unbothered Kawhi plays 70 games for the first time since San Antonio at an All-NBA First Team level, allowing everybody else to fit comfortably into their complementary roles. Harden remains one of the game’s premier orchestrators, and Paul ably serves as an understudy in his absence. Beal bounces back, Collins seizes the opportunity, everybody else stars in their role, and Lue pulls all the right levers. The Clippers win 55 games, finish with a top-two seed in the West and home-court advantage in Round 1 … and a healthy Kawhi leads them back to the Western Conference finals. Kawhi gets hurt, and Beal thinks the cure for what ails the Clipper offense is more Beal. (It isn’t.) Old guys do what old guys do: namely, miss time, and lots of it. Lue’s press conferences start carrying a considerable amount of existential dread, as he tries without success to describe the frustration and hopelessness of coaching a roster that is just never going to have all the pieces there. The defense splinters, the offense sputters and the Clips miss the playoffs … … at which point the NBA announces the results of its investigation. Which, since they’re coming in this section, are really, really bad. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Utah Complete schedule Ty Lue won 50 with Kawhi missing more than half the season, and this team is better. I’ll take the over.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 49-33 (sixth in the West, lost to the Thunder in the Western Conference finals) Offensive rating : 115.7 (8th) Defensive rating : 110.8 (6th) Additions : Joan Beringer Subtractions : Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luka Garza, Josh Minott Complete roster The Timberwolves have made consecutive conference finals appearances for the first time in franchise history, establishing themselves among the NBA's power players. They are led by a 24-year-old Anthony Edwards, so they should not be going anywhere anytime soon, but the status quo is not good enough. The goal for any team is to win the championship, and it should be no different in Minnesota, where they can boast that Edwards is a top-five player — exactly the kind of performer a team needs to win the title. He has finished top-seven in MVP voting and made the All-NBA second team each of the past two years. He is right there on the precipice. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Only, it has not been good enough. The Wolves eventually ran into teams led by better players, losing to Luka Dončić's Dallas Mavericks in 2024 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's Oklahoma City Thunder in 2025. The Wolves need Edwards to be the best player on the floor in every series, and there is a real chance he could be. He averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game on 45/40/84 shooting splits last season, adding 5.7 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. The game's best are more efficient scorers or playmakers or both. The Wolves actually performed 0.6 points per 100 possessions better when Edwards was off the court last season, which should not happen for a great player. Edwards should be impacting the game on both ends of the floor in a way that elevates his teammates, which he did for the most part in the playoffs, as Minnesota was 5.1 points per 100 possessions better in the postseason when he was on the court. Edwards struggled at times with double teams last season, expressing his frustration publicly, and that is not what a winner needs from its best player, either. The Wolves need Edwards to have seen every coverage and have a solution each time, which comes with more seasoning. This is Year 6 for him. Remember: Edwards is only 24, and it is not usually until around ages 26 or 27 that superstars come into their own as champions. LeBron James and Michael Jordan are prime examples. Same goes for Jayson Tatum and Gilgeous-Alexander. We can imagine how good Edwards could be in a couple of years. But the Timberwolves are prepared to win now. Their All-Defensive center, Rudy Gobert, is 33 years old. Their point guard, Mike Conley, is 37. Julius Randle, their inconsistent co-star, turns 31 in November. They feature a 25-year-old Jaden McDaniels, a 26-year-old Naz Reid and recent first-round picks Rob Dillingham, Terrence Shannon Jr. and Joan Beringer, but the core of this team is prepared to contend now. [ Get more Timberwolves news: Minnesota team feed ] It certainly is being paid that way. How quickly Minnesota must pivot to a new plan depends on how quickly Edwards can establish himself as capable of being the best player in any series. If he is ready to make the leap this season, the Wolves have to be prepared to meet him at this moment. Is this the roster to do it? Do they need another piece? Do not act too soon, for sacrificing assets when Edwards is not prepared is a fool's errand. One would like to see him take a step forward this season, but if he doesn't make the full leap, will Gobert, Conley and Randle fall a step behind? If Edwards is not ready, it may be time to plan for two years from now, when he should be, and that could mean a culture shift toward the younger core — and veterans on the move. Edwards makes the full leap, establishing himself as a serious MVP candidate. Randle's inconsistency yields one of his better seasons. Gobert is Gobert. Conley is Conley. McDaniels rises along with Edwards. One of, if not all of, Dillingham, Shannon and Beringer show real promise as potential impact playoff guys, masking the departure of Nickeil Alexander-Walker. And the Wolves are capable of winning the West. Edwards shows little signs of progress as a playmaker. Randle endures one of his tottering seasons. That in itself could be enough to drop the Timberwolves a tier below the West's elite, especially as the Denver Nuggets and Houston Rockets have improved. It might be time to consider trading Gobert, if there are any takers, embracing Reid as the center of the future and building for the time when Edwards is ready. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Portland Complete schedule Edwards has manned a team that has won 105 games over the past two seasons, and this year the Timberwolves will have another season of continuity between him and Randle. The young guys are good. The old guys are still good. Take the over. While you're at it, maybe even take a long shot bet on Edwards as the MVP. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • LA Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

While it’s important to note that the simulation is just one of thousands ESPN completed before the start of the season, the results speak to a retooled Warriors roster expected to make noise in the Western Conference this year.

But it was nonetheless painful to see the veteran big man spell out why he decided to move on from the Celtics and sign with the Golden State Warriors in free agency . “I think that where Boston was as a team, even though I called them my home and everything was there for me, they just weren’t in a position to offer me the opportunity that I wanted,\" Horford told The Athletic's Nick Friedell . Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! Horford cited two specific areas where the Celtics fell short: financially and competitively. And in his view, Jayson Tatum's devastating Achilles injury in May changed everything, transforming the C's from a legitimate contender that may need minor offseason tinkering to a team more focused on getting under the second apron of the luxury tax ahead of the 2026-27 season. \"I think the financial part was a component, but more than that, it was the winning part of it, trying to contend for a championship,\" Horford told Friedell. \"And I think there was a lot of things up in the air -- and it just felt like they weren’t in the same, that same vision, obviously, because JT getting hurt, that takes a big toll. \"So I think at that point I really had to -- up until then I was staying in Boston the whole time.\" That's a fair take from Horford, who admitted the Celtics' early-offseason trades of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis made it \"clear\" to him that Boston \"had different priorities.\" Even if Tatum supercharges his rehab , a C's team without Holiday, Porzingis and Luke Kornet probably isn't in the NBA championship conversation. But here's where the motivation factor comes in: In his quest to earn one more ring, Horford chose ... the Warriors. While any team with Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler shouldn't be written off, Golden State has the NBA's second-oldest roster (average age: 29) and currently has the 10th-best championship odds (+2200) on ESPN Bet . The Celtics? They're 12th, with +3000 odds. So, if a Boston team that's already being written off without Tatum needs another reason to overachieve, why not aim for being better than the Warriors? Golden State is the better team on paper, but any injuries on a veteran-laden roster could send its season south in a hurry. The Celtics, meanwhile, can still roll out a starting five of players who were on the 2024 title team -- Payton Pritchard, Derrick White, Jaylen Brown, Sam Hauser and Neemias Queta -- and brought in energetic role players with chips on their shoulders such as Josh Minott, Luka Garza and Chris Boucher. Horford is entitled to his decision, and he'll always hold a special place in Celtics history for what he contributed over seven total seasons in Boston. But now that he's in Golden State, the Celtics should do everything in their power to prove the beloved big man wrong."}

Discover underrated NBA players poised for breakout seasons to help you dominate your fantasy draft.", "body": "Manage your account ... Winning your fantasy league starts with finding the best fantasy basketball sleepers—undervalued NBA players with breakout potential. In this guide, we highlight mid-round value picks and late-round steals you need to know heading into your 2025 draft. These NBA fantasy sleepers are flying under the radar based on current ADP, lineup shifts, and injury reports. Whether you're digging through NBA projections, keeping up with the latest NBA news, or targeting upside, these are the best NBA fantasy basketball sleepers to help you win big this season. These are players that will certainly be drafted but are worth the risk of grabbing a bit sooner than expected to secure their significant potential. The forward is a multi-dimensional player primed to take on a larger and more consistent role from last season. With the Bulls making a shift towards focusing on their younger core, he will have the green light on offense, while he also has the size and quickness to block shots on the defensive end. George may play off the bench, but his ability to score and distribute at a high level should result in him racking up the stats in what could resemble a sixth-man role. He has also shown a knack for contributing on the glass, which will help round out his overall production. The point guard has bounced around the league over the last few seasons but has made impressive statements on the international stage in recent summers, leading Germany to a FIBA World Cup and a EuroBasket championship. He is set for a fresh start with the Kings, where he is surrounded by top-tier offensive talent that should help his own production. The rookie is set to take on a starting role with the Jazz and has already turned heads with a couple of notable preseason performances. His six-foot-eight frame stacks up very well against competition at the wing, and he could quickly become a top scoring option for his squad. Jackson was limited to just five games due to injury last season, but with the departure of Myles Turner, he is in line to take on the starting center job for the Pacers. He should fit in well with their fast-paced style of play and could take a major leap in production in a much more significant role compared to his first four seasons. Grimes stunned the league by pouring in impressive point totals after being traded to the 76ers last season. He is back for his second campaign with the squad and will have the opportunity to pick up where he left off. He would also be right back in position to take on a leading role in the offense should either Paul George or Joel Embiid become unavailable. The well-rounded wing may find himself mostly in a bench role after the Bulls' acquisition of Isaac Okoro. However, he is a tough competitor with a proven ability to contribute across the stat sheet and will certainly see significant action. He could also work his way back into a role as a starter, which he earned last season, before injuries took him out of the loop. The 2022 No. 6 overall pick is set to take on a starting role following a shift within the Pacers' lineup due to the absence of Tyrese Haliburton. He has proven able to provide an impact across the board through his first three seasons but has not had the chance to break out while mostly limited to a bench role. He could be up for a career season and take his game to new heights as a result of the increased opportunity. These are players who are likely to slip to the final rounds or not be drafted at all in many leagues but who may become highly sought-after targets off the waiver wire. The recently-extended Jovic has all the tools to be a strong contributor across the board but has not been able to achieve much consistency over his first three seasons. However, he showed solid production in relation to his playing time last year, and he remains in position to handle a key part of the Heat's frontcourt rotation. A veteran big, Boucher has a new home with the Celtics. Although he is expected to begin the season in a bench role, he could potentially make a case to move up as a starter, especially considering the squad does not have any clear-cut standouts in the frontcourt. His long-range shooting, ability to run the floor and shot-blocking provide many opportunities for him to rack up stats. Bona elevated his game towards the end of last season, showing that he can score, rebound and block shots at an impressive rate. With Joel Embiid's ability to remain available in question, Bona could find himself thrust into a major role at any time. Nonetheless, he should be able to deliver notable production even from a bench role. The wing could find himself in a starting role for the Jazz in his third NBA season. He has shown flashes of potential to be a 20-point-per-game scorer, including knocking down shots with efficiency from long range. While his squad is not beholden to any major expectations, he should have the opportunity to carve a path as a high-volume contributor. The talented scorer was unable to find a consistent role among the Rockets' lineup, but it was less due to his ability and more a result of their many options at the wing. He should have a much better opportunity to take ownership of a place in the rotation with the Wizards and could even break into the starting lineup if there is a time when the veteran Khris Middleton is unavailable. Grant could find himself in a bench role for the Trail Blazers, behind Toumani Camara. However, he will likely still see significant playing time and could end up on the floor to close games with regularity. He averaged over 19 points per game for four straight seasons before injuries limited his usage in 2024-25. Butler is set to debut for the Suns, where he is expected to take on a backup role behind Devin Booker at point guard. He has shown flashes of an ability to rack up significant numbers in points and assists, but inconsistent opportunity has limited him. However, with the makeup of the Suns roster, his services should be required on a more steady basis, which could result in a career season."}

In an exclusive interview with NBC Sports Bay Area's Kerith Burke on \"Dubs Talk,\" the 22-year-old guard reflected on his growth and how he is preparing to take another step forward — potentially into a full-time starting role. \"Yeah, I think so,\" Podziemski said when asked if he’s making a case to start. \"I think selfishly, everybody wants to be a starter, but it comes down to what’s best for the team at that moment and in that game, so I think I work and prepare and do those things in the summer to showcase that I am a starter and that I belong and that I can be a household name for the Warriors, and that’s always my goal and what I look forward to. But like I said, the team comes first. Whatever Steve [Kerr] and the team thinks is best is what we do and that’s what I’ve been ok with.\" With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Podziemski appeared in 64 regular-season games last season, starting 33 of them, and averaged 11.7 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists while shooting 37.2 percent from 3-point range. He also started 10 of 11 playoff games despite playing through an injury , showing poise well beyond his years. The 2023 first-round draft pick knows earning that starting spot means complementing the Warriors’ biggest star: Steph Curry . Playing alongside the 16-year veteran requires constant motion and chemistry — two things Podziemski believes he steadily has mastered. \"I think a lot of people make it a lot more complicated than it is,\" Podziemski said about learning to play with Curry. \"It’s a unique thing, he is a unique player that kind of runs around the floor, so it’s a little bit unique, but once you get the hang of it, like anything, the more you do something the easier it becomes, so I think I’ve developed a great connection with him, with Jimmy [Butler], with Draymond [Green], so I think I fit perfectly for that spot next to him.\" Podziemski spent his first two seasons learning from Curry and Green, players whose leadership defines the franchise. He even hopes to one day help carry that torch when they retire — though for now, he’s content to learn from the ones still holding it. Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. \"Obviously, like I said, it comes down to whatever they think too, so I'm just ready for whatever is presented and given my way,\" Podziemski added. That mindset — trusting the process and staying ready for whatever’s presented — has defined Podziemski’s rise so far, and it might just carry him into a permanent role.

The 6-foot-8 Flagg shifted to point guard after starting the first two preseason games at forward, the position he played at Duke. He averaged 12.0 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists during his two starts at point guard in a lineup alongside 6-6 Klay Thompson , 6-7 P.J. Washington , 6-10 Anthony Davis and 7-1 Dereck Lively II . \"He's got to keep an index of who got shots, what was the last shot, and that'll come with reps,\" said Kidd, who started offseason free agency addition D'Angelo Russell at point guard in the Mavs' first two preseason games. \"But I think [Flagg] has done an incredible job of handling the situation of running the team. And the other thing that I think that is going unnoticed is that his teammates enjoy him running the team.\" But Kidd said he thought the Mavs' offense was too stagnant early in Wednesday's game, when the Lakers jumped out to a 22-10 lead before Flagg subbed out midway through the first quarter. There are spacing concerns with that lineup because of a relative lack of playmaking and perimeter shooting, as the Mavs' starters shot 3-of-15 from 3-point range against the Lakers. \"Just continuing to get comfortable,\" Flagg said. \"I made some mental lapses today, time and score situations. Got to know [and] be aware of what's on the clock at all times. Just got to stay more attached [defensively]. Can't let a hot player keep getting looks. So some of those things you can definitely clean up.\" Flagg, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, struggled early in Wednesday's game while defending Gabe Vincent , who had 18 points and hit five 3s in the first 4 minutes, 9 seconds. \"No matter if you're 6-4, 6-2 or 6-8, when you're in a pick-and-roll in this league against guys who know how to run the pick-and-roll, it's hard,\" Kidd said. \"It becomes a two-man game, and we'll get better at that. But [with] his competitiveness, he's going to figure it out sooner than later, and the more he's in these situations, I think the long run he's going to benefit.\""}

(0:58) Sacramento Kings forward Keegan Murray has agreed to a five-year, $140 million rookie contract extension with the franchise, representatives Mark Bartelstein and Kyle McAlarney of Priority Sports told ESPN. Murray, the No. 4 pick in the 2022 NBA draft, secures a long-term extension to remain a key two-way wing in Sacramento through 2030-31. Murray hit the ground running with the Kings in his first season, making the All-Rookie team and helping Sacramento end its playoff drought as a full-time starter. His offensive numbers have plateaued some since that season, but he has developed as a strong defender, a big need for an offensively slanted Kings team. He is one of three players to record 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the past three seasons, along with Minnesota's Anthony Edwards and Boston's Derrick White , according to ESPN Research. He serves as the Kings' primary perimeter defender, guarding 2025 All-Stars for 1,005 half-court matchups last season, fifth most in the NBA. Murray averaged 12.4 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 34.3 minutes in 76 games last season. The 25-year-old had been remarkably healthy through the first three years of his career, having played 233 out of 246 total games, starting all but two of them. However, he will miss at least the first 10 games this season after suffering a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb during a preseason game and undergoing surgery. Murray is one of seven players to make at least 150 3-pointers in each of his first three NBA seasons, according to ESPN Research. His absence means the Kings will be without a crucial floor spacer and their most trusted stopper in the opening month as they look to compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. Murray is the sixth player to agree to a rookie extension this year ahead of Monday's 11:59 p.m. ET deadline. Information from ESPN's Anthony Slater was used in this report."}

(0:58) Nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook has agreed on a deal to sign with the Sacramento Kings , agent Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports Management told ESPN on Wednesday. Westbrook and the Kings maintained communication all offseason as the 2017 NBA MVP remained patient in free agency and now lands a deal for his 18th season. Westbrook has bonds with Domantas Sabonis , DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , history alongside Dennis Schroder in the backcourt and with assistant general manager BJ Armstrong on the player representation side, and shared respect for general manager Scott Perry and coach Doug Christie. Westbrook is expected to officially join the team later this week on a one-year, $3.6 million veteran's minimum deal, sources said. Westbrook gives Sacramento some much-needed backcourt depth as a point guard able to play as a starter or reserve. The Kings could use his bench presence after ranking 28th in bench points per game and 29th in bench assists per game last season. In his first season as Kings general manager, Perry has made clear that the franchise wants a team culture of high motor and high effort -- attributes that Westbrook has displayed over his NBA career. In 75 games and 36 starts for the Denver Nuggets last season, Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals while shooting 44.9% from the field. Westbrook shot 52% on 2-pointers in 2024-25, the best in a season in his career. Westbrook has come off the bench in 145 of his 216 games played over the past three seasons while finishing in the top 10 in Sixth Man of the Year voting in each season. Westbrook, who turns 37 in November, has the most triple-doubles in NBA history (203) and is one of two players ever to play in the league to post 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists, along with LeBron James . Westbrook has 26,205 career points and needs another 506 to surpass Oscar Robertson as the highest-scoring point guard in NBA history. Westbrook also ranks eighth in career assists and needs 75 assists to become the eighth player with 10,000 career assists in league history. Westbrook, who left the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2018-19 as a franchise legend, is now on his seventh team ( Houston Rockets , Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , LA Clippers , Nuggets and Kings)."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

(0:50) SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD COOPER FLAGG had not yet played a single game for Duke when he walked into UNLV's Mendenhall Center on the afternoon of July 8, 2024. But he piqued the curiosity of the future Hall of Famers preparing for the trip to Paris to play for Team USA in the 2024 Olympics. Flagg had been the most hyped and anticipated American high school prospect since LeBron James , who was the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft more than three years before Flagg was born. James and the rest of Team USA were quite familiar with Flagg's name, if not yet his game. It had been more than a decade since an amateur had been invited to play for the Team USA select squad. Doug McDermott and Marcus Smart were accomplished collegians when they received the call in 2013. This scrimmage at Team USA's training camp would be the biggest test yet for the teenage phenom. Would Flagg be intimidated facing perennial All-Stars he grew up watching on TV? Would he be jittery playing in a small gym with NBA coaches and executives surrounding the court? The answer: absolutely not. \"Zero nerves,\" 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis told ESPN, recalling his first impression of the 6-foot-9 forward who will start alongside him this season in the Dallas Mavericks ' frontcourt. \"He went out and balled.\" Flagg is back in Las Vegas for one last tuneup entering his rookie season, as the Mavericks play the Los Angeles Lakers in their preseason finale Wednesday night at T-Mobile Arena. But Flagg's welcome-to-the-NBA moment occurred 15 months ago about 2½ miles away, when he made it clear he could make an immediate impact in the league, although he'd have to wait a season to become draft-eligible. Flagg was already the consensus favorite to be the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft when he arrived at the Team USA training camp in Vegas. If there was any doubt that he'd go No. 1 in the draft, it was eliminated by the end of the scrimmage, when the Olympic squad survived a Flagg-fueled comeback to squeak out a 74-73 win. It only amplified the anticipation for Flagg as he headed to Duke, where he again more than met expectations, earning national player of the year honors while leading the Blue Devils in every major statistical category en route to an ACC title and a Final Four appearance. Now, after the veteran-laden Mavs stunningly cashed in 1.8% lottery odds to land Flagg with the No. 1 pick, the expectation is that Flagg can expand his game as a rookie while proving himself as the rare teenager ready to affect winning right away in the NBA. \"I don't know if it was about proving anything to myself or just feeling comfortable and getting confidence from that experience,\" Flagg told ESPN. \"I definitely just had that feeling that I knew I belonged. I knew I could be out there.\" WHILE STUDYING TAPE of Flagg doing everything at Duke, Mavs coach Jason Kidd wondered if Flagg could do even more. Kidd saw shades of another former Duke star in Flagg's game: Grant Hill, who shared the Rookie of the Year award with Kidd in 1994-95, when the 6-foot-8 Hill ran the point a lot for the Detroit Pistons . Kidd saw the same phenomenal blend of feel and force in Flagg that Hill had coming out of Duke. \"I saw that, too,\" Hill, who as managing director of Team USA invited Flagg to join the program's select team and called some of his college games for CBS, told ESPN. \"He tries to play the complete game. You look up and he's got 22 points and it doesn't even feel like he looked to score. He's so unselfish. He defends. He just tries to do what's necessary to win games.\" When Flagg arrived in Dallas, Kidd was determined to find out how he could handle point guard responsibilities. Kidd also wanted to see how Flagg would handle an unfamiliar role. That experiment started during his brief stint in the Las Vegas Summer League, which had mixed results as the Mavs split the two games that Flagg played at the Thomas & Mack Center. Flagg shot poorly in the summer opener, going 5-of-21 from the field, but found his way to put his fingerprints on the defining sequence of the win over the Lakers. With a little more than a minute remaining, Flagg swooped in from the weak side to swat a layup attempt, pushed the ball in transition, drew three defenders in the paint and dished to a teammate for an open 3-pointer that gave Dallas the lead for good. Flagg scored 31 points in 31 minutes in the second game, a loss to the San Antonio Spurs . The Mavs had seen enough -- especially pleased with how Flagg handled pressure while bringing the ball up the court -- and shut him down for the rest of summer league. \"He handled the situation as well as an 18-year-old could handle it,\" said Kidd, who started Flagg at point guard in a jumbo-sized lineup in Monday's preseason win over the Utah Jazz . \"He has a talent about winning. It is in his DNA, and so it would be unfair not to make him uncomfortable.\" THE MOST MEMORABLE moments of Flagg's time at the national team's training camp, according to Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, who was in charge of the Team USA select squad, didn't occur during the scrimmage. They happened during the few practices and meetings the select squad held beforehand. Flagg's inquisitiveness and intelligence impressed Mosley, who especially enjoyed an in-depth dialogue between Flagg and Magic guard Jalen Suggs about the intricacies of NBA defense. \"He asked a lot of questions,\" Mosley told ESPN. \"I think it's huge for a young guy in this situation to be able to ask the right questions. He just wanted to understand what it looks like at the next level. He's a communicator, and that said a lot to me about him. Guys like that with high basketball IQs that want to play the right way will ask questions.\" Then Flagg delivered a fearless performance in the scrimmage. \"He wasn't afraid of the moment and who he was going against,\" Mosley said. \"He was himself. I think he walked in with the quiet confidence, but then when he got on the court with those guys, that demeanor didn't change any at all.\" Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . If there is such a thing as a signature stretch during a scrimmage, Flagg put one together with a late scoring flurry as the select team rallied from a double-digit deficit. He hit a baseline turnaround from the left block over Jrue Holiday . He rose up from the right wing to drill an off-dribble 3 in Davis' face. And Flagg flew in for an and-1 tip-in over Bam Adebayo , eliciting a roar from the entire select team bench. Those three buckets came against a trio of defenders with a combined 16 All-Defensive team selections. Flagg didn't celebrate any of them, maintaining a quiet, focused sense of calm. He called his select team stint \"a big learning experience,\" but nothing he did against the Olympians surprised Flagg. \"He was cooking,\" Davis said. \"He definitely stood out. Guys obviously were hearing the name, and we all knew who he was. But a lot of guys tend to, I don't want to say be hesitant, but when you're going against guys like myself, Bron, Steph [Curry], you see these guys and it's like, 'Oh s---.' \"You look up to and you idolize these guys, and now you got to go play against them. You kind of get nervous, which is normal. But for him, he has the utmost confidence in himself.\" Flagg's scoring dominated the media coverage of the scrimmage, but that isn't what made the strongest impression on Steve Kerr, the former Team USA coach. Kerr was wowed by Flagg's command of the game at such a young age against elite competition. \"I just remember the force you felt,\" Kerr told ESPN. \"You immediately felt him. And it was as a basketball player. It wasn't just like he had a huge dunk or something. No. It was the passing, the cutting, the late-clock, left-handed jump hook on the block when the offense had nothing else. It was so consistent. \"I'm coaching against him and we have the best players. He's got incredible feel. He's just huge but plays like a guard in terms of reading the game.\" Kerr recalled seeing Duke coach Jon Scheyer in the gym after the scrimmage. \"I said, 'That had to make you feel good,'\" Kerr said. \"He just smiled.\" Kidd knows the feeling. ESPN's Anthony Slater contributed to this report."}

(0:46) The NBA season begins Tuesday, but that isn't the only thing on the minds of league executives in the coming days. The deadline for rookie extensions (and for veterans signed past this season) is 6 p.m. ET Monday, roughly 24 hours before the Houston Rockets travel to face the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder to tip off the 2025-26 season. Heading into this season, we've already seen several players from the 2022 draft class sign extensions with their teams. Paolo Banchero , Chet Holmgren and Jabari Smith Jr . -- the first, second and third picks in that draft by the Orlando Magic , Thunder and Rockets, respectively -- signed long-term deals with those teams in July. As did Jalen Williams (No. 12 by OKC) this offseason and Nikola Jovic (No. 27 by the Miami Heat ) last month. On Wednesday, the Sacramento Kings and Keegan Murray (No. 4) settled on a five-year, $140 million pact, per ESPN's Shams Charania. Of the 15 players from that class who remain extension eligible between now and Monday, how many will also land long-term deals with their current teams? Keep in mind, 14 out of the 25 players who signed rookie extensions in 2023 and 2024 signed on the last day eligible. And by Monday, teams will also have to reduce their rosters to 15 on standard contracts. With all that in mind, we assessed the market for 10 of the biggest names in the rookie extension pool, laid out the most interesting negotiations left on the board and explained how we think they will each play out Dyson Daniels , Atlanta Hawks Hawks guard Dyson Daniels has been a huge success story for Atlanta. Troy Taormina-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Daniels is a huge success story for Atlanta. He came to the Hawks last summer as part of the trade that sent Dejounte Murray to the New Orleans Pelicans and became the NBA's Most Improved Player last season while leading the league in steals (229, the most in a season by any player since Gary Payton in 1995-96). The Hawks were able to get a deal done at the deadline with Jalen Johnson last year, and it wouldn't be hard to see them find a way to get one done for Daniels. -- Tim Bontemps Why it might not: His agent, Daniel Moldovan, is using the five-year, $150 million extension Jalen Suggs signed last year as the comparison for Daniels, while also assessing Trae Young 's uncertain future in Atlanta. Daniels was named first-team All-Defense, finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and increased his offensive production from 5.8 to 14.1 points. But Young has a $49 million player option next season and has been eligible to sign an extension since mid-June. -- Bobby Marks What I would offer: Five years, $125 million. The contract would remain flat at $25 million per season. Factoring in the new contract for Daniels, and Young's player option, Atlanta would be $26 million below the luxury tax and comfortably beneath both aprons. -- Marks Will it happen?: If last year's negotiations with Johnson are a guide -- where the two sides haggled over it and then got a deal done right before the deadline -- then this one probably will go right up to Monday's deadline. The guess here is something gets done, but landing on a number both sides agree on could be difficult. -- Bontemps Christian Braun and Peyton Watson , Denver Nuggets Why an extension could get done : Braun has become an integral part of Denver's operation, helping the Nuggets win their first NBA title as a rookie and then stepping into the starting lineup last season in Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 's spot at shooting guard. He's the one clear long-term building block the Nuggets have. Watson, meanwhile, is a pogo-stick athlete who also brings an interesting skill set alongside Nikola Jokic , making him appealing for a long-term deal. -- Bontemps Why it might not: The Nuggets shaved nearly $17 million off their cap ledger for next season after they traded Michael Porter Jr . for Cameron Johnson . But Denver is projected to be $24 million below the apron, not including new contracts for Braun and Watson, as they enter the first year of Aaron Gordon 's extension. They could get $10 million in salary relief, but at the cost of waiving Jonas Valanciunas . The veteran's contract is guaranteed if he is on the roster past 11:59 p.m. ET on June 29. -- Marks Breaking News from Shams Charania Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . What I would offer: Let's first address the elephant in the room. Even if the Nuggets waive Valanciunas, Denver is still a second apron team if both Watson and Braun extend, and then the roster is filled out with players on minimum contracts. There is no dancing around that financial hurdle unless there is a trade to clear out money. As for Braun, team executives pointed to the five-year, $150 million extension Suggs signed with Orlando as the number to watch. But two red flags come with that. First, Suggs earned second-team All-Defense in 2024 and was paid because of his impact on the defensive end. Braun, on the other hand, averaged career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks last season and became the first player since Buddy Hield in 2018-19 with at least 400 fast-break points. Second, Orlando at the time had the financial wiggle room to start Suggs at $35 million per season and the flexibility to improve its roster. The Nuggets do not have the same flexibility. A five-year, $126.5 million extension for Braun that starts at $21.8 million would be a solid compromise for both sides. Braun's salary next season ranks in the top 15 of shooting guards. Watson's extension is more difficult to project because of his upside (he just turned 23) and his role coming off the bench. A four-year, $54 million extension would be team-friendly, considering next year's salary is $3 million below the non-tax midlevel exception. -- Marks Will it happen?: Braun's deal feels most likely to happen. He's too important to what Denver is trying to do, and cost certainty on his deal ahead of restricted free agency next summer will be critical. Though Watson is an intriguing player, given how Zeke Nnaji 's extension has aged for the Nuggets, it would be a bit surprising if Denver does a similar thing with Watson now, particularly with how their finances look going forward. -- Bontemps Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren , Detroit Pistons A deal for both Jaden Ivey (23) and Jalen Duren (0) will be difficult to accomplish. Grace Smith/USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Ivey was showing signs of improvement before an unfortunate leg injury cost him the final few months of last season. His skill set could pair nicely with Cade Cunningham in the backcourt moving forward. For Duren, the argument is simple: He's a 21-year-old who averaged a double-double in his first season under J.B. Bickerstaff, and both sides hope he can continue to improve this season and beyond. -- Bontemps Why it might not: How much do the Pistons consider the broken left fibula Ivey suffered on Jan. 1? GM Trajan Langdon said before the start of training camp that there are no restrictions on Ivey, but that does not mean Detroit should take an aggressive stand with his next contract until it can evaluate him during the regular season. Duren's future comes down to not wanting to pay a center the high premium. Since 2020, there have been only two bigs -- Alperen Sengun and Jaren Jackson Jr . -- who have signed a non-max rookie extension starting at $20 million or more. -- Marks What I would offer: The Pistons handed out a five-year, $269 million extension to Cunningham in 2024 but still have financial runway to sign both players to lucrative extensions and flexibility to improve either in free agency or a trade. A five-year, $112.5 million extension for Duren would start at $25.6 million and decline to $19.4 million in the last season. The contract takes into consideration what Duren accomplished in his first three seasons and also his upside. He is one of five players in NBA history with at least 100 career double-doubles before turning 22. The Ivey extension would be four years, $86.5 million, with an up-and-down structure. The first year's salary would start at $23.9 million, then decline to $19.3 million in the last year. Including a prior injury exclusion (exhibit 3) would protect Detroit if Ivey suffers another injury to the same leg. -- Marks Will it happen?: It feels unlikely either of these will get done. There are just too many complicating factors in getting to a fair number for Ivey, making it more likely both sides will let this season play out and revisit next summer. And while Duren is young and showed improvement last season, there are questions about his rim protection long term and making a big bet on him now feels beyond what Detroit will ultimately do. It is also worth noting that this front office didn't draft either of these players. -- Bontemps Tari Eason , Houston Rockets Why an extension could get done: Eason is an analytical darling who has been consistent for the Rockets since being drafted No. 17 in 2022. Though it's likely he again comes off the bench this season, combo forwards with his skill set and ability to disrupt play at both ends are highly valued, and Houston has shown an ability to continually get its young core players locked into good contracts. -- Bontemps Why it might not: The Rockets probably will consider Eason's season-ending surgery on his left leg in the 2023-24 season and the 22 games he sat out last season because of the same leg. He played all 82 games in his rookie season but only a combined 59 in the past two. Eason has started only 16 games and probably will be in that sixth-man role again this season. Houston also signed Jabari Smith to an extension that starts at $23.6 million next season, and is expected to sign Kevin Durant to an extension. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $80 million. The apron era has taught teams to prioritize their own pending free agents and balance future finances. With Amen Thompson eligible to sign an extension next summer, it is hard to justify an average salary of $20 million or more for a player coming off the bench. -- Marks Will it happen?: This feels as if it will get done eventually. With Eason's injury history, locking in some long-term financial security makes sense. Houston has locked up its young players under general manager Rafael Stone, so expect the Rockets to continue to do so. -- Bontemps Bennedict Mathurin , Indiana Pacers Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said over the summer that Bennedict Mathurin, above, was going to be a starter with Tyrese Haliburton out for the season. Trevor Ruszkowski-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said over the summer that Mathurin, the first single-digit draft pick the Pacers have had in a couple of generations, was going to be a starter with Tyrese Haliburton out for the season. For a team that tends to keep its talent in-house, getting a deal done with Mathurin could make sense. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Mathurin's minutes and production should increase this season with Haliburton out. But can Indiana afford to pay the wing starter money when $80 million is already committed to Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell next season? Mathurin came off the bench in 60% of games played in the past three seasons. An extension would also put Indiana over the luxury tax and near the first apron in 2026-27. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $68 million. Mathurin's production over the past three years should warrant an extension that pays an average of $17 million. The wing is one of four players of his draft class to score at least 3,000 points and he averaged 16 points for a second time in his three seasons in 2024-25, while leading all reserves in postseason points. But as we mentioned above, playing time next season and the Pacers' payroll have to be taken into consideration. -- Marks Will it happen?: This one feels unlikely. Indiana, a team that hasn't paid the luxury tax in decades, already has $160 million committed to seven players next season -- leaving the Pacers with about $40 million to fill out the roster below the luxury tax, and without a clear starting center among the players currently under contract. Getting something done that Mathurin would accept now feels too rich for the Pacers within those constraints. -- Bontemps Mark Williams , Phoenix Suns Why an extension could get done: Phoenix has already shown a commitment to Williams by sending out two first-round picks -- the No. 29 pick this past June, plus a 2029 first-rounder -- to get him from the Charlotte Hornets . So, with that investment already in the bag, getting Williams on a long-term contract with the franchise would make some sense. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Williams' health might be the most scrutinized in the NBA. The Lakers traded for Williams in February, only for him to fail his physical. After the trade was rescinded, Williams averaged 28.6 minutes, 15.1 points, 10.7 rebounds and a career high 1.3 blocks. He has never played more than 45 games in any season and has missed 116 games with various injuries (back, left foot and thumb). A likely approach is to evaluate Williams this season and then engage in contracts next summer when he is a restricted free agent. -- Marks What I would offer: A three-year, $51 million extension. The contract would be a flat $17 million per season and include exhibit 3 (prior injury exclusion that protects the Suns if Williams has a foot or back injury). The last year of the contract would be non-guaranteed but would have a minutes clause that partially or fully protects the salary. For example, if Williams plays in 55 games in 2025-26, 2026-27 and 2027-28, the contract would be fully guaranteed. If Williams reaches the criteria in one of the next three seasons, the protection would increase from zero to $5.66 million. -- Marks Will it happen?: It's hard to see it happening, even with the investment in draft capital the Suns put in to get Williams. He's a talented lob catcher, but since he's already dealing with injury issues out of the gate and has played in only 106 games in his career, this seems as if it will be a wait-and-see situation. -- Bontemps Shaedon Sharpe , Portland Trail Blazers Guard Shaedon Sharpe is a 6-foot-6 multifaceted wing who averaged 18.5 points last season. Troy Wayrynen-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Sharpe was general manager Joe Cronin's first draft pick in 2022, and will play this season -- his fourth in the NBA -- at just 22 years old. He's also a 6-foot-6 multifaceted wing who averaged 18.5 points last season. Add that up, and it's easy to see why Portland would want to keep him as part of its program moving forward. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Cap flexibility next offseason. Even after trading for Jrue Holiday and then signing Damian Lillard , Portland has $129 million in salary. The salary cap is projected to be $166 million. But Sharpe has a $25.2 million cap hold as a free agent, meaning Portland is already over the cap. The Blazers would have to let Sharpe walk in free agency to free up room. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $105 million. The contract seems rich, but I am betting on Sharpe's upside. In his first two seasons combined, he scored 1,299 points, and scored 1,335 points last season. He became the first Trail Blazer to have seven career 30-point games before turning 22. The contract would start at $29 million and then decline each season, with the last year being $23.5 million. The Trail Blazers would be $40 million below the luxury tax, leaving them enough room to sign Toumani Camara to a contract and also have access to the non-tax midlevel exception. -- Marks Will it happen?: The bet here is this one gets done. The Blazers have added veterans to augment their young core, but Portland has expressed a belief that it can build upon its strong second half from last season. Keeping Sharpe and building on that momentum moving forward is part of that plan. -- Bontemps Walker Kessler , Utah Jazz Getting Walker Kessler’s extension done would ensure Utah’s rebuild would be anchored by a player who has shown dominant rim protection prowess under coach Will Hardy. Rob Gray-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Getting Kessler's extension done would allow the president of basketball operations, Austin Ainge, to ink a player who was a key part of the Rudy Gobert trade three years ago and keep him with the franchise through the end of the decade. It would also ensure Utah's rebuild would be anchored by a player who has shown dominant rim protection prowess under coach Will Hardy. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Getting selected outside of the lottery and then outplaying your first-round contract comes with a downside. Because Kessler was selected with the 22nd pick in 2022, his free agent cap hold next season is a modest $14.7 million. That means if the Jazz signed Kessler to a starting salary of $25 million for next season, they would then lose $10 million in cap flexibility. Including the Kessler hold, Utah projects to have a minimum of $50 million in room. -- Marks What I would offer: Five years, $116 million. The extension would be a win-win for both sides. For Kessler, the $20 million starting salary next season ranks in the top 15 among all centers. The Jazz, on the other hand, would lose only $4 million in cap flexibility next summer. -- Marks Will it happen?: This one is unlikely. Both sides have signaled it won't happen, and Kessler's low cap hold for next summer without an extension will make him a valuable trade option or a valuable player for the Jazz to retain and build around as they begin to move into the next phase of their rebuild under Ainge. -- Bontemps"}

(1:33) We're a week away from opening tipoff for the 2025-26 NBA season with a few familiar faces and some new ones ready to take the court starting Oct. 21. Victor Wembanyama will be back and healthy to start the season after being shut down last February because of a blood clot in his right shoulder. And Zion Williamson will be back after playing in only 30 games last season for the New Orleans Pelicans because of various injuries. But you'll have to wait to see a few notable superstars debut this season. Los Angeles Lakers front man LeBron James is expected to sit out three to four weeks, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Plus, Kyrie Irving appears to be working his way back from his season-ending ACL tear last March. Before we get caught up in the whirlwind of the regular season, our NBA insiders provide updates on the injury status of key players and break down who is primed to make a notable return during opening week and who to keep an eye on as the regular season progresses. Zion Williamson , F, New Orleans Pelicans There was skinny Jokic. Then skinny Doncic dazzled on the cover of Men's Health. Now it's skinny Zion who has many buzzing about the Pelicans this season, as he appears to be in his best shape since looking like a once-in-a-generation prospect at Duke. Williamson credits Daniel Bove, the Pelicans' director of performance and sports science, for helping him transform his body through boxing and working out on a football field while rehabbing from a hamstring injury that plagued him all last season. In six seasons in the league, Williamson has played 60 or more games only twice and was shut down last season in March after dealing with a bone bruise , having played only 30 games. \"I really felt a shift in my body to where I would look at [Bove] and say, 'Dude, it feels good to feel good.' I haven't felt like this since college, high school, where I can walk into a gym, I feel good.\" -- Ohm Youngmisuk Anthony Davis , F, Dallas Mavericks Davis was fully cleared weeks before training camp, having recovered from offseason surgery to repair a detached retina in his right eye . He will spend the preseason getting used to the protective glasses he'll have to wear the rest of his career, per doctor's orders, as well as shedding the 15 extra pounds he carried into training camp. The 6-foot-10 Davis, now listed at 268 pounds, downplayed any worries about his weight, saying it's normal for him to report to camp a little heavy. \"I never want to come in at my playing weight, because then I lose weight during the season and then I'm too small,\" Davis said. \"I lose about 10 to 12 pounds very quickly. ... So I'm never concerned about that. I feel great. I'm moving great. I feel good.\" -- Tim MacMahon Kristaps Porzingis , C, Atlanta Hawks Porzingis has a new home in Atlanta and the center, after dealing with a mysterious ailment that allowed him to play over 20 minutes in only one of his final six games with the Boston Celtics , says he's feeling good again. \"Honestly, I still don't have an exact answer,\" Porzingis said at Hawks media day when asked about what was bothering him. \"They had some sort of explanation for it, but it was lingering. That was the toughest part. Some days I was OK, energy was good and some days, boom, I had a crash. I'm glad it's gone now.\" Porzingis played for the Latvia national team at EuroBasket this past summer and the center said the tournament helped him get back into shape for the upcoming season. The Hawks will need a healthy Porzingis to stretch the floor and provide a defensive presence at the rim for Trae Young and the Hawks to contend in the East. \"I don't know, maybe it was just my system needed some reset during the summer,\" Porzingis said. \"I was really happy I had this summer, got in shape, played the tournament, I felt confident again like I have the gas tank again.\" -- Youngmisuk LaMelo Ball , G, Charlotte Hornets Ball spent time in the weight room this offseason to get stronger. After playing in a total of 105 games over the past three seasons combined because of injuries -- most recently being shut down last season to have surgery on his ankle and wrist -- Ball is determined to stay on the court. So far this preseason, coach Charles Lee and Ball have talked about the star point guard stepping up and leading the Hornets more this season. Lee said he has seen his point guard show some of his leadership in the weight room by adding muscle.

For more information, click here . \"I've noticed a different commitment level in that area,\" Lee said at Hornets media day. \"Melo noticed that he is always drawing the best, most physical defender. At times, they made it difficult on him. \"So this year, adding that weight room piece for him was really important. ... I think he has increased his lean muscle mass, he has increased his weight.\" -- Youngmisuk Victor Wembanyama , C, San Antonio Spurs Wembanyama was limited to 46 games last season because of right shoulder deep vein thrombosis. It motivated him to push himself physically and mentally this offseason in ways he has never experienced. He approached the offseason looking to try unconventional training methods , such as a 10-day retreat at a Shaolin temple in China, replete with meditation and kung fu training, and spent time working with Houston Rockets icon Hakeem Olajuwon . Early returns look promising. He has bullied defenders in the preseason and swatted shots from all over the court. Wembanyama is fully healthy and has improved his body control, adding upper- and lower-body strength. And according to the 21-year-old, the chances for a recurrence of DVT are very low. -- Michael C. Wright Tyrese Maxey , G, Philadelphia 76ers After sitting out the final few weeks of last season because of a finger injury -- one of many maladies during a season that, even by 76ers standards, felt particularly cursed -- Maxey is healthy and ready to go for the start of this season. He played in the two exhibition games in Abu Dhabi last week and is on track to begin the season as the starting point guard. Given the number of other injuries Philadelphia is already dealing with, the fact that Maxey is ready to go will be music to the ears of coach Nick Nurse. -- Tim Bontemps Ja Morant , G, Memphis Grizzlies Morant's goal to \"play 82,\" as he stated at media day, is already in jeopardy. He's considered week-to-week after spraining his left ankle during practice the day before the Grizzlies' preseason opener. Morant's acrobatic game makes durability an issue for the star guard. That's why Morant, whose popularity is fueled by his high-flying highlights, declared last season that he is \"not trying to dunk at all,\" prioritizing protecting himself over entertaining fans. Since serving a 25-game suspension to start the 2023-24 season, Morant has played in only 59 games. He has been sidelined during that stretch by a variety of injuries -- shoulder, hip, thigh, knee, back, foot, hamstring and ankle. -- MacMahon Jaren Jackson Jr ., F, Memphis Grizzlies • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Jackson's availability for the Oct. 22 season opener is in doubt as he works his way back from an early July surgery to repair a turf toe injury in his right foot. The Grizzlies announced entering training camp that Jackson would be able to return to play in four to six weeks, putting the two-time All-Star's timetable in late October or early November. The surgery occurred a couple of days after Jackson officially agreed to a five-year, $240 million contract extension, but the Grizzlies' front office was aware of the severity of the injury when that deal was finalized. -- MacMahon LeBron James , F, Los Angeles Lakers James will make history whenever he appears in his first game this season, becoming the only NBA player to have played 23 seasons. But for the first time in his career, James is injured before the season opener, ending his streak of playing in Game No. 1 for 22 straight years. James is dealing with sciatica down the right side of his body, according to the Lakers, and won't be reevaluated for another two to three weeks and has been limited to light shooting in training camp thus far, sitting out every practice and preseason game. James hinted at the injury -- which was sustained sometime in late July or early August during an on-court workout, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania -- during the team's media day when he told ESPN, \"I'm not where I want to be [physically].\" James also said he would be sure to stay connected to the team while he rehabilitated. \"My presence is going to be important,\" James told ESPN. \"Making sure that even if I'm not on the floor, I'm always in tune to what we're doing -- so I know what's going on at all times.\" -- Dave McMenamin Zach Edey , C, Memphis Grizzlies Edey sit out at least the first two weeks of the season while recovering from offseason ankle surgery, according to the timetable the Grizzlies announced entering training camp. At the time, the team said that Edey could return to play in six to nine weeks. The longer end of that timetable would be the final weekend of November. Backup center Brandon Clarke also will sit out time to start the season while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery, so the Grizzlies will have a glaring lack of depth in the frontcourt. Memphis will have to rely heavily on journeyman Jock Landale , an offseason addition who has averaged 12.8 minutes while playing for three teams in his four-year NBA career. -- MacMahon Jalen Williams , F, Oklahoma City Thunder Williams initially suffered a fairly severe wrist injury -- a torn scapholunate ligament -- late in the regular season while grappling for a loose ball with Devin Booker in Phoenix. He played through it, estimating he needed nearly 30 painkilling shots during the Thunder's run to the title. That delayed surgery until July 1, attached to a 12-week reevaluation clock, which expired right before training camp. The team hasn't officially ruled Williams in or out for the regular-season opener, but he hasn't been in the contact portions of practice and has been spotted working only individually on the side, predominantly using his left hand. \"Still got some ways to go with it,\" Williams said at media day. -- Anthony Slater Shams Charania explains the significance of the Thunder locking up their core after Jalen Williams' extension. Jared McCain , G, Philadelphia 76ers Last season, McCain was well on his way to winning the league's Rookie of the Year award when he suffered a meniscus injury that cut things short after only 23 games last December -- adding to the injury bug that plagued Philadelphia last season. But while McCain is fully healed from that injury, he tore a tendon in his right (shooting) thumb that required surgery last month, an issue that will cost him time at the start of the regular season. Though the 76ers have plenty of guard depth, they also want to get McCain on the court with both Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe , the No. 3 pick in the June draft. -- Bontemps De'Aaron Fox , G, San Antonio Spurs Last March, Fox opted to undergo season-ending surgery to repair tendon damage in his left pinkie finger and recovered just fine from that setback, only to suffer a strained right hamstring during a summer workout that leaves in question his availability for San Antonio's Oct. 22 season opener at Dallas. Fox acknowledged he would sit out the preseason while expressing doubt he'd be ready to play in the opener. But internally, the team has been encouraged by Fox's progress. It's worth noting that San Antonio traditionally errs on the side of caution when bringing players back from injuries. It certainly helps that the roster features a glut of guards that includes last season's NBA Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and No. 2 pick Dylan Harper . -- Wright Dejounte Murray , G, New Orleans Pelicans Murray has spent six days a week in the training room, rehabbing and working his way back from a ruptured right Achilles tendon suffered at the end of January, and could be back this January. The point guard is eager to return after his first season in New Orleans was limited to only 31 games, as he was also hampered by a broken hand. Murray averaged 17.5 points, 7.4 assists, 6.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals after coming in a trade from Atlanta. \"I've been having fun seeing the progression, knowing that day it all happened, I just couldn't walk and couldn't feel my calf. It was a challenge and I accepted it.\" -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid , C, Philadelphia 76ers In a familiar feeling for the 76ers and their fans -- most unfortunately -- there is no bigger health question in the league than Embiid, and specifically his troublesome left knee. For more than a calendar year, it has been unclear when, or if, Embiid is going to be right again, and he reiterated that at media day last month. \"I've had so many injuries,\" Embiid said. \"The only thing I've always told myself is you can't give up.\" Though both Embiid and the 76ers are not giving up on the superstar center returning to the dominant form that led to winning the league's MVP award for the 2023 season, it remains unclear when he will be back on the court, be it at the start of the season or sometime after that. -- Bontemps Shams Charania joins \"NBA Today\" to explain why there is no set timeline for Joel Embiid to return from injury. Darius Garland , G, Cleveland Cavaliers After his postseason was affected by a turf toe injury, Garland opted to have surgery in June, one that is likely to sideline him for the first few weeks of the regular season. Garland said at media day last week that his recovery is on schedule and that he's running and doing on-court work. He remains out of participating with the team in practices to start the preseason, and isn't expected to be ready to play in any exhibition games. But Cleveland has made it clear that it isn't going to rush Garland back -- given the Cavaliers are hoping to be playing into June, and need Garland at 100% to do that. -- Bontemps Paul George , F, Philadelphia 76ers George's status for the start of the season remains unclear after it was announced he'd undergone an arthroscopic surgery after suffering an injury in an offseason workout -- an ominous sign after only playing in half the games in his first season in 2024-25. George, who has done some on-court work, said, \"I do think I will be at a good place, hopefully earlier than later. Can't get any worse than last year. That was a rock-bottom type of season.\" We'll see if last season was, in fact, as bad as it can get, but the 76ers will be hoping George can be back either by opening night or soon thereafter. -- Bontemps Kyrie Irving , G, Dallas Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd went out of his way to push back against the perception that Irving is \"ahead of schedule\" in his recovery from a torn ACL suffered in early March. But Irving's progress is evident, and he hasn't been shy about putting the proof on display with his post-practice work during media access periods. Irving isn't only taking spot-up jump shots. He's working on his legendary isolation game, making one- and two-dribble moves against the defense of a team staffer. He often takes turns with No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg during these sessions, helping teach the 18-year-old rookie some tricks of the trade. When will Irving join Flagg in game action? Irving, 33, doesn't want to set a specific target date, preferring to pour himself into the daily grind. The Mavs would be happy to have Irving back in the mix around the All-Star break, which would give him about two months to chip off rust and ramp up before the postseason. -- MacMahon Mavs coach Jason Kidd dismisses reports that Kyrie Irving is ahead of schedule in his recovery. Lauri Markkanen , F, Utah Jazz A variety of injuries, most notably a lower-back issue, limited Markkanen last season to a career-low 47 games. But he bounced back over the summer and looked healthy, leading Finland to the bronze medal game at EuroBasket with a 29-point performance that included 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in an upset win over Nikola Jokic and Serbia. Markkanen sustained a left wrist bruise during the tournament, which forced him out of preseason games and has limited him for a good portion of the team's training camp. Markkanen said he's rehabbing daily, feeling better, and making progress, but added he's \"not sure of what the exact date is when I'm gonna start\" playing again. -- Wright"}

And, despite the scrutiny it might create, that means deepening relations with Abu Dhabi and its wealthy neighbors.", "body": "ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -- It's a few minutes before tipoff in the first NBA game of any sort in the 2025-26 season and the basketball court inside Etihad Arena is overflowing with training camp-sized rosters of Knicks and 76ers players and officials. On the sideline, Patrick Ewing is shaking hands with a man from Beirut who is wearing a vintage No. 33 Knicks jersey. Derrick Rose, who was flown in for the event, is posing for photos with a group of Filipino fans. Steve Harvey and Patrick Schwarzenegger, among other invited celebrities, are being escorted to courtside seats. Throughout the crowd, many Emirati men are wearing kanduras, traditional ankle-length white robes, but they are vastly outnumbered by ex-pats from dozens of other countries, including a teenager from Riyadh a few rows behind the 76ers bench, wearing an Anthony Edwards Team USA jersey and a pair of the newest version of Edwards' Adidas signature shoes, which technically hadn't even been released yet. But perhaps the most interesting interaction taking place is between two Americans. Next to the team benches are two of the most powerful men in the NBA, Knicks owner James Dolan and commissioner Adam Silver, laughing and chatting, warmly embracing the evening together despite years of frosty relations . Standing between Dolan and Silver is the man who brought them together: His Excellency Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, who has spent the past decade developing relationships and directing growing investment dollars to bring top stakeholders in the sport to Abu Dhabi. That Silver and Dolan are aligned on their partnerships with Al Mubarak is one of the signs that the future of global basketball is being brokered now amid the giant cranes and rising cities in the Middle East. Despite their differences at home, Dolan and Silver are united in knowing this is a vitally important relationship to nurture. International basketball is on the cusp of a new, richer and expansive era that is aiming to deliver more of the sport to underserved fans and -- perhaps more importantly -- capture vast sovereign wealth fund capital that is seeking a place to invest in the sport. Some legacy leagues are in danger of being left behind. Some new leagues are trying to rise up. The NBA is focused on defending and strengthening its position as the biggest dog. And, despite the scrutiny it might create , that means deepening relations with Abu Dhabi and its wealthy neighbors. \"WHEN I CLOSE my eyes, I can see an NBA game being played in front of 22,500 people at the Sphere,\" Al Mubarak says as he leans back in a chair in a glittering building on the expansive NYU Abu Dhabi campus. He's not talking about Las Vegas. \"We will have the world's greatest technology where we can immerse the fans in the experience and they can feel the game on a new level.\" Al Mubarak, or \"the chairman\" as he is often referred to by colleagues in his various cultural and leadership positions in Abu Dhabi, has engineered partnerships with the likes of Pope Francis, renowned architect Frank Gehry and UFC CEO Dana White. But he loves American sports and is an active NBA fan. \"I have some mixed feelings on the [Luka] Doncic trade,\" Al Mubarak says, referencing his favorite team, the Lakers. \"I am a believer in the importance of the traditional big man and Anthony Davis was such a part of the [2020] championship. But I know that Luka is motivated and he is one of the most talented players in the game.\" Over the summer, the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) Abu Dhabi, of which Al Mubarak is the chairman, finalized a massive deal with Dolan's Sphere Entertainment to construct and operate a new venue in the UAE, with rights to build more in the Middle East and North Africa over the next 10 years. The original Sphere, which opened in Las Vegas in 2023, cost Dolan's company $2.3 billion to construct and has since lost more than $1 billion, according to its public financial disclosures. Dolan declined to comment for this story. Dolan turned to Abu Dhabi, where he found willing partners, both in the Sphere and in the Knicks, after a six-year effort to build a second Sphere in London failed in 2024 amid a tangle of red tape and political pushback. Last season Abu Dhabi's tourism arm, Experience Abu Dhabi, became the Knicks jersey-patch sponsor in a multiyear lucrative deal, but that was an appetizer to the Sphere partnership that came later. More NBA-linked deals are in the works in Abu Dhabi. This fall, the NBA is expected to finalize a long-term extension of its relationship with the DCT that will guarantee annual preseason games in Abu Dhabi and establish a new NBA Global Academy at NYU's Abu Dhabi campus, where top prospects from around the world will be sent to live, get an education and develop their games. The deal is expected to last well into the next decade, sources told ESPN. It is also a precursor to another large and potentially pivotal deal. The NBA is in discussions with Al Mubarak and other leaders about investing in NBA Europe, which has emerged as a league priority over the past year. In what could prove to be a signature move of Silver's tenure, the NBA is investigating launching a new NBA-branded European league as early as 2027, with a mix of existing teams recruited away from other leagues and expansion. Abu Dhabi is considering the possible launch of a team in Manchester, where they have owned and turned Manchester City Football Club into a global leader in soccer with world-class infrastructure. \"It is a possibility,\" Al Mubarak said of investing in an expansion team in NBA Europe. \"The NBA is the world's best basketball league and we have a deep commitment and track record of success in the [Manchester] community.\" The NBA is seeding the ground ahead of the potential investment in Manchester. Last summer, the league conducted its first-ever Basketball Without Borders event in the United Kingdom by bringing top teen boys and girls to Manchester. In the 2026-27 season, the league is exploring bringing NBA teams to play at least one game in Manchester, sources told ESPN. Silver and deputy commissioner Mark Tatum traveled to London and Paris over the summer for meetings about placing teams in both cities. They also met with leadership from Real Madrid about recruiting the legacy team to the NBA Europe league. In August, NBA Hall of Famer Tony Parker, who owns ASVEL, a team based near Lyon, France, indicated his interest in jumping to the new league by telling reporters: \"NBA Europe league for me is just a matter of time. They are coming, and it's going to happen.\" In recent weeks, leadership in legacy European teams Alba Berlin in Germany and Galatasaray, a large multisport conglomerate in Istanbul, have confirmed publicly their interest in NBA Europe. But having Abu Dhabi invest, be it in Manchester or elsewhere, is a huge boost for the concept. And with a potential expansion fee in the hundreds of millions to join the league, it could set an important standard for other investors as the new league establishes its footing. \"They are the lead investors in Manchester City. And they've had tremendous success there. They've demonstrated they are innovators in sport. They've demonstrated that they're in it for the long term, that they're not just financial investors, that they're active participants,\" Silver said as he stood with Tatum and George Aivazoglou, the NBA's head of Europe and the Middle East, all of whom came to Abu Dhabi to continue discussions about the future. \"So they are dream investors.\" • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Such foreign investment -- across many industries -- has sometimes drawn criticism. The NBA is far from alone among high-profile American companies with ties to Abu Dhabi, including Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., the Cleveland Clinic and ESPN parent company Disney, which earlier this year announced a partnership with Abu Dhabi for a theme park not far from where the new Sphere will be constructed. The NBA, for its part, has previously faced concern about partnerships with countries and leaders whose values don't necessarily align with those publicly supported by the league itself . In launching its Basketball Africa League in 2021, the NBA came under congressional scrutiny for partnering with Rwandan dictator Paul Kagame . Earlier this year, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo called for the NBA and other international sports leagues and teams to sever ties with Rwanda and questioned whether the NBA's \"commitment to social justice and respect for human rights\" aligns with its business ties to Rwanda. Last year, as the NBA's ties with Abu Dhabi deepened, Human Rights Watch issued a warning , saying, in part: \"The NBA should be aware that the U.A.E. hosts high profile sporting, entertainment, and cultural events to promote a public image of openness and tolerance at odds with the government's rampant systemic human rights violations.\" These include what HRW calls unequal rights for women. The NBA has responded to these claims in the past by saying the league follows \"the lead of the U.S. government as to where it's appropriate to engage in business around the world,\" as deputy commissioner Tatum said in a letter to U.S. senators last year. Through the building of courts and investments in new programs, the NBA has fostered growth in basketball in Rwanda , including for many women. The NBA also has championed the Middle East partnerships' effect on basketball participation in the region, citing studies that show a 400% increase in participation in the UAE and 50% in the Middle East over the past five years among boys and girls. Formula 1, the European Tour and WTA Tour also have long-standing relationships with and hold major events in Abu Dhabi. \"I think that what we share with the leaders [in Abu Dhabi] is this belief in the power of sport, and that as we look around the world, very few things that create commonality, empathy, understanding in the way sport does,\" Silver told ESPN. \"For example, I think many people outside the region might be surprised to see that there are an equal number of girls and boys in the youth programs here. And that there are universal values that are being taught in terms of respect, discipline, hard work, teamwork, understanding -- all fundamental values that we share. And at a time when so much divides us, it's nice to be focused on things that bring us together.\" TWO NIGHTS BEFORE the NBA opened its season in Abu Dhabi, a seminal event took place 75 miles down the E11 highway, in the sprawling metropolis of Dubai. There, two-year-old Dubai Basketball hosted its first-ever EuroLeague game against Serbian basketball power KK Partizan at the modern Coca-Cola Arena. The EuroLeague, the most competitive league in the world outside the NBA, is facing an uncertain future with NBA Europe looming and threatening its markets. In response, the EuroLeague took the extraordinary step of giving the brand-new Dubai team a five-year wild-card berth into the league. The deal, according to reports in Europe, includes covering the traveling expenses of European teams that will fly up to seven hours for the away games. Bringing major Western sporting events to the UAE is a goal of all this investment. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now After 15 years as title sponsor of the EuroLeague, Turkish Airlines was replaced this season by Abu Dhabi-owned Etihad Airlines on a four-year deal that will assist in the travel. Emirates Airline, the Dubai-owed rival of Etihad, signed a long-term deal with the NBA in 2024 to become the title sponsor of the NBA Cup. Still, the league doesn't currently have plans to base an NBA Europe team in the Middle East and playing the NBA Cup final in Dubai isn't under consideration, Silver told ESPN. Recently, the league announced changes to the NBA Cup schedule, including moving the semifinals to home team markets from Las Vegas starting in 2026, with the final at a neutral site. Last spring, the EuroLeague held its final four in Abu Dhabi, another deal put together by Al Mubarak, to sold out crowds, the first time the event had ever been held outside Europe. The future of European basketball, it is increasingly clear, runs through the UAE. LAST APRIL, IN a news release that made some noise in the private equity world, TWG Global announced a $10 billion investment from Mubadala Capital with the proceeds \"to be used by TWG to capitalize on its attractive set of proprietary investment opportunities.\" TWG Global is the holding company for the investments of Los Angeles businessman Mark Walter and his partners. Mubadala Capital is the asset management wing of Abu Dhabi's largest sovereign wealth fund. Two months later, this development contributed to enormous noise in the sports world when Walter, via TWG Global, agreed to buy the controlling share of the Los Angeles Lakers for a $10 billion valuation. The future of the NBA's most prized franchise, it seems, is also linked to the UAE. The Middle East interest in new basketball ventures goes deeper. Two years ago, the Qatar Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of the wealthy Gulf nation, bought 5% of the Washington Wizards' parent company. That same year, Qatar won a bid to host the 2027 FIBA World Cup. The fund is also the controlling owner of European soccer power Paris Saint-Germain, which in March 2025 confirmed it had been in talks regarding NBA Europe. Like Abu Dhabi with its Manchester City property, PSG could launch an expansion team under the same brand and act as an anchor tenant. Over the summer, in a move that could ultimately dovetail with such an eventual basketball investment, PSG made a landmark agreement to expand a partnership with NBA superstar Kevin Durant in which Durant got a small ownership stake in PSG. \"This club has big plans ahead and I can't wait to be a part of the next phase of growth,\" Durant said at the time. \"And to explore new investment opportunities with [Qatar].\" There are other ventures also seeking investment from Middle East sources. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now In February, the Financial Times reported the sovereign wealth funds of both Singapore and Saudi Arabia were among the potential backers behind a new global circuit basketball league. In the months since, the extent of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund's (PIF) proposed involvement in the new basketball league has not been formally made public. Sela, a Saudi events company owned by the PIF, did confirm its involvement with the startup league. Multiple player agents, current and former league executives and support staffers told ESPN they'd been recruited to join the league ahead of a possible 2026 launch and, in some cases, were required to sign NDAs. At times, this recruitment involved superstar LeBron James' longtime business partner Maverick Carter, who worked as an adviser to the league for months. Last week, Carter confirmed to ESPN he had left the venture, which calls itself Project B and its representatives said in media interviews it is now focusing on starting a women's basketball league to rival the WNBA. The PIF and Sela did not respond to requests for comment on their level of involvement. A spokesperson for Swiss banking giant UBS, which announced it was advising the startup league earlier this year, declined to comment on its current relationship with the project but confirmed the fledgling league was still a client. James' representatives, including agent Rich Paul, told ESPN that James himself was not connected to the venture. James has developed a relationship with Saudi Arabian leaders and the PIF over the past few years, though. James held a clinic at Al-Azem Academy in Riyadh in 2023 as a guest of Saudi Minister of Culture Bader bin Farhan Al Saud. Last January, James became a team owner in E1, a global electric boat racing circuit that was launched by the PIF. Tom Brady and Rafael Nadal are also affiliated with teams in E1. At a recent conference hosted by Front Office Sports, Silver said he was not following those developments, but added: \"Competition is good. It keeps everyone on their toes.\" Silver, however, is focused on his Middle East partners in Abu Dhabi. How and where all the money might flow and the impact it could have remains to be seen. But what is known is that the connection between the NBA and the Middle East is real, and an expansion of the relationship is coming, and the league is shoring up support with rivals, both seen and unseen, across the region. \"We are thinking about the long term, not just the next couple of years,\" Al Mubarak said. \"I believe that this partnership with the NBA will outlive me.\" ESPN's Ramona Shelburne contributed to this story."}

Here are the most noteworthy storylines from 14 of the league's most intriguing teams.", "body": "The NBA's preseason is drawing to a close The curtain will rise on the 2025-26 season in Oklahoma City on Tuesday, when the defending champion Thunder will celebrate their first title as they host former Thunder star Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets . And while much of the preseason is about rounding into shape and getting to the start of the season healthy, there are still things that can be gleaned from the early October action. To take stock of where things sit after most of the exhibition slate has been played, our NBA reporters -- Tim Bontemps, Jamal Collier, Vince Goodwill, Baxter Holmes, Tim MacMahon, Dave McMenamin, Anthony Slater, Michael C. Wright and Ohm Youngmisuk -- provided their takeaways on several contenders from each conference, and what each franchise looks like heading into the upcoming season. Jump to a team: ATL | CLE | DAL DET | GSW | HOU LAC | LAL | MIL NYK | OKC | ORL PHI | SAS Charles Barkley weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Bucks after Milwaukee had trade conversations with the Knicks earlier in the offseason. One of the early observations made by players during the first days of Hawks camp was that everyone was on the court, and the trainer's room was empty. The Hawks are healthy and buzzing over new additions Kristaps Porzingis , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard . Being healthy again is vital to the Hawks' success and growth. A huge factor for Atlanta this season is Jalen Johnson , who looked good in his first two preseason games back from left shoulder surgery that ended his 2024-25 season; Johnson made 7 of 11 shots and had 20 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in 25 minutes against Memphis. Coach Quin Snyder said Johnson's improvement on defense will be the next step for the young forward. If he can stay healthy and continue to grow as a playmaker to help Young and Porzingis, the Hawks could really take off this season. -- Youngmisuk The Cavaliers have a lot of depth, and they will need it. Max Strus is likely out for a few months with a Jones fracture in his left foot. Darius Garland will miss the opening weeks of the season as well after offseason turf toe surgery. New addition Lonzo Ball is not going to play back-to-backs, and he played 35 games last season for the Chicago Bulls after missing the prior two seasons with injuries. De'Andre Hunter has never played more than 67 games and has missed at least 25 games in three of his six seasons. And Dean Wade has eclipsed 60 games in only one of his six seasons. So while Cleveland feels good about where it sits after claiming the top seed in the East last season, it is already navigating injuries -- and likely will be throughout this season. -- Bontemps Giving third-year forward Ausar Thompson more responsibility has come into focus. The team began to take off last season when his health restrictions (blood clot) were lifted and his two-way prowess was unleashed. Now, the Pistons view him as a secondary ball handler, initiating offense as a change-of-pace guard to contrast the more deliberate Cade Cunningham . Coach J.B. Bickerstaff noted how Thompson initiated some offense with Cunningham on the floor to present a different look. With Jaden Ivey (left fibula) still \"dealing with some discomfort,\" according to Bickerstaff, the team is bringing him along slowly, thus creating more opportunity for Thompson on offense. As for Cunningham, preseason is the smallest of sample sizes, but according to sources, \"he's proving last year wasn't a fluke.\" -- Goodwill The 18-year-old rookie scored 10 points and contributed 6 rebounds, 3 assists and a blocked shot in 14 minutes. The Giannis saga is far from over. Despite attempts from the Bucks to quell speculation over Antetokounmpo 's future since the start of camp, the two-time MVP has simultaneously emphasized his current commitment to the Bucks while leaving the door open that he could continue his career elsewhere . Antetokounmpo has doubled down on his desire to compete for championships with an unwillingness to accept anything less. It has put the pressure on the Bucks this season to prove he can win another championship in Milwaukee. For a team that has lost in the first round in three consecutive seasons, not advancing further in the playoffs could lead to a day of reckoning. -- Collier Off the floor, the Antetokounmpo situation will hang over the team all season following the revelation that the Knicks and Bucks discussed a potential trade of the power forward this offseason. Several key players will be on notice and have an eye on what's going on with Milwaukee to track Antetokounmpo's frame of mind. On the floor, the Knicks want to play faster on offense and shoot more 3s, but it has been a work in progress through four preseason games. The Knicks have a favorable schedule to start the season, which should provide an early window into how the Mike Brown era will look in New York. -- Goodwill The Magic are getting healthier, and that is a big deal. Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner started camp healthy after both dealt with oblique injuries last season; they missed a combined total of 58 regular-season games. Orlando isn't whole yet, though. Guard Jalen Suggs is still slowly making his way back from left knee surgery and Mo Wagner remains out with a torn left ACL sustained in December 2024. In the meantime, Banchero, Wagner and the rest of the Magic will try to develop chemistry as quickly as possible with new addition Desmond Bane while hoping to drastically improve on their league-worst 31.8% 3-point shooting last season. The Magic have started out camp playing faster, focusing on getting out in transition and using defense to create offense. Through the first three preseason games, the Magic averaged 104 possessions. They averaged a league-low 96.5 last season. The most important thing will be going into the season with Banchero, Wagner and Bane healthy and hoping Suggs can add to the team once he is ready. -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid might be healthy? That feels strange to say after everything that has happened over the past 18 months, but so far it has been a relatively stress-free preseason in Philadelphia. Embiid appears on track to be ready for the 76ers' opener against the rival Celtics on Oct. 22. Anyone who has followed Embiid's tenure in Philadelphia knows how quickly things can change, and he has had enough issues with his left knee that it's fair to wonder how long it will last until another flareup. Embiid said at the start of training camp they're just taking things day-by-day. But unlike last year, when his preseason was a waiting game to see when his knee would be ready to go, Embiid has practiced regularly, participated in Sunday's open scrimmage and is expected to play Friday against Minnesota in Philadelphia's preseason finale. -- Bontemps Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The mantra of Dallas GM Nico Harrison is \" defense wins championships ,\" but the Mavericks have some things to figure out on that end of the floor, particularly on the perimeter. Coach Jason Kidd said he has to \"continue to look at different combinations to see what gives us the best way to start the game\" after the Hornets scored 95 points through three quarters as the Mavs played their starters into the second half. Klay Thompson was tasked with being the primary defender on Charlotte star LaMelo Ball , which is probably asking too much of a 35-year-old with his injury history. The options are limited if D'Angelo Russell starts alongside Thompson. P.J. Washington typically took the toughest perimeter defensive assignment last season, but he came off the bench in the first two preseason games. Would the Mavs be better off starting Washington with 18-year-old Cooper Flagg as the primary offensive initiator? That's the look Kidd went with against the Utah Jazz on Monday, when Russell rested. -- MacMahon The headliners aren't showing any alarming signs of age at the moment. Al Horford has fit the culture and system well so far. One of the leftover questions is how exactly Steve Kerr will deploy his starting lineup around Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . Horford will start at center on some nights, but Kerr said he wants to be careful considering Horford's age and the need to limit his minutes. \"If Al were a little younger, he'd be in the starting lineup for sure,\" Kerr said. Kerr has hinted that he might employ a small-ball unit that includes Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski . But Moody hurt his left calf in practice and his status is uncertain to start the season. Podziemski punctuated a great camp with a 23-point night in Los Angeles against the Lakers. Kerr wouldn't officially commit to him as the starting shooting guard, but the presumed lineup for opening night is Curry, Podziemski, Butler, Green, Horford -- though it is anticipated Kerr will change it around often. -- Slater Houston's offensive initiation by committee approach will work out just fine in the wake of veteran point guard Fred VanVleet 's season-ending injury. Rockets coach Ime Udoka often throws around the term \"KYP\" (know your personnel) in news conferences. Perhaps that intricate knowledge of Houston's roster played a major role in Udoka's confidence that his group \"can get the job done\" in VanVleet's absence. Early returns in the preseason have been promising with the Rockets utilizing multiple players -- mainly center Alperen Sengun and forward Amen Thompson -- to initiate offense. Expect Houston to also lean on Durant to facilitate the offense along with second-year guard Reed Sheppard , who appears to be growing more confident in his role. -- Wright Playing beneath the cloud of an NBA investigation -- and one centered around a team's star player -- is no small thing. But it appears the Clippers, for now, are resolved to not let that inquiry serve as a distraction. Through two preseason games, Kawhi Leonard appears in midseason form. He scored 18 points in 18 minutes in one game and 17 points in 19 minutes in the other. New acquisitions Brook Lopez and John Collins have seemed to fit in already, and Chris Paul 's reunion with the Clippers feels seamless. The Clippers boast one of the league's oldest rosters, but it's also among the deepest, which should help some of their more veteran players as the season moves along. There are a few preseason games left, not that those offer concrete evidence of the season to come, but despite the small sample size, the rebuilt Clippers appear especially promising. -- Holmes Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The extra time to practice and jell together that the team pined for after last season's abrupt first-round exit was not to be. Unfortunately, training camp didn't provide the opportunity everyone hoped for. LeBron James was limited to being a vocal participant in the Lakers' scrimmages from the sidelines because of sciatica down his right side , which also kept him out of the preseason. Luka Doncic was purposely held out of the majority of L.A.'s preseason slate and was given a modified workload for a handful of practice days, with the medical staff cognizant of his EuroBasket duty over the summer . Marcus Smart , signed in the offseason, was out with Achilles tendinopathy. Maxi Kleber , who was only healthy and available for one game after being acquired from Dallas in the Doncic trade in February, missed most of camp with a quad injury. Rookie Adou Thiero was also limited because of knee swelling. \"These are the cards we were dealt,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"I surely would like everybody to be healthy.\" -- McMenamin All-NBA wing Jalen Williams is unlikely to be ready for the start of the regular season as he continues to recover from surgery on his right wrist, an operation he had on July 1 , after playing the entire postseason with torn ligaments. \"I would have cut my right hand off to win a championship,\" Williams told ESPN. He has only recently begun to shoot with his right hand again and has yet to be cleared for contact work. The Thunder and Williams have not publicly discussed a timetable for his return as they take a patient approach. \"Whenever I feel like I can be a hundred percent and do that whole thing, then I'll rock out,\" Williams said. -- MacMahon The Spurs will look different this season. Team president and former coach Gregg Popovich has always encouraged new coach Mitch Johnson to be himself. It'll be apparent on the floor this season as Johnson incorporates more of his own principles in San Antonio during his first full season on the job. Victor Wembanyama made that point clear in describing how the staff put together \"a more extended plan\" over the summer that emphasizes \"better recognition of our roles together.\" Veteran Harrison Barnes pointed out, \"We have a lot of new stuff that we're doing,\" adding, \"We've changed some of the processes of how we're doing [things]. That comes with Mitch implementing his style, which I think has been well-received by players.\" Expect the Spurs to flex their collective youth and athleticism to play a faster style. -- Wright"}

(1:30) How will the NBA season look if my stats-based projections are an accurate measure of team ability? The purpose of simulating the NBA season ahead of time is generally to see how often various things are likely to happen, from the weakest teams winning the draft lottery to the best ones taking home the Larry O'Brien Trophy. It can also be fun to go through individual runs of the simulation to give an idea of what unlikely events could become reality based on random chance. In the spirit of ESPN's NFL tradition of detailing the events of a single simulation , let's go through the NBA season using simulation No. 620 -- chosen because of its interesting outcomes -- from opening night to the end of the NBA Finals. Note, this is not my prediction (or ESPN's) of how this season will unfold. The outcomes are produced at random via simulation, and everything else, including player stats, takes creative license. Along the way, we'll crown an NBA Cup winner, enjoy the action on Christmas Day, determine the final playoff seeds, set the draft lottery and winner, run through the play-in tournament, playoffs and finally, name the 2025-26 NBA champion. Let's get to it. Oklahoma City Thunder over Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors over Los Angeles Lakers After getting their championship rings and raising the first banner in the rafters at Paycom Arena, the Thunder showed why they were favored to repeat with an impressive win during Kevin Durant 's Houston debut. Durant scored 27 points against his former team, the first day of the regular season, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams both topped 20 points and Chet Holmgren had five blocks. Later, the Warriors spoiled Luka Doncic 's first home opener with the Lakers, handing them a 107-99 defeat. Afterward, an ebullient Draymond Green vowed that the Warriors, not Oklahoma City, should be considered the title favorites. Quarterfinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (4) Detroit Pistons (2) Miami Heat over (3) Cleveland Cavaliers (4) Minnesota Timberwolves over (1) Oklahoma City Thunder (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (2) Memphis Grizzlies Semifinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (2) Miami Heat (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (4) Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Cup final (Dec. 16): (1) Boston Celtics over (3) Portland Trail Blazers The NBA Cup, running from Oct. 21 to Dec. 16, resulted in an unexpected final in Las Vegas that pitted the Celtics against former guard Jrue Holiday and the Trail Blazers. Boston, off to a 16-10 start without the injured Jayson Tatum , finished as the No. 1 seed in the East play-in and beat the Pistons at home and the Heat in the semifinals in Las Vegas. The upstart Blazers, also 16-10, took advantage of the Thunder getting upset by the Timberwolves at home during the quarterfinals. Portland also won on the road, in Memphis, and then beat Minnesota in the semifinals. Alas, the Blazers' run ended in a 115-103 loss. Portland shot 10-of-36 on 3s, while Derrick White and Payton Pritchard made four apiece for Boston, which immediately shut down talk of referring to the NBA Cup as \"Banner 19.\" Still, the Celtics were able to match the rival Lakers' inaugural NBA Cup title. Struggling teams were the storyline on Christmas Day. The Cavaliers and Knicks , who entered the season as East favorites, were 11th and seventh, respectively, going into their matchup at Madison Square Garden. The Cavaliers, buried by early-season injuries to the backcourt, got some measure of satisfaction with a win over the Knicks. There was no such relief for the Lakers, who dropped five games below .500 after losing at home to Houston. The vibes were better for the top two teams in the West, the surprising Warriors and Thunder, who both won at home. So did the Denver Nuggets behind a 30-point triple-double from Nikola Jokic . As the NBA gathered from Feb. 13 to 15 at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, the Warriors were the talk of the league. Green and Jimmy Butler III joined Steph Curry on the West roster thanks to Golden State's league-best 42-13 record at the break. In the rearview mirror of the experienced Warriors there was plenty of youth with the Thunder 4.5 games back in the West and the ascendant Magic atop the East with the NBA's second-best record. After their slow starts, the Knicks and Cavaliers had righted the ships, moving up to second and fourth in the conference, respectively. The Clippers were tied for fourth in the West, but their crosstown rivals continued to stumble. Now 12 games below .500, the Lakers were all but eliminated from the play-in race at six games back of the Sacramento Kings for 10th. LeBron James mused about taking March off to watch his son Bryce play in the NCAA tournament for the Arizona Wildcats. With less than two weeks left in the regular season, plenty remained at stake, including the top seed in the West. The Thunder had closed within 2.5 games of the still-hot Warriors. The race to avoid the play-in was hard-fought with three teams at 40 wins apiece, albeit with the Blazers two games back in the loss column of Houston and Minnesota. Two games back in the loss column for the play-in, the Mavericks were still looking to make it with Kyrie Irving 's return to the lineup. In the East, the Celtics -- who had gone just 19-30 since winning the NBA Cup -- were trying to hold off the Philadelphia 76ers and disappointing Detroit Pistons to reach the play-in. The Warriors shut down any talk of a Thunder comeback by finishing the season on a 10-game winning streak to reach 63 wins, their most since 2016-17. In the East, the Magic ran away with the top seed and finished seven games clear of the Knicks. The No. 6 seed in both conferences was decided via a tiebreaker. Cleveland, which fell back off the pace after the All-Star break, ended up in the play-in with the Milwaukee Bucks getting the No. 6 seed. Meanwhile, Houston won a tie out West, sending the Timberwolves to the play-in a year after they narrowly avoided it. Defiant, Anthony Edwards vowed Minnesota would get back to the conference finals anyway. Eastern Conference No. 7 Cleveland Cavaliers over No. 8 Miami Heat (Cleveland clinches playoffs to face No. 2 Knicks) No. 9 Chicago Bulls over No. 10 Boston Celtics (Chicago advances; Boston eliminated) No. 9 Bulls over No. 8 Heat (Chicago clinches playoffs to face No. 1 Orlando; Miami eliminated) Western Conference No. 8 Portland Trail Blazers over No. 7 Minnesota Timberwolves (Portland clinches playoffs to face No. 2 Thunder) No. 10 Sacramento Kings over No. 9 Phoenix Suns (Sacramento advances; Phoenix eliminated) No. 10 Kings over No. 7 Timberwolves (Sacramento clinches playoffs to face No. 1 Warriors; Minnesota eliminated) Consider the Chicago Bulls the big winners of the play-in tournament, a place where they've got plenty of experience. Not only did Chicago win in Miami to claim the No. 8 seed in the East playoffs, but the Bulls also landed a first-round pick when Portland capped its unexpected season by winning at the Target Center to earn the seventh spot in the West. Things went from bad to worse for the Timberwolves in the final game of the play-in tournament as the Sacramento Kings handed them a surprise 103-101 loss on a DeMar DeRozan pull-up jumper in the final five seconds. Sacramento players celebrated by donning \"Kings of the Play-in\" T-shirts, much to the Bulls' dismay. There was less drama in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers salvaged the No. 7 seed with a 31-point win over Miami reminiscent of last year's dominant first-round sweep. 1. Utah Jazz (from Minnesota Timberwolves ) 2. Atlanta Hawks (from New Orleans Pelicans ) 3. Brooklyn Nets 4. Washington Wizards 5. Minnesota Timberwolves (from Utah Jazz ) 6. Charlotte Hornets 7. Detroit Pistons 8. Dallas Mavericks 9. Los Angeles Lakers 10. Oklahoma City Thunder (from Philadelphia 76ers ) 11. San Antonio Spurs 12. Boston Celtics 13. Memphis Grizzlies (from Phoenix Suns ) 14. Miami Heat For the second consecutive year, a team eliminated on the eve of the playoffs won the NBA draft lottery. This time, the Timberwolves didn't get to enjoy it like the Mavericks did in 2025. A swap from the Rudy Gobert trade sent the top pick to the Utah Jazz, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny their interest in drafting AJ Dybantsa from nearby BYU. The news wasn't all bad for Minnesota, which swapped down only to No. 5. Meanwhile, the 34-48 Pelicans didn't benefit from jumping up to No. 2, sending that pick to the Hawks to complete their deal on 2025 draft night. The Nets and Wizards claimed the next two picks, having entered with the best odds because of their combined 25 wins. Later on, the playoff-bound Thunder and Grizzlies acquired lottery picks through trades; the Grizzlies had the opportunity to swap for the Suns' pick in the Desmond Bane trade. Speaking to reporters before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged that the league's competition committee will revisit lottery odds to avoid teams preferring the lottery to advancing through the play-in tournament. Eastern Conference Round 1 (1) Orlando Magic over (8) Chicago Bulls , 4-1 (2) New York Knicks over (7) Cleveland Cavaliers , 4-2 (3) Atlanta Hawks over (6) Milwaukee Bucks , 4-1 (5) Toronto Raptors over (4) Indiana Pacers , 4-3 Western Conference Round 1 (1) Golden State Warriors over (8) Sacramento Kings , 4-1 (2) Oklahoma City Thunder over (7) Portland Trail Blazers , 4-0 (6) Houston Rockets over (3) Denver Nuggets , 4-3 (5) LA Clippers over (4) Memphis Grizzlies , 4-2 The most anticipated first-round series -- an expected matchup between the Knicks and Cavaliers in the conference finals -- ended up fizzling. Banged up from a difficult regular season and play-in appearance, Cleveland was eliminated at home in Game 6. But there was plenty of drama elsewhere. Two road teams with less experience won their Game 7s. The Toronto Raptors held former star Pascal Siakam to 15 points on 4-of-16 shooting for their first series win since 2020, and the Rockets shocked the Nuggets in Denver thanks to 12 fourth-quarter points from Durant. Houston hadn't advanced in the playoffs since 2019. The Clippers were the other lower seed to advance, beating Memphis, which ESPN BET listed as the underdog before the series. After winning Game 1 on the road, the Clippers closed out the Grizzlies at home in six games. Eastern Conference semifinals (1) Orlando Magic over (5) Toronto Raptors , 4-2 (2) New York Knicks over (3) Atlanta Hawks , 4-1 Western Conference semifinals (1) Golden State Warriors over (5) LA Clippers , 4-2 (2) Oklahoma City Thunder over (6) Houston Rockets , 4-3 The top two seeds in both conferences advanced in Round 2. For a second consecutive year, the Thunder needed seven games to reach the conference finals, but the Rockets pushed the defending champs without injured point guard Fred VanVleet . \"We'll be back,\" Durant said in a somber Houston locker room. The Warriors beat the Clippers in a battle of the NBA's two oldest rosters, and the Magic and Knicks reminded everyone that they've been the class of the East all season. Both dropped just three total games en route to a showdown in the conference semifinals. Conference finals (1) Orlando Magic over (2) New York Knicks , 4-1 (1) Golden State Warriors over (2) Oklahoma City Thunder , 4-2 The Magic cruised to their first trip to the NBA Finals since 2009, surprising New York at Madison Square Garden in Game 3 to take a 3-0 series lead before completing the gentleman's sweep. Meanwhile, in a battle of the NBA's last dynasty against a team aspiring to become one, the Warriors lived up to Green's seasonlong hype. The teams split the first two games of the series before Golden State won the pivotal Game 5 and then closed out Oklahoma City on the road to host the NBA Finals. (1) Orlando Magic over (1) Golden State Warriors , 4-3 The Warriors' magical run to their seventh Finals in the past 12 years finally ran out of gas at home in Game 7, similar to Golden State's loss to Cleveland in 2016. With Curry playing through a minor injury by the end of the season, the Warriors' potent offense operated at less than full strength. Orlando took advantage, unexpectedly winning the first championship in franchise history barely a year after upgrading their starting lineup with Bane. Paolo Banchero completed a breakthrough campaign by scoring 32 points in Game 7 and being named Finals MVP. He split votes with Franz Wagner , who averaged 22 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in the series while defending Butler. Interviewed on the podium by Lisa Salters, Banchero credited the victory to \"620,\" which observers interpreted as a remixed version of his native 206 area code."}

Russell Westbrook rises in the rankings after finally signing ... with the Sacramento Kings . Westbrook joins a backcourt where Dennis Schroder was the presumptive starting point guard, and regardless who starts it is likely both will play significant minutes. Westbrook has positive history with many of his new teammates, including Schroder, and is now solidified as a top-100 fantasy prospect in points leagues. Schroder takes a very small hit to his projections, since he may lose a few minutes to Westbrook. Keegan Murray will miss the next 4-6 weeks with a torn UCL ligament in his left thumb. If those estimates hold true, he would miss between 12 and 19 games before he could return. Ace Bailey is experiencing knee tendinitis in both knees. He may miss some time in the preseason, though it isn't clear whether this issue will officially impact his regular season availability. Nevertheless, as a rookie with a lot of unknowns at this level, this news caused me to drop his projected games played slightly which brings him down a bit in the rankings. 1.

Cleveland unveiled the uniform Wednesday, a revamped version of the navy blue alternate threads the team wore from 2005 to '10 -- a period that notably includes the then- LeBron James -led 2006-07 team that made a run to the 2007 NBA Finals. The team is also using the jerseys to celebrate the franchise's 55th anniversary. The look, which the Cavaliers described as an \"exact replica\" in a news release, features a deep navy blue base, with wine and gold retro motifs. \"Cleveland\" is displayed on the chest of the jersey in the team's early 2000s-themed throwback font with a gold outline. Players' names and numbers are displayed in white lettering with a gold outline on the back. The legacy lives on. On sale now at https://t.co/gZSf5OiSN7 . #LetEmKnow Shorts for the look include Cleveland's iconic throwback \"C\" logo that features a sword piercing. Both the jersey and shorts are trimmed with the wine, navy and gold striped trim. According to the Cavaliers, the original alternate uniforms were a nod to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" jerseys from the 1970s -- an old-school look with white, yellow and red striped trimming that honored the 1975-76 season. Cleveland will pair the jerseys with a Classic Edition court, which features elements from the 2000s-era Cavaliers' hardwood. The Cavaliers will sport the throwback look in 11 games, including during their Christmas Day matchup against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. They will debut the uniforms during their Nov. 5 home matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers ."}

The 2024-25 season's Most Valuable Player, Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year will have a Gold NBA Logoman Patch placed on their uniforms, which will also be removed and inserted into rare trading cards.

Fanatics also signed James to a deal in early 2024; like Jordan, James previously had partnered with Upper Deck for his entire career. \"It's going to be really awesome for collectors to have LeBron autographs on officially licensed cards,\" Mahan said. Mahan told ESPN that the company has plans for James memorabilia, as well as releases that honor achievements of NBA stars of the \"past, present and figuring out how to celebrate real success.\" Mahan pointed to Topps' celebration when Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw reached 3,000 career strikeouts this season. \"We did one-of-one autographs for him and every other member of that club,\" Mahan said. \"So, you think about important milestones coming up in basketball, the opportunity to do that as guys move up the scoring leaderboard -- we want to honor the history of the game: There's having a piece of the moment from the first and last times people step on the court.\""}

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James is targeting a mid-November return to the floor after being sidelined with sciatica, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Wednesday. The Lakers announced Oct. 9 that James would be out 3-4 weeks, but Charania noted that James, 40, will take a \"patient approach\" with his rehabilitation process. Reports surfaced earlier this month that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute and would likely miss the entire NBA preseason . It was reported that James was ramping up his workload to prepare for the Lakers' season opener against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. However, his timeline to return has been pushed back, meaning he will miss his team's first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career. If James is indeed out until mid-November, it's possible he would miss the first 10-15 games of the season. The Lakers have a five-game road trip starting in Atlanta against the Hawks on Nov. 8 and don't play back in Los Angeles until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz . That game against the Hawks will be L.A.'s 10th game of the season. Notably, NBA awards such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA require players to play in at least 65 games. James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 70 games played during the 2024-25 season, en route to earning Second-Team All-NBA honors. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Sacramento Kings have reportedly signed forward Keegan Murray to a five-year, $140 million rookie extension, per ESPN's Shams Charania . The fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft was set to become a restricted free agent next summer, but this new deal locks him in with Sacramento through the 2030-31 season. The hope is that Murray can return to the version of himself that averaged 15.2 points on 35.8% from 3-point range in his sophomore season. He looked like a solid 3-and-D threat that season, but his numbers took a dive last season (12.4 points, 34.3% from deep), in part due to all of the changes around him on the roster with the additions of DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , and the departure of De'Aaron Fox . There was also the firing of Mike Brown and promoting Doug Christie to the lead position, which certainly contributed to Murray's third-year slump. But with a full offseason with this roster and coaching staff, Murray could certainly return to form. Unfortunately, though, he'll be starting the season on the injured list after suffering a torn ligament in his thumb which will keep him sidelined for 4-6 weeks . That's a massive loss out the gate for the Kings. But in the long-term, locking Murray into an extension is a win for a franchise that has seemed directionless over recent years. Murray's extension comes on the heels of the team signing veteran guard Russell Westbrook to a deal on Wednesday, adding him to an already overcrowded backcourt. It's unclear how Westbrook will fit on this roster, or what minutes he'll get given the team already employs Dennis Schröder, Malik Monk and Keon Ellis . But that's small potatoes when you consider all the bad moves the Kings have made over the years (like trading Tyrese Haliburton ). Signing Murray to an extension was the smart move. Either the Kings can see how Murray continues to develop, or he becomes a valuable trade chip for a contending team looking for size on the perimeter who is a career 37.2% 3-point shooter. Murray holds the Kings record for most 3s made in a single game (12), according CBS Sports research. He also broke the NBA rookie record for most 3-pointers in a season (206) and is one of just three players to post at least 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the last three seasons. The other two players in that category are Anthony Edwards and Derrick White , pretty good company to be in for the fourth-year forward. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "Draymond Green doesn't think he could average 20 points on a lottery team", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/draymond-green-doesnt-think-he-could-average-20-points-on-a-lottery-team/", "published_at": "2025-10-15T20:39:43+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Green has no desire to play \"bad basketball\" on a losing team", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Draymond Green begins his 14th NBA season when the Warriors take on the Lakers Oct. 22 on opening night. He is a four-time champion, Defensive Player of the Year winner, four-time All Star and two-time All-NBA player. He will retire as a first-ballot Hall of Famer easily, and despite the ever evolving roster around him, Green will almost certainly retire with the Warriors. But Green's also at the point in his career where we see some decline in players, which often leads to the team making a tough decision in moving on from them in favor of a younger -- or in Klay Thompson's case, a cheaper -- option. However, Green doesn't appear to be itching to leave Golden State, and even if he did it certainly wouldn't be for a rebuilding team. \"Could I average 20 [points] on a lottery team? I have no interest in doing that,\" Green said on the \"Why is Draymond Green Talking About Football?\" podcast when asked how much he could average on a lottery team. \"You want me to go play bad basketball? ... I once averaged 15 [points] on a great team. So, you do the math.\" Green is probably the worst person to ask that question to, because he's never been the type of player to chase stats. The reason he's considered an all-time great is because he carved out a role for himself with the Warriors which consists of a lot of intangible things that don't show up on the box score. He's going to be the defensive anchor, capable of sliding between multiple positions, can be the connector offensively as a facilitator and is the heart of the Warriors dynasty with his fiery personality which has its pros and cons. That lone season Green averaged 15 points (actually was 14 points but that's a minor discrepancy) is the year that the Warriors set the record for most regular season wins with 73. That team clicked on all cylinders in more ways than one, and could be considered the peak of Golden State's powers despite losing in the Finals to LeBron James and the Cavaliers . Since that year, Green's role has been less of a scorer and more as a Swiss army knife doing whatever is necessary. \"I don't know if I have that mindset anymore,\" Green said. \"That's a mindset that you have to have, and I left that mindset so long ago that I'm not sure I could even tap back into that. ... The reason I got to the NBA is because I could score. To then come into the NBA and be doing that, and then like have to switch the whole thing up, it's hard to just go back to that. It requires you to change how you see the game. There's a certain way that I had to start seeing the game for our teams to work. So to then try to flip back to that, it's a very tough thing to do.\" Luckily, Green probably doesn't have to concern himself with those hypotheticals, because it would be incredibly shocking if he didn't retire with the Warriors. Or at the very least if he were to leave, he'd certainly join another championship-contending team. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

We all have our favorites. Every year, the NBA staff at CBS Sports ranks the 100 best players in the league. And every year, inevitably, each of us has a player or two that we ranked substantially higher than everyone else. Maybe it's a young player we expect to grow. Maybe it's someone on a team we happen to watch more than others. Maybe it's a player who's been stuck in the wrong circumstances but is primed for a breakout. Or maybe it's just irrational faith. But it's a central part of the basketball-viewing experience. We all have players that we simply believe in more than anyone else. So this year, we're going to put our metaphorical money where our mouths are. Each of us decided to highlight one player that we ranked higher than all or most of the rest of the voters. Below, we will explain what we see in those players that the rest of the basketball world does not. These are the players that our staff consider to be the most underrated in the NBA going into the 2025-26 season. The Pelicans are so cursed that the one reasonably consistent part of their team is by far the most overlooked. Trey Murphy isn't the predestined franchise player battling conditioning issues like Zion Williamson . He's not the ace defender with wildly fluctuating shooting percentages like Herb Jones. He's really the only young player in New Orleans who has simply arrived and progressed in a somewhat linear fashion towards potential stardom. You can count on one hand how many players combine his shooting and athleticism, and with so many teammates missing time last season, Murphy, No. 72 on our list, got his first taste of a star-caliber work load. He handled it with aplomb, largely maintaining his efficiency despite increased volume while getting to the line and assisting at career-best rates. Things may be rough in New Orleans, but Murphy is the diamond waiting to be mined from this mess. -- Sam Quinn There's been so much discussion about the Nuggets ' offseason acquisitions to boost their depth that it seems like everyone has forgotten about Braun, who snuck on to our list at No. 95. He was awesome last season in a breakout campaign in which he averaged an extremely efficient 15.4 points on 58/39.7/82.7 shooting splits. Only four other players in the league averaged at least 15 points on 58% shooting or better last season, and they were all centers: Giannis Antetokounmpo , Domantas Sabonis , Mark Williams and Ivica Zubac . Braun is an excellent cutter and finishes everything in transition, which makes him a perfect partner for Nikola Jokić. No Nuggets teammates played more minutes together than Braun and Jokić, and when they were on the floor Denver had a plus-11.8 net rating. The big question for Braun and the Nuggets is whether he can become a more consistent outside shooter. He shot 39.7% last season, but only took 2.8 attempts per game; in the playoffs, when teams dared him to beat them, he made just 29.6% of 5.1 attempts per game. -- Jack Maloney I anticipate a minutes bump and an All-Defense nod for Thompson this season, and I bet he'll be much higher on next year's list. Yes, his poor shooting is a problem, but, fortunately, he's awesome at pretty much everything else. Few defenders are as much of a menace one-on-one, and his feel for the game on both ends is exceptional. Thompson, ranked 75th on our list, gets ridiculous rebounds, and the Pistons plan to put him on the ball a lot more this season , which means everybody will get to see that he has much more to offer on offense than his cutting in the halfcourt and his speed in transition. -- James Herbert I understand why the ranking on Embiid was so varied, given injuries have to factor into these projections. That said, if Embiid can get back to even playing 50+ games this season (certainly a big if), I think 26 is far lower than he belongs. He is one of the most dominant forces in the game when he's functional, and as he ramps up for the regular season, the hope is he's closer to the level we saw before his latest knee injury in 2023-24. I don't know if we'll ever see the MVP-level Embiid again, but even if he's 85% of the player he was at his peak, he's among the game's best bigs. This is a player who averaged north of 30 points and 10 rebounds per game for three straight seasons (while providing high-end rim protection). Perhaps I'm wish-casting a bit here, but I really hope we see at least one more run of Embiid near his best because he is one of the most unique, talented forces the league has ever seen. -- Robby Kalland Maybe Josh Hart's problem is that he's too easy to forget. Or at least he's severely undervalued. But this guy -- ranked 94th in our Top 100 -- does everything for the Knicks . I could've made the argument that he was New York's second-most important player last season. You might not agree, but I assure you on a lot of nights it's an honest argument. He swings so many games with his rebounding, pace pushing, end-to-end buckets, et cetera. We all love to focus on some of the lineup limitations he brings because of his shooting inconsistencies, but bottom line is Hart can be a borderline top-50 player when it comes down to impacting winning. -- Brad Botkin © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

New York Knicks guard Malcolm Brogdon is retiring at 32 years old, he told ESPN Wednesday. The nine-season veteran's decision comes exactly one week ahead of the Knicks' season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers . \"Today, I officially begin my transition out of my basketball career,\" he said in a statement . \"I have proudly given my mind, body, and spirit to the game over the last few decades. With the many sacrifices it took to get here, I have received many rewards. I am deeply grateful to have arrived to this point on my own terms and now to be able to reap the benefits of my career with my family and friends. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all who have had a place in my journey.\" Brogdon signed a one-year deal with the Knicks last month. He appeared in line to be a part of the team's backcourt depth plans behind Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart and had played in all four of the team's preseason games. New York also has Miles McBride and Jordan Clarkson , among others, though Brogdon's ability to play both guard spots could have proven helpful. The Knicks, in their first season under coach Mike Brown, are +410 to win the Eastern Conference (via FanDuel ), with only the Cleveland Cavaliers (+200) having shorter odds. The Milwaukee Bucks selected Brogdon 36th overall in the 2016 NBA Draft out of Virginia, and he won Rookie of the Year thanks to a stellar debut. After three seasons in Milwaukee, he was traded to the Indiana Pacers for several picks. Following three years in Indiana -- including the 2020-21 season in which he averaged a career-high 21.2 points per game -- he was traded to the Boston Celtics . In Boston, he became a full-time bench player for the first time in his career, and it worked out very well, as he won Sixth Man of the Year in 2023. He is one of just two players in NBA history to win both Rookie of the Year and Sixth Man of the Year. Brogdon then headed to the Portland Trail Blazers in the deal that netted the Celtics Jrue Holiday before being traded to the Washington Wizards as part of the Deni Avdija deal after just one year in the Pacific Northwest. Injuries hampered Brogdon throughout his career and he appeared in just 63 games over the past two seasons, but he was productive when he was able to play. He averaged double-digit points in all nine of his NBA seasons and finishes his career with career averages of 15.3 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game as well as a 38.8% mark from 3-point range. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

After losing to the Golden State Warriors in an intense seven-game playoff series back in 2023, it seemed like the Sacramento Kings had finally escaped the mediocrity that surrounded the franchise for the better part of the last decade. The Kings broke the longest playoff drought in North American sports, finished with the No. 1 offensive rating in NBA history (at the time), and finally, for once, had a clear direction with Mike Brown as coach and De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis as co-stars. Since that moment, most of the transactions the franchise has made -- highlighted most recently by the signing of former league MVP Russell Westbrook on Wednesday -- are more signs that Sacramento is heading in the wrong direction with a roster that lacks balance and makes no sense. A metaphor to describe Sacramento's current roster -- that has an influx of guards and very little playable forwards -- is to think of your local all-you-can-eat buffet, which probably serves a variety of cuisines. Sure, on the surface, having all the food options you could imagine sounds amazing, but would cheese pizza really pair well with seafood? Probably not. And that's exactly what Sacramento's current roster is -- a bunch of dishes that could make sense individually (in this case, on different teams), but paired together would make your stomach turn. The on-court product has a similar senetiment. Westbrook is approaching the twilight of his career. There is no denying he has had his moments -- for better or worse -- while playing for five different teams since 2019. Westbrook is still a good leader and someone who can provide a spark off the bench, but does he really make sense for a team that has a logjam of guards already? Sacramento entered this offseason without a true point guard on the roster, which, to Westbrook's credit, he still is. The Kings signed Dennis Schröder to a three-year deal after a sign-and-trade with the Detroit Pistons , which ended up dragging along during the start of free agency because Sacramento had strong reported interest in restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga . But with Westbrook, Schröder, Malik Monk , DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine -- the headliner in the trade that sent Fox to the San Antonio Spurs at last season's trade deadline -- the Kings have a team built to compete for a play-in berth instead of looking in the mirror, having the uncomfortable conversation about how everyone fits together on the roster and developing the young talent the franchise has. Sacramento is +185 ( on FanDuel ) to make the Play-In Tournament. The Kings have the sixth-best odds to make the play-in behind the Spurs, Mavericks , Grizzlies , Lakers and Warriors. Going back to the winter of 2022 -- before that season's trade deadline -- the Kings had a logjam of point guards on the team, with Tyrese Haliburton , Davion Mitchell and Fox on the roster. The fit of Haliburton and Fox never quite worked out. It was part of the reason why the front office could stomach trading Halliburton to the Indiana Pacers for Domantas Sabonis because Sacramento believed he could elevate their offense while serving as the playmaking hub, which he did during the 2022-23 season. The problem, however, dating back to the playoff loss in 2023, is that the Kings failed to make the big swing under former general manager Monte McNair. The Kings were linked to various trade targets in recent years, including OG Anunoby , Pascal Siakam , Lauri Markkanen , Alex Caruso and more. All of those names would've filled a clear need at the wing next to Keegan Murray , who is now set to miss at least the next four to six weeks after undergoing surgery on his thumb. It's part of the reason why the Houston Rockets ' big swing on trading for Kevin Durant was so admirable. After catching lightning in a bottle and having a remarkable turnaround en route to the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, Houston parlayed that by making a substantial upgrade to its roster that puts the franchise in a position to make a run at the title this season. Without Murray, the Kings don't have a serviceable starting-level replacement on the roster. Sure, you can play DeRozan or even rookie Nique Clifford -- who was a star during summer league -- at the four, but both players would be undersized and overmatched for their respective matchups on a given night. That's part of the reason why Sacramento this offseason was reportedly so infatuated with the idea of pairing Murray with Kuminga in the frontcourt. Sacramento would have two forwards to build around who would complement each other's skill sets. Kuminga, who is eligible to be traded by the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 15, 2026, would've been the youngest player on Sacramento's roster. The direction Sacramento should take is a simple one that owner Vivek Ranadivé has shown he is not willing to do since buying the team in 2013: rebuild. The 2026 NBA Draft is loaded at the top, and the Kings (outside of a 2031 pick swap with the Spurs) have all their future firsts. There are three players in particular worth keeping an eye on: BYU's AJ Dybantsa, Kansas' Darryn Peterson and Duke's Cameron Boozer. Even outside of that, Tennessee's Nate Ament and Louisville's Mikel Brown Jr. look worth losing for. All of those players would give Sacramento a true building block and clear direction heading into the 2026-27 season and beyond. However, the signing of Westbrook signals the Kings aren't ready to take that necessary step to one day return to the playoffs. Instead of playing former first-round pick Devin Carter , soon-to-be free agent Keon Ellis , Clifford, Murray and other young pieces on the roster substantial minutes, they will likely be relegated to smaller roles with the veterans taking the front seat toward a berth in the play-in. Signing Westbrook for the minimum isn't the problem at the end of the day. In fact, most of the moves Sacramento made to put itself in this position in the first place were by (current Kings general manager) Scott Perry's predecessor. Perry, who has experience rebuilding rosters, once again finds himself behind the eight ball with an expensive roster that lacks a clear identity. With one week until the Kings begin their season against the Phoenix Suns , Sacramento has a roster that makes no sense -- with no clear resolution in sight. If Ranadivé's goal is to fill the arena by adding big-ticket players, then signing Westbrook accomplishes the mission and fulfills the shortsided vision. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Sacramento Kings are signing free agent point guard Russell Westbrook , his agent told ESPN's Shams Charania . Details of the deal weren't immediately reported, but the expectation is that Westbrook is signing for his veteran minimum to help bolster Sacramento's backcourt rotation. Westbrook, 36, will be playing his 18th NBA season for his seventh different team after spending the 2024-25 campaign with the Denver Nuggets . Since Westbrook was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Houston Rockets in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Nuggets. The Kings will be Westbrook's fourth different team since the start of the 2022-23 season. With Westbrook going to Sacramento, he will provide point guard depth to a team that entered the offseason without a true player at the position on the roster. The Kings signed free agent point guard Dennis Schröder to a three-year deal earlier this offseason but had strong interest in Westbrook dating back to the opening of free agency in July. Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver, averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Sacramento entered the offseason with a logjam in the backcourt with Keon Ellis , Malik Monk , DeMar DeRozan , Zach LaVine , Devin Carter and new first-round rookie Nique Clifford . When the Kings traded De'Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs at last season's trade deadline, Sacramento experimented with Monk at point guard after he entered the season as a reserve, but it didn't work out. The Kings open the 2025-26 season against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 22. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Lists like this -- 25 under 25 in this case -- lists are not uncommon, especially heading into the 2025-26 NBA season. But instead of adding to the significant amount of discourse already in that area, we're going to tweak that concept just a bit and rank the 25 best prospects in the NBA today. Ranking prospects can be vastly different than players because one is about forecasting for the future, while the other is an assessment of where they are today. In other words, this list is more about who are the best long-term assets, or who could be the best players when they reach their prime, and not who are the best today. Put it another way, if salary camp implications weren't a consideration, which active NBA players under the age of 25 would you most like to have if you were building a roster. Let's get to it. This list is debatable at virtually every spot, except this one. The only way that Wemby isn't the best long-term prospect in the NBA is if durability becomes a huge problem. Despite last year's blood clot issue, we don't have any evidence that is the case. To the contrary, prior to that, his availability had exceeded expectations. His unprecedented overlap of measurables and mobility allows him to change the game defensively unlike any other player in the league. Offensively, he's been given the freedom to shoot threes and stretch his game over the last two years and, while some of his efficiency metrics could trend up, he showed more alpha potential than even most projected on draft night two years ago. The bottom line is that if he's healthy, he's every bit the generational talent that was promised. Edwards may be one of the older players on this list, but he's also one of the best players in the NBA right now. He put up 28 points per game last year while leading the association in made 3s. For those of us that have been tracking him since high school, it's the escalation of his shooting that has proven to be the biggest surprise. The force with which he can create is not unsurprisingly, but couple that with the shooting and creation for others, and you have a player who looks poised to be one of the league's best guards for the foreseeable future. Of course, nothing cements a player's reputation like their production under the bright lights, and the 24-year-old has already developed a reputation for having that clutch gene come playoff time. The 22-year-old Banchero is coming off a shortened 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged nearly 26 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists. So, while there are probably a handful of reasonable candidates to round out the top three, ultimately Banchero got the nod for two distinct reasons. First and foremost is the extreme rate of improvement. I've been watching him live since the spring of his freshman year of high school and seen him make notable jumps with each passing year. Second, despite being just 22-years-old, he's already a proven offensive focal point. This year, he's going to have the chance to prove he can do it on a contender as the addition of Desmond Bane should be critical to taking the Magic to the next level. Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now : While I don't expect Flagg to be better this season than everyone below him on this list, this ranking is on long-term potential. If I were starting a team today, I would choose to build around him rather than anyone else besides the aforementioned three. He can play multiple positions, change the game defensively, and has an ideal overlap of intense competitor and instinctive processor. If he proves he can be the type of offensive alpha who can lead a contending team, then this spot might even prove to be too low, but it's relatively aggressive given some of the already proven prospects that are still behind him. He's also 18 years old. In other words, he's got a runway of the next 15-plus years. What we saw last season was essentially what most of us who have seen Cunningham since high school have been expecting for years. Cunningham became one of the best players in the NBA. He not only averaged 26 points, nine assists, and six rebounds per game, but he put up a career high 35.6% from 3 on a career high 5.3 attempts per game, all the while leading the NBA's most-improved team. The shooting fell off a little bit in the playoffs, but everything else was just as good. Simultaneously, he was very solid on the defensive end of the floor. So, if the shooting keeps getting more reliable, especially in key moments, and most importantly he stays healthy, Cunningham should be poised to play the best basketball of his career for the next five or so years. SGA may have been the MVP, but Williams was just as valuable to OKC's championship run. His versatility, two-way impact, and consistent improvement are all widely acknowledged, and rightfully so. Beyond that though was his toughness to play through injury and unselfishness to buy into his role and not allow any fraction or dissent to be formed around role allocation. The only knock is that he is more Robin than Batman on the offensive end, but that may be contextual. Not only did he put up 22 points per game on 48/37/79 shooting, but he averaged five assists per game and was one of the best iso scores in the NBA according to the advanced analytics. Other than Wemby, Holmgren is the young center that I would most want to build my roster around for the foreseeable future. In a league that values two-way versatility and offensive spacing, Holmgren is a 7-footer who can stretch the floor and already an elite rim protector. The durability of his frame has been a talking point for years now, and after missing the 2022-23 season and 50 regular-season games last year, that's going to continue to be a key variable in his future. However, he's functionally stronger than almost anyone expected, provides optionality to their lineups because of his ability to play the four or five, and is still sacrificing some of his individual offense to build this young championship core. There is a case to be made that Thompson is both the best athlete and non-Wemby defender in the NBA. He's also one of the more versatile, and maybe even positionless, players in the NBA. In just two seasons, we've seen him guard everyone from opposing big men to guards. Now, to start Year 3, with Fred VanVleet going down with injury and Ime Udoka experimenting with some jumbo line-ups in the preseason, we may get a chance to see if Thompson has some of that point guard potential that was talked about a couple of years ago when he was going through the pre-draft process. The reining Defensive Player of the Year was also named second team All-NBA last year, while pushing his numbers to nearly 19 points and nine rebounds per game on a Cavs team that won 64 games. Essentially, it was the realization of the vast potential that has been easily recognizable since his days in high school. The 24-year-old is poised to be the hub of a top-notch defense for years to come, but it will be the progression of his offensive game that ultimately dictates his ceiling. Based on the early reviews this preseason, when Mobley has been handling the ball and extending his range more, his two-way versatility appears to be still ascending. Sengun is the most polarizing player among the top 10, even among NBA decision-makers. His supporters cite his interior skill, playmaking from the 5 spot, and surprising durability. His doubters the limited athleticism, lack of defensive versatility, and rim protection. He is starting this season in the best shape of his career so far, with an opportunity to be even more of a playmaker in VanFleet's absence, and alongside a generational scorer like Kevin Durant . It's also worth noting that Sengun doesn't rely on athleticism to be productive, so the 23-year-old's style should age well. Maxey is the oldest player on this list and will turn 25 in less than a month. Put another way, while some players project to be trending up for the foreseeable future, he's now probably in his prime. The 2023-24 season was one in which he showed real potential stardom. Last year wasn't just riddled by injuries, but also declining efficiencies and a 3-point percentage that was almost 10% lower than two years prior. With Maxey's ability to make on-ball reads having dramatically improved over the years, he can be virtually unguardable when the 3s are falling. Increased physicality and durability are other points of emphasis, as he steps into more of a true leadership role for the Sixers. Is he or is he not a true No. 1 option on offense? That is one of, if not the, biggest question that faces the Raptors moving forward. Getting a definitive answer to that question is also one of the major subplots of this season. Barnes was a 22-year-old All-Star a couple of years ago, but saw his numbers drop across the board last year as his volume increased. Even if he proves to be better suited as a secondary option though, he still has the potential to impact the game in a multitude of ways, on both ends of the floor. The key variable hasn't changed since he was in high school though ... so much of it comes down to the shooting. We're now at the point on the list where we've exhausted all the probable lead creators. In Orlando, Wagner has been slotted as the secondary option behind Banchero, and yet he still put up 24 points, six boards, and five dimes last season. The combination of wing size at 6-foot-10 and playmaking off the dribble, makes him a true mismatch problem, while his defensive value is often understated as well. For a non-primary though, the floor spacing is going to have to keep coming. He's been under 30% from behind the arc for two consecutive years, despite being above 85% from the free-throw line, and needs to be able to create more space off the ball. What we said on draft night four months ago remains true today. Harper is a big lead guard with size, strength, length, and terrific natural instincts. His long-term success is going to come down to three key variables: shooting, durability and defense. He's battled nagging injuries for years, historically has had a bit of a flatter shot, and never had to truly commit to maximizing his defense. But he has all the tools and talent and now looks like he could be the best sub-20 point guard prospect in the league. Johnson finally started to turn potential into production as a 21-year-old back in the 2023-24. Last year, came the full breakout before he was derailed by a shoulder injury. A high-level athlete on the wing with positional size and playmaking for others, he now looks like a real building block for Atlanta. The only caveat is that this optimism is based on two seasons in which he has played only a combined 92 games. So, like others on this list, shooting and durability are key pieces. Alongside an ultra-skilled shot-maker like Trae Young though, he's found an ideal fit to maximize what he does best. Staying in Atlanta, we have one of the best up-and-coming perimeter defenders in the league. Daniels' defensive playmaking metrics were off the charts last year with 3.7 stocks per game and nearly six rebounds leading to the Most Improved Player award. Not only is he a playmaker on that end, but he protects Young, and simultaneously made notable strides with his offense. If he can sustain, or continue, the gains he made as a floor spacer and keep providing some secondary creation, his value should only continue to ascend this year for the Hawks. Just three years removed from being the 21st pick, Braun has already proven to be one of the best picks of his draft class. He moved into the starting lineup last season and more than doubled his production, averaging 15 points, five boards, and nearly three assists on 58/40/83 shooting. What's a little misleading is that he attempted only three threes in his roughly 34 minutes per game, so his gravity will increase with his volume, but he's an extremely efficient transition finisher to complement Nikola Jokic 's open court passing, and also a plus defender. In short, he may not be a star, but he looks like a long-term NBA starter. After four seasons in Washington, Avdija's new zip code brought a breakout year with the Blazers. He averaged 17 points, seven boards, and four assists while sustaining the notable jump in 3-point shooting that he posted the year before with the Wizards . The best part was that he continued to raise the level of his game as the season went on. At 6-foot-9, he combines strength and physicality with playmaking off the dribble to create a definite mismatch problem, not to mention a solid positional defender. Now he looks like a core building block moving forward for Portland. Lively exceeded expectations right out of the gate as a rookie in Dallas, and maintained those numbers, albeit in an injury-plagued sophomore year. Still just 21 years old, the hope is that he will establish himself as the Mavs' clear-cut top center this season. He has immense defensive potential with his size, length, shot-blocking, and relative mobility. Offensively, he's a lob threat and extremely efficient finisher, although life without Luka Dončić may be a bit different. That niche alone gives him the potential to be a starting center in this league for the next decade, so long as he can stay healthy. Miller was recently tabbed by league GM's as one of the favorites to have a breakout season. While he played just 27 games last season, we saw some clear evidence of where his game was trending. He was taking a high-volume approach from behind the arc and basing the rest of his attack around the threat of his jumper. There was growth as a passer for others, but continued struggles as a finisher, and defender. This year, it feels like Charlotte is at a crossroads and needs to decide if they'll continue to build around Miller and LaMelo Ball . Last year's Rookie of the Year is a big guard with size, strength, athleticism, on-off ball versatility and two-ways tools. He was already one of the Spurs' best perimeter defenders last year, not to mention a consistent scoring threat at 15 points per game. The question this year is whether or not he can take the next step in a perimeter rotation that is both young and collectively strained from a spacing perspective. In other words, how are all these driving playmakers going to coexist if they can't space the floor for each other. This is bound to be the most debated spot on the list. To be clear, this isn't about sheer talent. Ball's natural ability with the basketball, creativity, and vision, coupled by his tremendous positional size, form the profile of a truly elite prospect. Through five NBA seasons though, there are two glaring problems and a looming question. First, he can't stay healthy. He's played more than 51 games just once and hasn't eclipsed 47 games in any of the last three years. Second, he's one of the most lackadaisical defenders in the league. Put it together, and despite his gifts, Charlotte has to be wondering if he can ever drive winning at a consistent level. The case for Bailey is simple -- he's a high-level athlete with wing size and tough shot-making ability. The case against him has to do with his overall feel and efficiency. The summer league provided evidence for both perspectives. What has been encouraging though are the early returns in the preseason as Bailey has already made real strides with his understanding of how to get to spots, not waste dribbles, and move without the ball. You never want to overvalue the preseason, but the signs of growth are real and his upside has always been undeniable. Anyone who followed last year's draft knows Edgecombe is an elite athlete, has a ton of defensive upside, and a consistently developing offensive game. What most people don't yet have a full appreciation for is his competitiveness and drive to improve. It's that, and not just the physical tools, which could fuel his development in the coming years. There's clearly plenty of work to be done, but Edgecombe is poised to be an overachiever. There's a case to be made that Giddey is one of the more undervalued young players in the league. He's been a starter in all four years in the association. Last year, his first in Chicago, he averaged 15 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists on 47/38/78 shooting. After the All-Star break, he put up 21 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists per game. Those all-star caliber numbers earned him a new 100-million-dollar contract, but still arguably not enough respect across the league. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Take last year's list for the 2024-25 season. Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels ? Unranked. Breakout Rockets star Amen Thompson ? Unranked. Ivica Zubac made a late run at an All-NBA selection. He did not, however, make our list of the 100 best players in the sport. Inevitably, we end up with a bit of egg on our faces. We correct that a year later, of course, but the nature of the exercise practically necessitates mistakes. We can't see the future even if the list is meant to look towards it. Players often make the list based on expected future performance, but if we knew for certain which players were set to improve, well, teams would probably try to hire us because they don't know for sure either. A lot of the fun of the beginning of the season is seeing which players break out unexpectedly. So today, we're going to try to take a stab at figuring that out. The following 10 players did not make our top 100 ranking. But for one reason or another, they are players who could make us look foolish for excluding them, and then ultimately make next year's list as an apology. Of course, there are some pretty obvious candidates for a list like this, so to make it more interesting, we're going to exclude a few people. For starters, no 2025 rookies are eligible here. We haven't even seen them play. We're also barring No. 1 picks in the first five years of their careers (sorry Zaccharie Risacher ) and Rookie of the Year winners (so long Stephon Castle ). There's no fun in predicting when players like that will make a leap. No, we're looking for slightly deeper cuts here. This list includes just one top-five pick on a rookie contract, and he has played less than 1,000 NBA minutes. Meanwhile, we have two undrafted free agents, two veterans on their fourth NBA teams and another on his third, and a late first-round pick with less than 400 minutes to his name. So here are 10 players, some of whom have obvious paths, others who'd be coming out of nowhere, who could crack next year's top 100 list. Grimes very easily could have made this year's list. He averaged almost 22 points per game as a 76er ... but he did it as a 76er, which meant he did it for the most aggressive tankers of last season. Were those empty calories? Or signs of true growth? We'll find out this season as Grimes attempts to fit into a healthier and hopefully more competitive Philadelphia team than the one he played for last season. Considering his experience as a 3-and-D wing in New York, though, he should be perfectly capable of sliding into the background for the Sixers. Combine the role player skills from his Knicks years and the high-level scoring from March and April, and you have a no-brainer top 100 player. Are we cheating a little bit by excluding the No. 1 pick in 2024 but accepting the No. 3 pick? Maybe, but Zaccharie Risacher played real minutes last season. Sheppard didn't. Now, with Fred VanVleet out, he'll have to. He's fortunately in an ideal situation for his skill set. The Rockets can cover for his size issue on defense and likely won't ask him to handle the ball too much. But they badly need his shooting, and he should be able to get good looks in an offense led by Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun . Elite shooting can get a player onto the top 100. Payton Pritchard is the obvious analogue. We don't know if Sheppard is ready for that yet, but the Rockets wouldn't have taken him No. 3 if they didn't think he could get there. Everything is lining up for Sharpe this season. He's been a training camp standout by all accounts. He has Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard in the building as mentors. Portland has seemingly solved its defense. What it needs is a primary scorer on offense, and with Scoot Henderson out early in the season, Sharpe won't even have competition from another high lottery pick. This is his moment to prove that he can be a cornerstone player. He has the athletic gifts. If he can make 3s consistently and improve his decision-making, he's an obvious top 100 candidate for next season and a possible Most Improved Player this year. At his peak in 2021, Deandre Ayton ranked 51st on our top 100 list. We weren't abnormally high on him either. The Pacers gave him a max offer sheet, and then the Suns matched it. He has the tools to be a high-level starting center. Lately, he hasn't had the motivation. But how many times have we seen a down-on-his-luck veteran join a LeBron James team and suddenly rediscover his old magic ? Is Ayton really that different from 2020 Dwight Howard ? He's in an ideal position now. Between James, Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić, he's never had more playmaking around him. If that doesn't motivate him to play harder and do the dirty work, nothing will. But if we get the 2021 version of him in a contract year? It's not hard to imagine him making it back onto the list next year. Matas Buzelis flashed just about every important skill at some point last season. His handle needs work, but it was impressive for a rookie of his size. He was a league-average shooter last year on reasonable volume, which few saw coming, and he was a surprisingly capable defensive playmaker already. But you're not here for that stuff. You're here for the 6-10 dude with insane hops throwing down monster jams. The other stuff is what he needs to be a well-rounded NBA player. The hope is that he continues to grow as a ball-handler, that his shooting growth continues. If that happens, he has star potential. But that stuff takes time. What we'll absolutely see this season is this athletic giant running the floor and owning highlight reels on one of the league's fastest teams. He's already a nerd favorite. He'll be a social media darling before long as well. Our top 100, especially the bottom half, is stuffed full of 3-and-D role players. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has never been a full-time starter and he snuck into the final slot. Ellis hasn't had the widespread exposure that Alexander-Walker did on a contending Timberwolves team because he's been stuck on the Kings , but he's an absolutely ferocious point-of-attack defender who's made just under 43% of his 3s in his three NBA seasons. If he played for a normal team, he'd have made the list by now. If he keeps this up, not even the Kings will be able to hold him off from future editions. Last year gave fans a newfound appreciation for a very specific sort of role player: those who can't play significant minutes for stylistic and durability-related reasons but absolutely own the minutes they do play. Think of Steven Adams in Houston last year, or Ty Jerome in Cleveland. T.J. McConnell almost won Indiana a championship in 18-minute increments. You could make credible arguments for any of them making the list under the logic that they are absolutely among the best 100 players in the NBA on a per-minute basis. The one I'll call attention to this season is Lonzo Ball, who is a match made in heaven for a Cleveland team that badly needed more transition creativity and on-ball defense. If Ball can give the Cavaliers 20 good minutes per night, the specific things he'll bring are so valuable that there will be a strong argument to get him back into the top 100 mix. A lot of the ingredients we've touched on for other players apply here. Newfound opportunity? Check. Without Tyrese Haliburton , someone needs to handle the ball more in Indiana. Contract year? Check. A good year could make Mathurin a lot of money. Draft pedigree? Check. Mathurin was a No. 6 pick, and even if he runs hot and cold, the playoffs showed just how valuable he can be when he's hot. If you can score in the mid-20s against Oklahoma City's historic defense multiple times in the Finals, there's a very valuable player hidden in there somewhere. Now, with the Pacers going through a gap year, we'll see if Mathurin can discover that form on a more permanent basis. I promised you deep cuts, didn't I? Shannon barely played last year... but Minnesota trusted him enough to give him real minutes in the Western Conference finals. Alexander-Walker is gone and someone has to take on his bench role, but with Mike Conley aging fast, there's also going to be a juicy playmaking opportunity available for Minnesota's young players if they can seize it. Rob Dillingham , as the higher draft pick, would be the obvious suspect. He's younger and has more theoretical upside. But Shannon is immediately playable on offense and was surprisingly stout defensively for a low-minutes rookie. If you can score consistently without taking other significant skills off the table, you can be a very valuable player pretty quickly. That's the argument here. Shannon will have a bigger role this season to showcase the rest of his game, and there were signs last year that were pretty promising. The longest of our long shots, and I do mean that literally, as Huff has a 7-5 wingspan. There is a gaping vacuum at center in Indiana, and their system relies on having a big man who can shoot. Huff was over 40% last season on 12.4 attempts per 100 possessions. He's a strong shot-blocker as well, and he's quite the showman as a dunker. Is he a likely top-100 player? Absolutely not. Come on, he's barely been a rotation player. But you just know someone is emerging out of nowhere in Indiana this season. Rick Carlisle has an 82-game blank slate to work with, and Huff offers the cheapest possible replication of Myles Turner 's skill set. The Pacers will give him every chance to succeed. He's under contract for essentially the minimum through 2028, so if he is a diamond in the rough, the Pacers will have him for the price of a ring pop for the foreseeable future. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Al Horford stood in limbo for the majority of the NBA offseason as an unrestricted free agent. In the end, the longtime Boston Celtics standout made a difficult decision to sign elsewhere. He agreed in late September to a two-year deal with the Golden State Warriors , ending his second stint in Boston, where he won the first championship of his career. The decision was twofold, said Horford, who indicated that he and the Celtics had different priorities for the 2025-26 season. This late in Horford's career, opportunities to add another championship ring are dwindling. He already reached the mountaintop with the Celtics, but with Jayson Tatum set to miss at least the majority, if not all, of the upcoming campaign with a torn Achilles tendon, Horford's best chance of winning another title may not be in Boston. \"There was two things there,\" Horford, 39, said to The Athletic . \"I think the financial part was a component, but more than that, it was the winning part of it, trying to contend for a championship. And I think there was a lot of things up in the air -- and it just felt like they weren't in that same vision, obviously, because JT getting hurt, that takes a big toll. Up until then I was staying in Boston the whole time.\" The Celtics were in a tricky spot financially this offseason because of the second apron. They traded Kristaps Porziņġis and Jrue Holiday in salary-shedding moves and watched as key reserve Luke Kornet walked in free agency. The talent exodus was in many ways a necessity. Because of those departures and Tatum's potential to miss the entire season, the Celtics project to take a step backward from their perennial spot in the Eastern Conference's upper echelon. \"I think once that offseason happened and it started to progress, it became clear to me the team had different priorities,\" Horford said. \"Obviously, getting rid of Jrue, getting rid of Kristaps. And I know it's all salary stuff, but it was like a domino effect, and it was tough for me.\" Horford's exit is another blow to the Celtics, whose frontcourt became thinner with each departure. He left a legacy across two stints with the franchise as an integral part of the 2024 championship run and one of the NBA 's top defenders on an annual basis. He remained highly prominent in the Celtics' lineup even at age 38. Golden State is, on paper, a terrific landing spot for Horford. He was everything the Celtics needed him to be, and he should fit just as well with the Warriors because of his defensive versatility and ability to step outside the 3-point line on the other end of the floor. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Dallas Mavericks and coach Jason Kidd have agreed to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Tuesday. The agreement comes just over a week before the team's season opener against the San Antonio Spurs . Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Kidd, 52, served as Mavericks coach for the last four seasons and posted a 179-149 record over that span. That includes a trip to the 2024 NBA Finals, where Dallas lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. Prior to his time in Dallas, he spent two seasons as a Lakers assistant after three-plus seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks , where he went 139-152. He got his coaching start in 2013-14 with the Brooklyn Nets , where he went 44-38 in one season before being traded to Milwaukee. Kidd became the subject of several coaching search conversations over the past few years, and the Mavericks denied the New York Knicks a chance to interview him for their vacancy earlier this offseason. A Hall of Fame inductee as a player in 2018, Kidd faces a big season with the Mavericks. Dallas stunningly dealt away Luka Doncić to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February 2025, receiving Anthony Davis , among others, in return. The trade was widely panned , and things went from bad to worse in Dallas when Davis was injured in his team debut and Kyrie Irving later tore his ACL. The injury-ravaged Mavericks finished 39-43 and got into the Play-In Tournament, where they beat the Sacramento Kings but lost to the Memphis Grizzlies with a playoff berth on the line. Then the Mavericks' fortunes miraculously reversed when they won the NBA Draft lottery despite having just a 1.8% chance to do so. That allowed Dallas to select Cooper Flagg , the consensus player of the year at Duke last season who has already impressed in the preseason. With Flagg in the fold alongside Davis, Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford , the Mavericks figure to have a fearsome frontcourt defense, with Klay Thompson and Max Christie among key wings returning. Free agent signee D'Angelo Russell will be the team's lead ballhandler until Irving returns, if Irving returns at all this season. Dallas is slightly favored to miss the playoffs (-138) at FanDuel Sportsbook , though if things go well health-wise and Flagg can make an immediate impact, the team will likely field one of the NBA 's best defenses and contend for the postseason. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley has interviewed for head coaching jobs in the NBA , most recently with the New York Knicks . However, she doesn't believe the league is getting a female head coach anytime soon. \"If I'm the Knicks coach and you have a five-game losing streak, it's not going to be about the losing streak,\" Staley said during Tuesday's SEC media day. \"It's going to be about being a female coach. So you as an organization, a franchise, you have to be prepared for and strong enough to ignore those types of instances when you're going to look to hire a female coach.\" Staley said she took the interview with the Knicks because she has known team president Leon Rose for decades. The team ultimately hired Mike Brown, who was most recently the coach of the Sacramento Kings from 2022-25 and ended that tenure with a 107-88 overall record. Staley also interviewed for the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021. Ultimately, not getting an NBA job was not a big loss for Staley, whose Gamecocks have won two of the last four national championships. The NBA job interviews were serious, but Staley admitted she might not really have it in her to be that kind of trailblazer. She was also asked if she thinks there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime, and she wasn't feeling too confident about it. \"No, I don't,\" Staley said. \"And I hope I'm wrong.\" That being said, she would be happy to help any woman who wants to try. \"If there is somebody that is interested in knowing and interested in being the first female NBA coach, I've got all the information,\" Staley said. \"Come see me, because I'll get you prepared for the interview. \"And if there are NBA franchises that are interested in hiring a female, I'm here, too, because you've got to be ready to take that on and all the things that it comes with because it's not just about hiring the first female coach.\" © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: Have the Hornets quietly put a nice core together?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-have-the-hornets-quietly-put-a-nice-core-together/", "published_at": "2025-10-14T21:44:41+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Charlotte Hornets, who have flanked LaMelo Ball with a pair of talented wings", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. What if this is the year that LaMelo Ball stays healthy? As bad as the Charlotte Hornets ' 2024-25 season was, they had a positive point differential in the 466 minutes he played with Brandon Miller and the 879 minutes he played with Miles Bridges . Ball is a wildly divisive player, but his vision and his touch are undeniable. This is his sixth season in Charlotte, and he showed long ago that he can lead an efficient offense. In the East, as long as the defense isn't dreadful, that might be enough to get into the play-in, especially if young wings Miller (the No. 2 pick in 2023) and Kon Knueppel (the No. 4 pick this year) produce at a high level. About that defense, though: The team's two best defenders -- Josh Green and Grant Williams -- will be sidelined at the beginning of the season, and, when Ball was on the court last season, the Hornets' halfcourt defense allowed 104.1 points per 100 possessions, which basically means it was hopeless. (As a point of reference, Phoenix gave up a league-worst 102.5 per 100 in the halfcourt.) Charlotte is alarmingly thin at center, with Moussa Diabaté, Mason Plumlee and rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner competing for minutes, and it's flush with offense-first guards, having added Collin Sexton and Spencer Dinwiddie to a roster that already included Ball, Tre Mann and summer league standout K.J. Simpson. You can envision a world in which the Hornets are buyers at the deadline, having shown the front office that it's worth adding reinforcements. You can also, however, envision them going the other way. Last year: Ball led all Eastern Conference guards in All-Star fan voting, but didn't make the cut because the players had him third, the media had him seventh and the coaches didn't vote him in as a reserve. After an insane late-November stretch that included a 50-point game in Milwaukee and a 44-point game against Orlando two days later, Ball was sidelined with a strained calf. Later he dealt with ankle and wrist injuries, so he ended up playing only 47 games. That was 20 more than Miller managed, as his season ended when he had wrist surgery in January. The Hornets were 8-28 when they traded center Nick Richards to the Suns in the middle of that month, and they were 12-36 when they tried to trade center Mark Williams to the Lakers at the trade deadline in February. That deal was controversially rescinded , so Mark Williams returned to a center rotation that featured Diabaté and Jusuf Nurkić, the latter of whom was acquired on deadline day from Phoenix along with a first-round pick in exchange for Cody Martin and Vasilije Micić. Charlotte finished 19-63, with the league's second-worst offense and fourth-worst net rating. The offseason: The Hornets drafted Knueppel with the No. 4 pick, wing Sion James with the No. 33 pick and Kalkbrenner with the No. 34 pick. They somehow picked up a future second-round pick by trading Nurkić for Sexton, and they also made yet another trade with the Suns, giving up Mark Williams (for real this time) and Micić for the No. 29 pick (which they used on forward Liam McNeely) and a 2029 first-rounder. In free agency, they reunited with Plumlee and signed Dinwiddie, both for the minimum, and they re-signed Mann to a three-year, $24 million deal. Las Vegas over/under: 27.5 wins, per BetMGM Hornets believer: The most important thing I have to say is that Kon is a pro . If you just watch Knueppel play for five minutes, you can see it all: The processing speed, the shooting, the off-ball movement, the competitiveness, the physicality. He reminds me so much of Desmond Bane , and I think he's the perfect kind of prospect for this team: He'll be a stabilizing force and solid complementary player from Day 1, plus he has star upside. With him and Brandon Miller on the wing, I feel better about the Hornets' core than I have in ages. In a few weeks, everybody's going to say Miller is having a \"breakout\" season, and it will only be half-true. Yes, I expect him to take a step forward, but even if he comes back the exact same player as he was before his wrist injury, his efficiency will tick up naturally because he won't have to carry a crazy load anymore. Hornets skeptic: I sure hope that's true about Miller. In his rookie season I really liked how he stepped up when Ball was out, but the numbers in those minutes last season -- 51.4% true shooting and 31% usage -- were discouraging. And with all due respect to Knueppel, the perfect prospect for this team would have been the guy he played with in college and went No. 1 to Dallas. Bane is an interesting comp, but what if Knueppel is more like Gordon Hayward ? I don't mean the younger, much more athletic version; I mean the one the Hornets had a couple of years ago. At this level, Knueppel's poor foot speed and generally unremarkable athleticism could be major issues, especially on defense. And if this team is going to continue to build around LaMelo Ball -- if you like, we can debate the wisdom of this! -- then the other guys need to be plus defenders. Hornets believer: You know what I meant about Knueppel. Winning the lottery would have been nice, obviously, but, failing that, it was ideal to get a player who will be at least a solid connective role player right away and could be closer to a primary playmaker down the road. Young Hayward isn't a bad comp in that respect, but Knueppel is much stronger than Hayward was at this stage. He was definitely a plus defender at Duke, and, unless Charles Lee asks him to press small guards 94 feet for some reason, I don't see quickness being much of a problem. Re: Ball, let me guess … you think the one-legged 3s are silly, he's not a winning player and the Hornets should just trade him? Hornets skeptic: I wouldn't put it quite like that. At this point, though, the burden is on Ball to prove that he is a winning player. Defensively, he can make amazing reads off the ball, but he's not always engaged and he needs to put up much more resistance one-on-one. Offensively, he might have the best highlights in the whole league, but the shot selection is still a mess and he still doesn't put much pressure on the rim as a driver. I want to see him improve his finishing, get to the line more often and generally be more intentional when he's initiating in the halfcourt. I also want to see him simply be available more often, as he's played just 105 total games over the last three seasons. Should the Hornets trade him? I mean, if I were them, I'd at least listen to offers. Given that he's signed to a contract that will pay him $46.4 million in 2028-29, though, I doubt they're getting a ton of calls about him. Hornets believer: We are talking about a 24-year-old who has already made an All-Star team and averaged 25 points per game in an NBA season. We are also talking about one of the most creative passers on the planet. Ball is far from a finished product, but that's to be expected. And between the injuries and the questionable decisions the franchise has made since drafting him, he hasn't exactly been in the best position to develop over the past few years. Still, he's gotten much stronger, and I've seen flashes of him improving in some of the ways you've outlined. Especially when Grant Williams and Josh Green get healthy, I think this year's Hornets will be able to put lineups on the court that minimize his weaknesses and accentuate his strengths much more effectively than they have recently. And in the spirit of being patient with young players, I must note that I'm curious to see if Tidjane Salaün is part of the solution in 2025-26. Charlotte knew he was a project when it drafted him, and he looked a lot more comfortable at summer league than he did as a rookie. Hornets skeptic: I'm not writing off Salaün before his 21st birthday, but I'm not getting my hopes up, either, and I'd be more optimistic about the Hornets if they'd taken Matas Buzelis instead. I'm glad you brought him up, though, because I sort of feel about him the way I feel about the team. As a prospect, Salaün's main selling points were that he plays extremely hard and has a high ceiling by virtue of his physical tools. In the same way, the idea of the Hornets is intriguing every year. Maybe Ball stays healthy and rounds out his game, maybe they turn into fun League Pass team that puts up tons of points and gets enough stops to string some wins together. But you can't seriously expect either Charlotte or the guy it picked No. 6 in 2024 to do anything serious this season, can you? © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put together one of the all-time great individual seasons for an NBA star in the 2024-25 season when he became the first player to win the league's scoring title, MVP, Finals MVP and a championship in the same season since Michael Jordan pulled off the same astonishing feat in 1997-98. And yet, despite producing a season we haven't seen in almost 30 years, I found myself on an island when ranking Gilgeous-Alexander in the top spot as the CBS Sports staff put together its Top 100 players in the NBA ahead of the 2025-26 season. That is because Nikola Jokić is busy rewriting history books himself, and he is a more than worthy candidate for that No. 1 position. The three-time MVP produced the best statistical season of his career in 2024-25, averaging a monstrous triple-double (29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 10.2 assists) and doing so on outrageous efficiency (66.3% true shooting). What I won't do here is argue against Jokić's greatness or insinuate he is anything short of an all-time great. I will state the case for Gilgeous-Alexander occupying the top spot for the upcoming season, as I believe we are witnessing the emergence of a superstar with similar dominance, but at the point guard position. Gilgeous-Alexander is the best version of the traditional, three-level scoring guard we've seen since Jordan. Even at his peak, Kobe Bryant didn't match the ruthless efficiency with which Gilgeous-Alexander operates as a high-volume scorer, never topping 46.9% from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander, meanwhile, has averaged north of 30 points per game in three straight seasons, shooting 51.0% or better in all of them. Beyond the efficiency, what separates Gilgeous-Alexander as a scorer from many of his contemporaries is his consistency. He has become the thing that separates the elite from just the greats -- inevitable. There are plenty of players in the NBA capable of great things in any given game, but an exceptional few who reach that level on a nightly basis. He has counters prepared for every defensive approach, allowing him to continue getting to his spots (and, yes, the foul line), scoring with efficiency, and keeping the Oklahoma City offense on track -- avoiding the pitfalls of grinding OKC's offense to a halt while trying to create for himself. He scored fewer than 20 points in a game one time in the 2024-25 regular season (an 18-point outing in the fourth game of the season) while scoring 30 or more on 49 occasions. In the playoffs, he had three outings below 20 points, while scoring 30 or more in 15 of the Thunder 's 23 playoff games en route to the title, even while struggling with his three-point shot against defenses trying to force anyone else to beat them. For as much as we discuss Jokić orchestrating everything for the Nuggets , Gilgeous-Alexander serves as an equally important engine for Oklahoma City. His 34.8% usage rate last season was third in the league, behind only LaMelo Ball and Giannis Antetokounmpo , with a key difference being SGA was doing so on the league's third best offense (119.2 offensive rating) -- Antetokounmpo's Bucks were 10th (115.1) and Ball's Hornets were 29th (106.7). It's exceedingly rare for a team as successful and efficient as the Thunder to rely so heavily on one player for creation, but that's a testament to Gilgeous-Alexander's abilities as both a scorer and facilitator. He pulls all of the strings for the Thunder and has learned how to toe the line between being an elite scorer and individual creator, while also keeping his teammates involved and engaged. Gilgeous-Alexander is tasked with making the right decisions with the ball almost all the time and does so astonishingly well, as his efficiency extends beyond scoring. He turns it over at a freakishly low rate, as his 8.6% turnover rate is the lowest of any of the top 20 in usage rate in the NBA last season. Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now : Gilgeous-Alexander couples that offensive prowess with high-level defense, operating as a plus-defender like a select few of his elite offensive peers. He led the league in defensive win shares last year (4.8), unquestionably a byproduct of a dominant team defense from Oklahoma City, but he plays his part in making the Thunder elite on defense both at the point of attack and as a versatile, switchable cog in the machine. That two-way ability puts Gilgeous-Alexander in a rare breed of superstar. It is what makes the Thunder not just a title contender but the runaway favorite entering the season. At 27 years old, the Canadian star is just entering his prime, and the terrifying proposition for the rest of the league is that it's possible he's still capable of being even better, with a long runway in front of him to rack up more accolades, titles and awards. Jokić is the current gold standard for sustained excellence as a superstar. He has three MVPs and two runner-up finishes in the last five years, producing stat lines never seen from anyone, much less a center. However, I believe Gilgeous-Alexander has a chance to pull off a similar run at the point guard position. He benefits from having the longest title window possible in the modern NBA with the construction of this Thunder team, but make no mistake, they're in that position because of him. The SGA era may very well be upon us, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's carrying the torch as the league's best player for years to come. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Between the aprons decimating rosters, the ever-present threat of injuries and the impossibly high bar each postseason sets for who is and is not playable on the biggest stage, we have officially reached the depth era of NBA history. It's not enough to have one or two stars. You have to have a team full of elite contributors. Every year, we rank the top 100 players in the NBA , and lately, those rankings have been pretty predictive of how that season plays out. At the time of our rankings last season, three teams tied with six selections apiece. They were the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder as well as the conference finalist New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves . Ironically, two of those teams, New York and Minnesota, went on to make a blockbuster trade after that list was initially published last September that pushed the Timberwolves up to seven selections, giving last year's Western Conference finals a total of 13 Top 100 players. Our previous champion, Boston, had all five starters ranked in the top 62, and the year prior, Denver won it all with four players in the top 75. The lesson here is relatively straightforward. As tempting as it is to fixate on the top handful of slots on a list like this, every single slot ultimately matters. We've moved beyond an NBA in which a top-five player or two can win a title on their own.

Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo has spent his entire 12-year NBA career as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks .

Antetokounmpo wants to finish his playing days in his home country of Greece. \"I'm 30 years old, I can play in the NBA until I'm 36-38. I'd like to end my career in a Greek team, why not?\" Antetokounmpo said on ANT1's The 2night Show . \"I don't want to live in the United States.

The Bucks made the NBA playoffs in 2024-25 but were eliminated in the opening round in five games by the eventual Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers . Antetokounmpo was the subject of trade rumors involving the New York Knicks during the offseason, but those talks never gained any serious momentum. However, just last week, Antetokounmpo revealed he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for the 2025-26 season, but is reserving the right to change his mind in six-to-seven months depending on the direction of the Bucks franchise. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Horizon League Player of the Year led the Bulldogs all the way to the national championship game against Duke , where his half-court buzzer beater attempt came agonizingly close. After that season ended, he went pro and the Utah Jazz drafted him ninth overall. After a strong ascension with Utah -- he made the All Star Game in 2016-17, his final year there -- he joined the Boston Celtics via free agency. His career took a shocking turn when he suffered a dislocated ankle and fractured tibia in the opening minutes of his Celtics tenure. He returned the following season and played three seasons in total for Boston before moving onto the Charlotte Hornets . He had a brief stint with the Thunder in 2023-24 and retired in August 2024. In his new role with the Bulldogs, Hayward. a 2022 Butler Athletics Hall of Fame inductee, will \"lean on his NBA experience to advise on talent evaluation and recruitment, player development, and team culture\" and \"serve in a mentorship role to student-athletes within the program, focusing on leadership and professional development.\" Hayward joins a growing list of players taking on similar roles. Recently, Jayson Tatum joined Duke as the Blue Devils' chief basketball officer, and Stephen Curry ( Davidson assistant general manager ) and Trae Young ( Oklahoma assistant general manager ) are among those who have joined their former school. Unlike those three, Hayward is retired, so he could potentially have more time to help out Thad Matta and company Butler made 10 of 12 NCAA Tournaments from 2007-18, including two national title games, but has not made the Tournament since. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Gabe Vincent pulled up for a three-pointer and nailed it. And then Vincent nailed his next three and his next three and his next, giving him four straight made treys. Vincent was on fire to start the game for the Lakers during their exhibition game against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night at T-Mobile Arena. Before Vincent could even think about getting off his fifth three-pointer, Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg smothered him. Vincent stumbled and fell, scrambling to keep control of the ball. He did and passed it to a teammate. When Vincent got to his feet and got the ball back, the fans began to shout, “Shooot it!” So, Vincent did, nailing his fifth three-pointer over the outstretched hand of the 6-9 Flagg, drawing more cheers from the pro-Lakers crowd. Vincent was fouled on his sixth three-point attempt, sending him to the free-throw line for three free throws, all of which he made. That gave Vincent 18 points in what seemed like a flash in the first quarter. Read more: LeBron out, Luka in: Where the Lakers stand one week from opening night He missed his next two three attempts, but that didn’t seem to matter to the crowd. Vincent had put on a show. Vincent finished the game with 22 points on six-for-15 shooting and six-for-11 on three-pointers during the Lakers’ 121-94 loss to the Mavericks that saw L.A. get outscored 37-8 in the fourth quarter. “I just wanted to come out aggressive,” Vincent said. “Obviously we were a few guys down. We knew we needed to play a little fast and I just wanted to come out and be aggressive and look for my shot. Guys found me early. They went in. That’s always helpful.” He was part of a Lakers’ starting group of Rui Hachimura (19 points), Jaxson Hayes (12 points, 10 rebounds), Jarred Vanderbilt and Dalton Knecht. None of them played in the game Tuesday night in Phoenix. Vanderbilt was having a good all-around game until he was forced to leave late in the second quarter with a left quad contusion after banging his left knee with a Mavericks defender. He limped up and down the court, but was still able to score on a dunk after he was injured and he drilled a three-pointer. But with five minutes and 39 seconds left in the second quarter, Vanderbilt limped back to the Lakers’ locker room and never returned to play. He had five points, seven rebounds and four assists in 13 minutes. Read more: JJ Redick isn't overly concerned about the Lakers' on-court chemistry “He can be a really impactful guy on both ends,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said about Vanderbilt. “Yyou can see he's moving better than he was last season. You can clearly tell that he's spent a lot of time working on his game this summer…Having him be able to guard multiple positions on the perimeter and be a crasher and hopefully a high-level corner spacer and a cutter…He can do a lot.” The starting five Lakers who did play against the Suns — Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia — didn’t play in the back-to-back game against the Mavericks, Doncic’s former team that traded him to the Lakers in February. Redick said Bronny James didn’t play because of a sprained ankle. The Lakers finish their preseason against the Sacramento Kings on Friday night at Crypto.com Arena, and from the sounds of things, Doncic and those who didn’t play against the Mavericks will play against the Suns. “And then Friday, yes, the plan is to do another dress rehearsal and likely play most of our guys,” Redick said before the game. “I don’t know the minutes total, but that’s the plan.” The Lakers open the regular season Tuesday against the Golden State Warriors at home.

Flagg and the Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Lakers 121-94 in their preseason finale on Wednesday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Flagg had 13 points, 3 assists and 2 rebounds in the win for Dallas. He played 28 minutes, too, marking his longest run in the preseason. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] The contest itself wasn’t anywhere near as entertaining as it could have been, considering the two teams. The Lakers were extremely short-handed, and former Mavericks star Luka Dončić didn’t play at all for Los Angeles. Dončić played against the Mavericks twice last season after the stunning trade that sent him to the Lakers and Anthony Davis to the Mavericks. That eventually led to the Mavericks winning the NBA Draft lottery for the first time in franchise history and selecting Flagg out of Duke. Flagg had a few highlights early on Wednesday while running the point, including a perfect backdoor cut that led to a two-handed slam and another wild and-one layup that he got to fall after absolutely working Dalton Knecht in the post. But the Lakers still held the advantage at the first break, thanks to 18 points from Gabe Vincent. He opened the night going a perfect 5-of-5 from behind the arc. He ended up making another in the second quarter and entered the locker room with 22 points at halftime — which pushed the Lakers to a 13-point lead. But Dallas finally started chipping away at that lead, and then erupted in the fourth quarter. The Mavericks outscored the Lakers 37-8 in the final period to roll to the 27-point win. Davis led the Mavericks with 18 points and nine rebounds while shooting 7-of-15 from the field. Dereck Lively added 12 points and 11 rebounds, and P.J. Washington finished with 13 points. Vincent didn't score again in the contest after his first half run. Rui Hachimura added 19 points, and Jaxson Hayes had 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers will end their preseason on Friday with a matchup against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers were extremely depleted Wednesday night. LeBron James is still sidelined due to sciatica in his right side, which is going to keep him out of the team’s opening night matchup against the Golden State Warriors. He is expected to return in mid-November. Bronny missed Wednesday’s contest due to a minor right ankle sprain, though it doesn’t appear to be a long-term issue. Bronny has played in the Lakers’ last four preseason games. He had seven points and four rebounds in Tuesday’s loss to the Phoenix Suns. Dončić is fine, but the Lakers simply held him out from a back-to-back outing in the preseason — something that was largely expected. Dončić had 25 points and seven rebounds while shooting 7-of-15 from the field in Tuesday’s contest in Arizona. The Lakers were also without Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton, Jake LaRavia and Marcus Smart on Wednesday. Jarred Vanderbilt was ruled out of the second half of the game with a quad contusion. The Lakers will host the Mavericks first on Nov. 28, then Dončić and the Lakers will head to Dallas on Jan. 24. By then, assuming the elder James is back to full strength and Flagg has settled into his role in the league, we should have a real matchup to get excited for."}

Murray has played his way into becoming a key part of whatever comes next in Sacramento. On Wednesday, the Kings rewarded him by agreeing to a five-year, $140 million contract extension, a story broken by Shams Charania of ESPN and since confirmed by other sources. This is a straight five years, no options. That averages out to about $28 million a season, a number that feels in line with what he deserves in this market, but the Kings believe could be a great deal for them if he lives up to his full potential. Murray is out to start this season, having suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb, which likely means he’ll miss around 10 games, maybe more. That’s a real blow because Murray is the best defensive forward Sacramento has, the guy who often gets the toughest perimeter defensive assignments, and the team doesn’t really have anyone to replace him. When he does return, both Murray and the Kings’ coaches have said that with Dennis Schroder now at the point in Sacramento, Murray will be chasing fewer small guards around and can focus on defending wings, a more natural position for him. Last season, Murray averaged 12.4 points and 6.7 rebounds a game, numbers that were a step back from his sophomore season (15.2 points and 5.5 rebounds, plus basically a steal and a block per game). That regression had more to do with the Kings’ additions of Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan — two other players on the wing who take a lot of shots — than it does with Murray’s development.

Keegan Murray got his deal. The Sacramento Kings reached a five-year, $140 million rookie extension with Murray on Wednesday afternoon, according to ESPN's Shams Charania . [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Murray has been eligible for his rookie extension this fall. He and the Kings had an Oct. 21 deadline to get the deal done. He was entering the final year of his initial four-year, $36.3 million deal. The Kings selected Murray with the No. 4 overall draft pick out of Iowa in 2022. He has averaged 13.3 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 37% from the 3-point line throughout his career. That performance projected him for an extension in line with the four-year, $112 million deal Trey Murphy III received from the New Orleans Pelicans or the five-year, $185 million package Alperen Şengün signed with the Houston Rockets . Over his three seasons, the Kings have declined from the third-best team in the Western Conference to a ninth-place finish in the past two years. Last season, Sacramento qualified for the play-in tournament. In 2024, the Kings defeated the Golden State Warriors before being eliminated by the New Orleans Pelicans. Last season, Sacramento lost to the Dallas Mavericks. Murray has never been more than the Kings' fourth-leading scorer. He was playing alongside high-volume scorers like DeMar DeRozan (22.2 ppg) and Zach LaVine (22.4 ppg) last season and that will continue this campaign. He set an NBA record for 3-pointers made by a rookie with 206, shooting 41%. Perhaps that was an outlier and his numbers were bound to decline. Murray has also been the team's second-leading rebounder behind Domantas Sabonis. Perhaps most importantly, Murray has improved defensively as his career has progressed. He's been especially effective in isolation situations , often against some of the NBA's top scorers, including Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić and Donovan Mitchell. Murray will miss the start of the season while recovering from a torn UCL in his left thumb . He's expected to be sidelined for four-to-six weeks, which has him on target for a return in late November. The extension with Murray is the second significant move the Kings made Wednesday. They also reached a deal to bring in veteran guard Russell Westbrook on a one-year, $3.6 million contract. The Kings open the regular season Oct. 22 against the Phoenix Suns."}

Fantasy Points Per Minute — or FPPM — might be the most overlooked statistic in fantasy basketball, yet it's one of the most powerful tools for evaluating player value. In a game increasingly driven by pace, efficiency and analytics, FPPM provides one simple but crucial insight: how much fantasy production a player delivers every minute they're on the floor. FPPM remains a staple of DFS players, and applying it to a season-long format adds a valuable data point to consider when evaluating the boom potential in fantasy basketball. It's as simple as it sounds. Take a player's average fantasy points per game and divide them by their average minutes, or take the total amount of fantasy points and divide by their total minutes played. Boom — you've got a stat that tells you how much a guy actually produces when he's on the floor. A player putting up 30 fantasy points in 25 minutes? That's a 1.2 FPPM — really good. Someone who needs 35 minutes to get those same 30 points? That's a 0.85 FPPM — not so good. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] And that difference matters — a lot. Especially if you're playing Yahoo's High Score format , where only a player's best game of the week counts. In that setup, upside is king. You want volatility. You want players who can blow up on a random Tuesday and help win your week. That's where high-FPPM guys come in. Players like Tari Eason, who averaged 1.17 FPPM, ranked in the 91st percentile among forwards who play 25 minutes per game. Any time he sees starter-level minutes, you can expect some boom performances. Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Victor Wembanyama all sat comfortably around 1.7 FPPM, which is absurd. They're not just good; they're walking cheat codes. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Anthony Davis weren't far behind — every minute they're on the court means something. Zion Williamson is one of my biggest targets in High Score because his production is calculated once per week, and his ceiling is as high as some first-round talents, at 1.56 FPPM. Even players who entered first-round consideration this year (Cade Cunningham at 1.37 FPPM) had a strong signal that they're trending toward making that next leap as a fantasy producer. Meanwhile, heavy and steady-minute players like Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby? They're fine in standard points leagues — they'll give you 35 minutes, but with middling production across categories. But in High Score, that steadiness is more of a ceiling cap. Their sub-0.9 FPPM marks show they don't spike often enough to move the needle. Are they worthwhile fantasy assets? Yes, because the opportunity size needs are a relevant factor; however, there are likely better options for ceiling outcomes within the same range as their respective ADPs. Now, FPPM isn't a catch-all stat. You still need to consider usage, pace, role, volume and opportunity. But if you're trying to find players who maximize their time — and who can deliver those week-winning outbursts — FPPM is a valuable metric that can help predict and highlight players who are taking advantage of their time on the court. Because in fantasy basketball, it's not about who plays the most minutes — it's about who does the most with them."}

That hope was extinguished midway through the first quarter, when Jaylen Brown grabbed at the back of his left leg and checked out of the game shortly thereafter. Brown headed straight to the locker room, and after a lengthy wait, the team announced that he was doubtful to return due to left hamstring tightness. While Brown did not return to the game -- a surprisingly thrilling 110-108 win over the Raptors -- head coach Joe Mazzulla expressed confidence that it won't be a serious situation for his star. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! \"I think he'll be OK,\" Mazzulla said. \"I just talked to him after [the game], he said he'll be fine, but I didn't get a full update.\" Brown, 28, is in line to be the clear-cut No. 1 leader for the Celtics on and off the court this year, with Jayson Tatum sidelined indefinitely as he recovers from Achilles surgery. Brown started his preseason in alpha mode, scoring a game-high 21 points in 20 minutes in a victory in Memphis. Brown didnt' play in the second preseason game, but he scored eight points with six assists and five rebounds in Sunday's win over Cleveland. Prior to exiting Wednesday's game, he had seven points, two rebounds and a steal in his seven minutes on the floor. A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) While the injury -- and Mazzulla's postgame report -- did not seem serious, there won't be too much time for Brown to fully recover before the regular season begins. The Celtics kick things off on Wednesday, Oct. 22, at home against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Celtics will then head out on a three-game road trip -- to New York, Detroit and New Orleans -- before returning home to host the Cavaliers on Oct. 29. With a week to go before the regular season tips off, the biggest question will be whether or not Brown is ready to go for the opener."}

Brogdon released this statement to the network: “Today, I officially begin my transition out of my basketball career. I have proudly given my mind, body, and spirit to the game over the last few decades. With the many sacrifices it took to get here, I have received many rewards. I am deeply grateful to have arrived to this point on my own terms and now to be able to reap the benefits of my career with my family and friends. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all who have had a place in my journey.” This retirement comes as a surprise. Brogdon was in the Knicks training camp on a non-guaranteed contract but had performed well and was expected to make the final roster. However, in a career where he often battled injuries, Brogdon realized he was not up for the physical and mental demands of another NBA season. With New York hard-capped at the second apron, it had to make a move if it wanted to keep both Brogdon and Landry Shamet (and the Knicks explored the trade market for Pacome Dadiet to clear the space). In the end, Brogdon made the decision for them. Brogdon was a second-round pick of the Bucks in 2016, but won Rookie of the Year averaging 10.2 points and 4.8 assists a game because he was playing meaningful minutes for a Bucks team that make the playoffs as the No. 6 seed (this was the season Joel Embiid was clearly the best rookie, light years ahead of the field, but played in only 31 games due to injury, leaving voters with a difficult choice; Dario Saric was second in the voting that season, Embiid third). In 2023, Brogdon won Sixth Man of the Year for the Celtics, averaging 14.9 points and 4.2 assists a game, providing a needed steady hand with the second unit on a 57-win team. That season summed up Brogdon’s career — he was rock solid on both ends of the court and coaches trusted him. For his career, Brogdon averaged 15.3 points, 4.7 assists, and 4.1 rebounds a game. Brogdon’s career was slowed by injuries — dating back to him being red-flagged before the draft due to foot issues — and he had played just 24 games last season in Washington and 39 the season before that. The Knicks now have to decide which training camp invitee gets the final roster spot, Shamet or Garrison Mathews A Division of NBCUniversal .

He had played in four preseason games with the team this fall, most recently on Monday night against the Washington Wizards. Brogdon played at Virginia from 2011-2016, where he earned consensus first-team All American honors as a senior. The Milwaukee Bucks then selected him with the No. 36 overall pick in 2016, and he spent his first three seasons in the league with the franchise. He was dealt to the Indiana Pacers after three seasons, and he spent another three years there before bouncing around repeatedly in recent years. Brogdon spent a season with both the Boston Celtics and Portland Trail Blazers before landing with the Wizards last season, where he averaged 12.7 points and 4.1 assists in just 24 games while dealing with multiple injuries. In total, Brogdon averaged 15.3 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game throughout his career. He earned Rookie of the Year honors in 2017 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 2023 when he was with the Boston Celtics. The Knicks, who reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years earlier this spring, will open the regular season under new head coach Mike Brown on Oct. 22 against the Cleveland Cavaliers."}

Check out the full results and key takeaways.", "body": "We’re less than a week away from regular season NBA basketball! The 2025-26 NBA season tips off on NBC and Peacock with a doubleheader on October 21 , as the Lakers face the Warriors and the Rockets face the Thunder. As we navigate the final week of the preseason, the Rotoworld crew got together to host a 12-team, 9-category mock draft with some of the best and brightest minds in the fantasy basketball industry. 1. Zak Hanshew - Rotoworld 2. Nick Shlain - Rotoworld 3. Josh Lloyd - Basketball Monster 4. Eric Samulski - Rotoworld 5. Dan Besbris - Old Man Squad Sports Network 6. Raphiell Johnson - Rotoworld 7. George Bissell - Rotoworld 8. Alex Barutha - Rotowire 9. Dan Titus - Yahoo! Sports 10. Noah Rubin - Rotoworld 11. Adam King - Fantasy Basketball International 12. Papi Roi - Fantasy Basketball Philippines Podcast Below are the results of our draft with some thoughts and analysis. Why did I take Wemby over Jokic? Which picks were surprising in each round? How early did Cooper Flagg get selected? And which late-round pick did I make to prompt Raphielle Johnson to tell me he hated me? If you want to watch the entire draft shake out, you can check it out here . 1. Victor Wembanyama (SAS - C) 2. Nikola Jokić (DEN - C) 3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC - PG) 4. Luka Dončić (LAL - PG,SG) 5. Anthony Edwards (MIN - PG,SG) 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL - PF,C) 7. Anthony Davis (DAL - PF,C) 8. Cade Cunningham (DET - PG,SG) 9. Devin Booker (PHX - PG,SG) 10. James Harden (LAC - PG,SG) 11. Trae Young (ATL - PG) 12. Karl-Anthony Towns (NYK - PF,C) There’s a two or three-man debate for the top overall pick in fantasy hoops this season. Nikola Jokic and Victor Wembanyama are the clear top options, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander working his way into the mix. I went Wemby here, banking on upside rather than consistency and floor with Jokic. Wembanyama has yet to stay healthy for a full season, and he’s not as effective as Jokic as a facilitator. We’ve probably seen the best of Joker after last season’s triple-double average, but the best is yet to come for Wembanyama. There were a couple of surprises in the first round, as Ant-Man went right after SGA and Luka. Cade Cunningham was a big riser after a breakout 2024-25 campaign, and James Harden ’s inclusion in the top-10 highlights his lasting impact on the game so late into his career. As Raphielle mentioned during the draft, picking in the 5-7 range is particularly difficult, but he was able to get a steal with Giannis at No. 6 after Edwards surprisingly went one pick before that. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Tyrese Maxey (PHI - PG) 3. Stephen Curry (GSW - PG) 4. Donovan Mitchell (CLE - PG,SG) 5. Kevin Durant (HOU - SF,PF) 6. Jalen Johnson (ATL - SF,PF) 7. Evan Mobley (CLE - PF,C) 8. Domantas Sabonis (SAC - C) 9. Josh Giddey (CHI - PG,SG) 10. Alperen Sengun (HOU - C) 11. Jalen Brunson (NYK - PG) 12. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) Thompson is perhaps the biggest riser in 2025-26 fantasy drafts compared to where he was selected in 2024-25. Last season, Thompson was an afterthought in the realm of fantasy hoops, but he’s now a consensus first or second-rounder. Jalen Johnson is another guy fantasy managers hope can replicate his breakout success from a season ago. Ditto Josh Giddey, who was written off after his final season in OKC but found new life with the Bulls. Is Alperen Sengun ready to take a leap in 2025-26? He was tremendous a season ago, and he looked even better at EuroBasket. Grabbing him at the end of the second round could prove to be a big-time value if he continues to ascend. 1. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 2. Scottie Barnes (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 3. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 4. Pascal Siakam (IND - PF,C) 5. Derrick White (BOS - PG,SG) 6. Jamal Murray (DEN - PG,SG) 7. Dyson Daniels (ATL - PG,SG,SF) 8. Chet Holmgren (OKC - PF,C) 9. Bam Adebayo (MIA - PF,C) 10. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 11. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 12. Jaren Jackson Jr. (MEM - PF,C) I grabbed Jalen Williams at the end of the second round and paired him with Paolo Banchero at the turn. As Noah pointed out in the draft, Banchero’s lack of defensive stats will be offset by Williams and Wemby. I’m a big fan of Banchero’s, and he could be in for a monster season. He was trending up in a big way before getting hurt last season, and a fully healthy campaign could be monstrous. I love his dual eligibility as a PF and C. The third round is where things started to get pretty interesting. No surprises in Scottie Barnes and LaMelo Ball . Raphielle played it safe with Jamal Murray , who’s been a steady, yet unremarkable contributor throughout his career. Dyson Daniels and Derrick White have rocketed up draft boards thanks to elite production (Daniels) and increased opportunity (White). Porzingis here is a dice roll given his health, but he’s been a great per-game contributor when available. The first rookie came off the board as Noah got his guy in Cooper Flagg. How high can Flagg rise in fantasy hoops this season? He should see a ton of playing time, and he offers elite production on both ends of the floor. 1. De’Aaron Fox (SAS - PG,SG) 2. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 3. Franz Wagner (ORL - SF,PF) 4. Ja Morant (MEM - PG) 5. Deni Avdija (POR - SF,PF) 6. Jaylen Brown (BOS - SG,SF) 7. Trey Murphy III (NOP - SF,PF) 8. Kawhi Leonard (LAC - SF,PF) 9. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 10. Coby White (CHI - PG,SG) 11. Ivica Zubac (LAC - C) 12. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) De’Aaron Fox is certainly a gamble here, as he’ll be sidelined to open up the season due to a hamstring injury. LeBron James will miss the first season-opener of his career, so Austin Reaves could be in line for a massive bump in usage. Reaves went seven picks before James in this draft, which is the most fascinating tidbit of the fourth round. Is James’ sciatica going to limit him in Year 23? Coby White this early is too rich for my blood, especially with Josh Giddey running point guard. Ivica Zubac is another guy I wouldn’t be comfortable taking in this range due to LA’s offseason roster moves. I rolled the dice once again with the final pick of this round … 1. Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 2. Desmond Bane (ORL - SG,SF) 3. Myles Turner (MIL - C) 4. Jalen Duren (DET - C) 5. Jimmy Butler III (GSW - SF,PF) 6. Darius Garland (CLE - PG) 7. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 8. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 9. Jarrett Allen (CLE - C) 10. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 11. OG Anunoby (NYK - SF,PF) 12. Payton Pritchard (BOS - PG) I’m usually opposed to drafting Joel Embiid at all, but getting him at Pick 48 was just way too good to pass up. He missed a ton of time last season and struggled to post elite numbers when on the court. He’s been ramping up activity recently and could be available for the season-opener. When at his best, Embiid is a 30/10/5 guy who can shoot threes and block shots. That’s incredible value with a huge question mark. Next up is another injury-prone player, Zion Williamson . Williamson has gotten in better shape during the offseason, and his elite skillset could make him another incredible value. I could have a league-winning pair in Rounds 4-5, or I could have my IL spots filled up quickly. Go big, or go home! Myles Turner feels like a great value here, but taking Jalen Duren is a bit risky given Detroit’s depth. The round wrapped up without too many surprises. Payton Pritchard is a huge riser given Boston’s shallow depth at multiple positions. Will he be a starter or push for 30 minutes off the bench? 1. Immanuel Quickley (TOR - PG,SG) 2. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 3. Brandon Ingram (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 4. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 5. Zach LaVine (SAC - PG,SG) 6. Walker Kessler (UTA - C) 7. Michael Porter Jr. (BKN - SF,PF) 8. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 9. DeMar DeRozan (SAC - SF) 10. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 11. Josh Hart (NYK - SG,SF,PF) 12. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) A pair of Raptors went off the board here, as Immanuel Quickley will look to put together a fully-healthy season and stuff the stat sheet on a nightly basis. Brandon Ingram could return to form, especially if Toronto utilizes him more as an outside threat. Several centers went in this round, and Jakob Poeltl is one of my favorite later-round options at the position. A pair of Nets also came off the board, as Michael Porter Jr. went at Pick 7, and I grabbed my man Cam Thomas at Pick 12. He should be playing for pride and his next contract, giving an added boost to an already promising outlook. Assuming he can stay healthy in 2025-26, I’m counting on Thomas to build on the breakout he had at the end of the 2023-24 season and into the 2024-25 campaign. 1. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) 2. Julius Randle (MIN - PF,C) 3. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 4. Christian Braun (DEN - SG,SF) 5. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 6. Paul George (PHI - SG,SF,PF) 7. Jalen Green (PHX - PG,SG) 8. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 9. Rudy Gobert (MIN - C) 10. Donovan Clingan (POR - C) 11. Norman Powell (MIA - SG,SF) 12. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) I was short on guards, so I nabbed Shaedon Sharpe with the first pick of Round 7. He’s been getting a ton of praise from coaches and teammates, and a breakout season could be on tap. Not too many surprises in this round, other than Alex Sarr . He had a strong rookie campaign, and Washington’s center depth is thinner than it was a season ago. Is he ready for a breakout, or is a sophomore slump going to disappoint fantasy managers? Paul George wasn’t great last season when on the court, but there’s only one way to go from here, right? Getting him so late in a draft should offset the injury risk. Ausar Thompson was selected with the third pick. Like his twin Amen (drafted in the second round), he’s a player pegged for a potential breakout. 1. Matas Buzelis (CHI - SF,PF) 2. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 3. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 4. Cameron Johnson (DEN - SF,PF) 5. Mark Williams (PHX - C) 6. Kel’el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 7. Bennedict Mathurin (IND - SG,SF) 8. John Collins (LAC - PF,C) 9. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 10. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 11. Anfernee Simons (BOS - PG,SG) 12. CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) Here’s where we started seeing some swings, but there was a ton of potential value in Round 8. Matas Buzelis is a risk/reward option who has become an analyst favorite in the offseason. Mark Williams and Tyler Herro could be excellent values, but availability is a major concern, given their current injuries and Williams’ extensive history of missing time. Kel’el Ware has had a phenomenal preseason, but can he parlay that success into an elite regular season run? Benedict Mathurin should see a ton of playing time in 2025-26, but can he provide more than just points? 1. Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 2. RJ Barrett (TOR - SF,PF) 3. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 4. Isaiah Hartenstein (OKC - C) 5. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 6. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 7. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 8. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 9. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 10. Zach Edey (MEM - C) 11. Bradley Beal (LAC - SG,SF) 12. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) I needed a player with PG eligibility, so I took McCollum in Round 8 and Suggs in Round 9. I’m not thrilled with either selection, but both should see enough usage to provide value in this range. Draymond Green , Jaden Ivey , Reed Sheppard , and RJ Barrett are some of the least exciting selections here. You know what you’re getting with Green, but it’s not a ton at this point in his career. Still, you can’t find a triple-double threat this late in drafts anywhere else. Ivey, Sheppard and Barrett are big risks given uncertain roles for the first two and questions about Barrett’s production outside of scoring. 1. Dereck Lively II (DAL - C) 2. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 3. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 4. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 5. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 6. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 7. Keegan Murray (SAC - SF,PF) 8. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 9. D’Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 10. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 11. Jrue Holiday (POR - PG,SG) 12. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) We’re really into big swing territory here. D’Angelo Russell could be a huge value as Dallas’ de facto starting PG until Kyrie Irving returns. Tobias Harris and Jrue Holiday have offered elite production over the years, and even in the autumn of their careers, they should certainly offer enough here to be worth a late-round selection. 1. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 2. Aaron Gordon (DEN - PF,C) 3. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 4. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) 5. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 6. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 7. Jayson Tatum (BOS - SF,PF) 8. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 9. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 10. Isaiah Jackson (IND - C) 11. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 12. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) I selected Kyshawn George at the end of Round 10. He’s one of my guys for the 2025-26 season, and I’m expecting strong, two-way production. Ace Bailey is another guy who has impressed in the preseason. Strong play and plenty of opportunities for the rebuilding Jazz give him tremendous upside. The most notable pick of this round is Jayson Tatum , who has said that he wants to try playing this season. Even if he’s able to take the court for a few games, he’ll be sitting in one of your IL spots all season until he maybe returns . 1. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 2. Khris Middleton (WAS - SF,PF) 3. Kyrie Irving (DAL - PG) 4. Nikola Jović (MIA - PF) 5. Collin Sexton (CHA - PG,SG) 6. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 7. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 8. Neemias Queta (BOS - PF,C) 9. Cam Whitmore (WAS - SF,PF) 10. De’Andre Hunter (CLE - SF,PF) 11. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 12. Ryan Kalkbrenner (CHA - C) Kyrie Irving will presumably be out until at least the All-Star break. How much can he offer when he returns? Two more rookies came off the board as VJ Edgecombe went to Raphielle, and I selected Ryan Kalkbrenner . Raphielle is high on Kalkbrenner too, and my selection here caused him to tell me he hated me. Strong words, but hey, I got my guy. 1. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 2. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 3. Chris Boucher (BOS - PF,C) 4. Adem Bona (PHI - C) 5. Kelly Oubre Jr. (PHI - SF,PF) 6. Ayo Dosunmu (CHI - SG,SF) 7. Sam Hauser (BOS - SF,PF) 8. Mitchell Robinson (NYK - C) 9. Brice Sensabaugh (UTA - SF,PF) 10. Keon Ellis (SAC - PG,SG) - Rubin 11. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 12. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) The final round is all about upside, and that’s what I expect with Kuminga. If the Warriors are truly intent on trading him during the season, they’ll have to showcase him, which means a consistent role and strong production. Chris Boucher could end up the starting center for Boston, making him a nice pick here. Adem Bona could do the same for the 76ers if (who are we kidding - when ) Embiid is forced to miss time. Sam Hauser should see an increased role for the shorthanded Celtics, and someone’s got to step up for Sacramento. Three - yes three - Kings guards went off the board here. Someone’s got a reliable fantasy option, right? Could the Knicks utilize a jumbo lineup with Karl-Anthony Towns playing alongside Mitchell Robinson ? Even if Robinson comes off the bench, he should see enough playing time to be a viable option, and getting him in the final round is a tremendous value. The draft closed out with another injured player. Dejounte Murray is an elite, multi-cat contributor, but he’ll have to sit in an IL spot until at least January. 1. (1) Victor Wembanyama (SAS - C) 2. (24) Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. (25) Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. (48) Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 5. (49) Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 6. (72) Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 7. (73) Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) 8. (96) CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) 9. (97) Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 10. (120) Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. (121) Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 12. (144) Ryan Kalkbrenner (CHA - C) 13. (145) Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) Strengths: Defense, rebounding, FG% Weaknesses: Three-pointers, assists, availability I rolled the dice many times in this draft, but this team is on-brand. I love drafting for upside rather than security, and typically, I’m inclined to draft younger players over veterans. There are breakout options all across my final roster, and if guys like Embiid, Williamson, Thomas and Sharpe can stay mostly healthy, this team could win many, many weeks.

The Sacramento Kings have fully returned to \"Kangz\" territory by agreeing to a deal with former MVP Russell Westbrook . Arguably the league's weirdest roster just got weirder, and at this point, it's fair to wonder out loud if Westbrook is even an asset on the floor. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Westbrook has spent the past few seasons in decline, gathering stats like candy but not necessarily putting his teams in advantageous positions. The 6-foot-3 lead guard remains a notoriously streaky shooter and one of the least efficient shooters in league history based on volume, shooting 30.5% on almost 4,500 career 3-point attempts. There are intriguing elements to his game, such as his ability to still get downhill and turn on the jets. He remains a formidable rebounder, even if a portion of his boards are basically gift-wrapped by teammates boxing out in the right positions and allowing him to swoop in and grab them. His court vision has never been as good as his assist totals, which is underlined by his high turnover rate. However, he does have the capacity of making good reads, and he occasionally understands how to leverage his athleticism. All that said, does he really help the Kings, a team that operates in between the realms of mediocrity and sheer panic? If anything, he adds to their complexity, and not in a good way. His bang-bang plays will give them highlights, and his inconsistent defense will lose them games. You be the judge of what's more important. But getting back to the gravity — or lack thereof — that's the main issue. Westbrook as an off-ball floor-spacer is simply not a threat, and defenses are well aware of that and will play him for the drive. Will the 36-year-old have games wherein he channels some of his former glory? Yes, absolutely. But that only makes it that much more frustrating, especially for a Kings team that's looking for consistency. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] The Kings have both DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis, neither of whom is a great 3-point shooter but both deserving of minutes regardless. If the Kings decide to throw those two and Westbrook on the floor, defenses will basically be able to park the bus and dare that trio to hurt them with outside looks. This Kings roster is, frankly, all over the place, and Westbrook's play style, which dictates that he is essentially the focal point when on the floor, feels like an almost unrealistically bad fit. One way to get out of that is by simply playing Westbrook less than ever before, but history is a tough sell on that part, as he seems to keep managing to find himself playing more than 25 minutes per game — a number that should be considered almost extreme with this roster. If anything, Westbrook should play the vast majority of his minutes alongside Zach LaVine in the backcourt in an attempt to provide him with the necessary slashing lanes to be more useful. Can this experiment work? It seems far-fetched. Westbrook would essentially have to break patterns he's spent 17 seasons on six teams exercising. There isn't exactly a rich history of players suddenly embracing team defense and offering total buy-in at almost 37 years old. The Kings are seemingly banking on his ability to adapt, which, given his eternal reluctance, is sort of like expecting Giancarlo Esposito to turn down acting jobs. As such, we have to approach this new marriage with a big old case of realism. There will be ups, there will be plenty of downs, and there will be a ton of games where his performance falls somewhere in-between. If the Kings are aware of that, fine. But it doesn't seem ambitious."}

Westbrook and the Kings have agreed to a one-year deal, a story broken by ESPN’s Shams Charania and since confirmed by other reports. The deal is expected to become official on Thursday. While the financial terms are not yet public, this is likely a fully guaranteed deal for the veteran minimum of $3.6 million (keeping the Kings $1.8 million below the luxury tax line). Westbrook had not picked up his $3.5 million player option with Denver and became a free agent. Westbrook, 37, averaged 13.3 points and 6.1 assists a game last season in Denver. What he brings nightly is energy that can change games — even at this age, nobody plays harder than Westbrook every night. However, he’s not an efficient scorer at this point in his career, nor is he a great defender. The Kings needed depth at the point behind Dennis Schroder, and Westbrook slides right into that role. While the Kings have high hopes for him, and just exercised the third-year option on him, second-year point guard Devin Carter did not seem ready for the leap yet. Sacramento will have a bench unit with Westbrook, Malik Monk and Doug McDermott behind a starting five of Schroder, Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan and Keon Ellis.

Russell Westbrook has reportedly agreed to sign a contract with the Sacramento Kings, according to ESPN's Shams Charania , as the former NBA Most Valuable Player and nine-time All-Star/All-NBA selection returns for an 18th season. The deal is reportedly for one year and $3.6 million, per Chris Haynes. Westbrook, 36, averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game across 75 appearances, including 36 starts, for the Denver Nuggets last season. He was one of just 17 NBA players to hit those marks — a list laden with All-Star, All-NBA and MVP candidates. That’s the sort of rarefied air through which Westbrook traveled throughout his years in Oklahoma City, first with and then without Kevin Durant. As his career has winded its way through various outposts over the past half-decade — through stints with Houston, Washington and both L.A. franchises before landing alongside Nikola Jokić in Denver — and his shooting efficiency has waned while his turnover rate waxes, Westbrook has transitioned from the ranks of franchise-cornerstone superstar into being something of a tricky fit on would-be contending rosters. He can still be a productive one, though, as evidenced by his mutually beneficial pairing with Jokić this season — one capable of outperforming the veteran minimum salaries he’s played on over the past few seasons, and even producing in the postseason. Westbrook still brings inarguable verve on every possession, helping juice his team’s transition frequency with end-to-end forays off steals and defensive rebounds. Even as the odometer ticks up, he can still operate in the pick-and-roll, find creases in the defense and get to the cup, taking well over 40% of his field goal attempts at the rim last season and converting 64% of them, his highest rate since 2021 . Playing more frequently off the ball alongside Jokić last season, he also showed some facility with migrating his game a bit more away from the middle of the floor, making a career-high 45 corner 3s last season — more than he had in the previous two seasons combined — at a 42% clip . And he’s still able to crank it up come springtime, as he did in Denver’s opening-round win over the Clippers team that traded him away last offseason to set the stage for him joining the Nuggets: But while Westbrook was critical to Denver’s first-round win over the Clippers, he was costly in Round 2 against Oklahoma City, shooting just 34.8% from the field and 21.9% from 3-point range with more turnovers (18) than assists (17) in 160 minutes — during which the Nuggets were outscored by 92 points, far and away the worst plus-minus of any player in the conference semifinals . After the Thunder eliminated the Clippers, Westbrook had surgery to repair two broken bones in his shooting hand . The gift and the curse of Westbrook’s game — the inimitable fire with which he plays, and the danger that it will sometimes get a little out of control and burn you — has made him one of the NBA’s most compelling figures for nearly two decades. Now, it makes him an intriguing gamble for teams looking to fill roles in free agency: a potential high-risk, high-reward signing whose shaky jumper and turnover problems can submarine a second unit, but whose intensity, rim pressure, durability and years of high-level experience can still bring plenty of value for a team looking for a fresh jolt of energy and attitude."}

That job offer didn’t materialize, and the Knicks ultimately leaned into a veteran NBA coach in Mike Brown. At SEC media day , Staley was direct and honest in saying she didn’t expect to see a female head NBA coach in her lifetime. “I don’t. And I hope I’m wrong,” Staley said. Staley said she took the interview with New York because of the relationship she has with Knicks president Leon Rose. “I did the Knicks interview because I’ve known Leon Rose for 30 years,” Staley said. “I have a connection to him and Worldwide Wes. I’ve known them all my life. It was a real interview, and I like to see what they’re talking about.” Staley also got into the details of the challenges both the coach and the organization that someday hires a woman coach would face. “If I’m the Knicks coach and you have a five-game losing streak, it’s not going to be about the losing streak. It’s going to be about being a female coach,” Staley said. “So you as an organization and a franchise, you have to be prepared about that and strong enough to endure those types of instances when you’re a female coach.” Staley has a resume that should get her seriously considered for an NBA job. She has led the South Carolina women to three NCAA titles and coached the USA women to a gold medal in the Tokyo Olympics. All that is on top of being an eight-time WNBA All-Star and a three-time Olympic gold medalist as a player.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 52-30 (second in West, lost to the Warriors in the first round) Offensive rating : 114.9 (12th) Defensive rating : 110.3 (5th) Additions : Kevin Durant, Dorian Finney-Smith, Clint Capela Subtractions : Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Jock Landale Complete roster When the Rockets acquired Kevin Durant over the summer, the on-paper fit seemed exquisite. Houston’s half-court playoff struggles against an experienced Golden State unit boiled down to a glaring lack of a bona fide go-to scorer, a supreme spacer and an alpha male. Adding Durant (who represents all of the aforementioned qualities) to the group, even at the cost of two starters, was a no-brainer move for general manager Rafael Stone. Last week’s preseason debut for Durant — an efficient 20-point night on 7-for-10 shooting in 23 minutes — was a reminder of the sheer quality the 14-time All-Star brings any time he laces his sneakers up. It was apparent that this was the first real game Durant was playing with his new teammates, but he linked up well with Alperen Şengün and provided a safety valve for Amen Thompson and Reed Sheppard as they continue to develop chemistry together. Head coach Ime Udoka, notorious for his phlegmatic postgame pressers, almost ran out of complimentary words for the future Hall of Famer. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] \"Consistent scoring threat,\" Udoka said. \"Finisher, closer, however you want to put it. We know what he does, he's done it his whole career so it will be a benefit for us. That was the driving force [to acquire him].\" But how long can Durant stay healthy? In a perfect world, we would have the luxury of watching our superstars every night, every week, over an 82-game season. That unfortunately hasn’t been the case with Durant, who has played 70 games or more only once in the past five years. It’s a laundry list of injuries over the years — Achilles tear, hamstring strain, MCL sprain in both knees and nagging ankle issues — that forces us to reconcile with the harsh realities of the basketball gods. Just a few weeks ago, the Rockets lost starting point guard Fred VanVleet for the season with a torn right ACL, which threw their playmaking plans into disarray. Durant is an experienced (and somehow underrated) secondary creator who in theory can work alongside Şengün in the half-court, and Houston is still trying to aid Sheppard's and Thompson’s growth as distributors as well. Udoka is using the remainder of the preseason as a dress rehearsal for their season opener against the champs, but the various lineup combinations deployed already suggest that Durant may be shouldering more playmaking load than he had anticipated. For better or for worse, this is the group this front office is married to for the next few years. Houston’s cap sheet is a bit rigid now, thanks to extensions for key members of its core — and Durant and Tari Eason are still unsigned at the time of this writing. There’s also the overarching theme of Houston’s new two-timeline approach, juxtaposed with chasing Oklahoma City (and Denver, to a lesser degree). The move for Durant firmly established the Rockets’ aim to win and develop now, but is that enough to compete with the reigning champs? Oklahoma City’s unprecedented Finals run highlighted the importance of depth and versatility. Houston, with Durant under center, now has the same goals and believes it has comparable talent. [ Get more Rockets news: Houston team feed ] All things considered, this was the best time to acquire Durant. Houston’s spacing issues were jarring last season, finishing 20th in 3-point attempts, 22nd in 3-point makes and 21st in 3-point percentage — and now has one of the greatest shooters of all time. Defensively, Durant’s length and smarts are enough to maintain Udoka’s aggressive scheme, allowing the 37-year-old to fixate on weaker offensive opposition in man defense and roam in zone. The Rockets’ desperation for a title would see them make this move a hundred times over, no matter the circumstances. Durant’s availability, and his ability to raise Houston’s ceiling, will be the deciding factors in 2025-26. Şengün takes “The Leap.” The Turkish big man has worked tirelessly this summer, working on becoming more comfortable around the perimeter, and gives the Rockets an additional weapon in the half-court. Houston’s next-man up point guard approach isn’t Thompson, Sheppard or even Durant with all due respect. It’s Şengün as a half-court hub. The Nikola Jokić comparisons become less of a faint possibility and more of a reality. The tandem with Durant — along with improvement from Thompson, Smith, Eason, and Sheppard — carries the Rockets all the way to the NBA Finals in June. The Durant adjustment takes longer than expected, causing a negative trickle-down effect. Houston’s half-court woes become exacerbated with Durant attempting to establish himself as the lead dog at the expense of Thompson and Şengün. The Rockets’ lack of a true point guard continues to punish them through December, when they are forced to look for outside help at the cost of a key piece. Their talent is enough to get them to the playoffs, but a swift first-round exit has management reevaluating everything. Alternatively, Durant missing a significant amount of time puts Houston’s spacing issues back at square one. Opposing teams now have enough film and data on Udoka’s double-big lineups and can use their perceived strength as a glaring weakness. Season opener : Oct. 21 at Oklahoma City Complete schedule The Rockets won 52 games last season in a crowded conference, but most of their underlying stats painted them as a traditional sixth or seventh 47-ish wins team. Durant is about as good of a Band-Aid as there is, but at least seven of the eight playoff and play-in teams Houston finished above improved this offseason as well. Getting to 53 or 54 wins, especially without VanVleet, would be a huge accomplishment.

Atlanta pushed its chips into the middle with this group, it wants to see how things look before deciding whether to continue down this road or turn the car around and make a dramatic change. That applies to Porzingis as well, and he sees it the same way. Porzingis is extension eligible, but told Fred Katz of The Athletic there is no push to get a deal done now. “I know that’s an option. I wanna see how the year goes,” Porziņģis said ... “I wanna show that I’m playing at a high level again, that I’m healthy, that I’m everything, and then that kind of stuff will take care of itself, you know? We’ll see ... “I don’t wanna rush anything and say this or that, but I wanna take it one day at a time,” he said. Porzingis is set to make $30.7 million this season in the final year of a two-year, $60 million contract he signed in Boston. This summer, as it looked to cut salary, the Celtics traded Porzingis to the Hawks in a three-team deal with Brooklyn. On paper, Porzingis is exactly the kind of big man Atlanta needed — an impressive rim protector on the defensive end who is a pick-and-pop threat with Young. Last season, Porzingis averaged 19.5 points and 6.8 rebounds a game, shooting 41.2% from 3-point range. He looked good playing for his native Latvia this summer at EuroBasket as well. However, he played in just 42 games last season (due in part to a mysterious virus) and has played in 65 games just once in the previous seven seasons. He needs to show he can stay on the court, availability will have a lot to do with how much his next contract is worth. A contract extension with the Hawks could start as high as $43 million a season, although a number closer to where Porzingis is now — in the $30-35 million range a season — seems more likely if he can stay on the court. If the Hawks live up to the hopes and expectations of fans and the front office this season — top four seed, advancing out of the first round of the playoffs at least — then Porzingis, Young and others are going to get paid this summer and Atlanta is going to continue down the road.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 41-41 (sixth in the East, lost to the Celtics in the first round) Offensive rating : 108.9 (27th) Defensive rating : 109.1 (2nd) Additions: Desmond Bane, Tyus Jones, Jase Richardson, Noah Penda, Orlando Robinson, Jamal Cain Subtractions: Cole Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cory Joseph, Gary Harris, Caleb Houstan Complete roster I’ve written about this a few times over the years, and chances are you’ve heard it on an NBA podcast or broadcast or two: Orlando has not finished in the top half of the league in offensive efficiency since Dwight Howard left the Magic to join the Lakers. That happened in 2012 . Kevin Durant has won four Olympic gold medals since the last time the Magic finished better than 15th in points scored per possession. If I’m counting right, 50 Marvel movies have come and gone from theaters since the last time an Orlando team was mediocre at putting the ball in the basket. There are Central Floridian teenagers who have never seen an average NBA offense up close and personal … unless the visiting team brings one to town. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] If you’re thinking, “Seems like it’d be pretty hard to win very much if you’ve had a bad offense for almost 15 years,” well, that’s because it is: The Magic have made the playoffs just four times in the last 13 seasons , and none of those four playoff runs advanced beyond the opening round. After consecutive postseason appearances in which they produced points at a rate that would’ve finished dead last in the NBA during the regular season — and last year fielding what was, according to the great John Schuhmann , “the worst offensive team … to make the playoffs in the 29 seasons for which we have play-by-play data” — president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman and Co. decided that the time had come to throw caution to the wind. The goal was lofty: Find the perfect complementary piece to build an offense capable of complementing the elite defense that head coach Jamahl Mosley has built in Orlando. The price was even loftier: four unprotected first-round picks . In comes Desmond Bane, a career 41% 3-point shooter who’s 22nd in the NBA in total made triples over the last four seasons , to provide a desperately needed decongestant for an attack that finished dead last in 3-pointers per game and team 3-point accuracy , and 27th in half-court scoring efficiency . Bane has grown significantly over the years as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, complementary playmaker and north-south driver, too, making him a seemingly perfect fit next to max-salaried cornerstones Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner . Bane’s shooting should help widen the driving lanes for the bruising big wings’ forays to the basket. His off-ball movement should help inject some dynamism into a Magic attack that ranked in the middle of the pack in average distance traveled per game on offense last season, and 25th in average speed traveled , according to Second Spectrum. His ability to make something happen with the ball in his hands should reduce their overall shot-creation burden, and the possibilities of him partnering with them in screening actions — including as a screen-setter himself in inverted actions — should open up more opportunities for Orlando to put defenses in a bind. Add in fellow former Grizzly Tyus Jones, who’s shot 39.8% from 3-point range over the last four seasons — and who perpetually ranks at or near the top of the assist-to-turnover ratio leaderboard, which ought to help Orlando’s bottom-third-of-the-league turnover rate — and first-round pick Jase Richardson, who shot 41.2% from the college 3-point line in his lone year at Michigan State (and who’s shown some exciting flashes in preseason ), and Orlando might actually have enough firepower to go toe-to-toe with expected beasts of the East like the Cavaliers and Knicks. Provided, of course, the Magic can keep their big guns on the court. Only three playoff teams (Oklahoma City, Memphis and the Lakers) lost more games due to injury last season than the Magic, according to Spotrac . Banchero and Wagner were both sidelined by torn oblique muscles, while All-Defensive teamer/attitudinal talisman Jalen Suggs was limited to just 35 games by a left knee injury that required season-ending surgery; all told, Orlando’s top three players shared the court for just 97 minutes across just six games last season . The hope is that better health for the three franchise pillars — and continued availability for Bane, who played 69 games last season after missing significant time in each of the previous two seasons in Memphis — will allow the Magic to have the same kind of year-over-year surge that Cleveland enjoyed last season . [ Get more Magic news: Orlando team feed ] The fear is that, with Suggs still not back to full-contact 5-on-5 work more than seven months after surgery , and potentially still “weeks” away from getting back in the fold, we might not get to see the full-strength squad that Orlando’s brass had drawn up for a while. (Key reserve Moe Wagner still being a ways off from returning after tearing the ACL in his left knee last December doesn’t help, either.) That, in turn, could prevent the Magic from developing the sort of chemistry and cohesion critical in creating a potent offense, and impede their expected progress up the Eastern standings. If Banchero, Franz and Bane can quickly find some synergy, though, and if Suggs and Moe are able to return and provide both instant production and their customary pugilistic play, the Magic could have the right sort of recipe to become a team that’s more than the sum of its parts. “I think we should be a deep playoff team,” Banchero recently told Josh Robbins of The Athletic . “Hopefully, that means Finals. But if it’s anything shorter than that, then Eastern Conference finals. I want to play deep into the playoffs.” Sprinkle in increased growth from connective-tissue youngsters like Anthony Black and Tristan da Silva, and efficient interior contributions from big men Wendell Carter Jr. and Goga Bitadze, and Orlando really might have a chance to damage defenses at a league-average level. Combine that with the kind of defense that’s been Orlando’s calling card under Mosley, and the Magic could be the kind of contender that fans have been waiting a very, very long time to see. All of the aforementioned health questions break Orlando’s way, giving Mosley the time, reps and raw materials with which to build a two-way monster; the Magic finish top five in defensive efficiency and top 10 on the other end, exorcising all the demons of terrible offenses past. Banchero, Wagner and Bane all make the All-Star team; Paolo (who takes a leap in his scoring efficiency and inside-out passing) and Franz (who finally irons out the kink in that jumper) make All-NBA; Mosley wins Coach of the Year. Orlando blows past 55 wins, takes the No. 1 seed in the East, and rides a miracle season to the NBA Finals, as Kevin Pelton’s Simulation No. 620 becomes blissful reality. Suggs’ knee is never right and, as a result, neither are the Magic. Banchero, Bane and Wagner all put up good numbers, but without Suggs’ combination of elite point-of-attack defense, secondary playmaking and knockdown spot-up shooting, Mosley can’t quite find the right combinations to be able to field consistently potent two-way lineups without exploitable shortcomings on one end or the other. The offense improves a little, but the defense slips more, and Orlando again finds itself futzing around .500, unable to break through in a conference that once seemed ripe for the taking — and wondering if it’s gone all-in with a hand that ultimately might not be good enough to drag the pot. Season opener : Oct. 22 vs. Miami Complete schedule Orlando has won 52 or more games just four times in franchise history, all led by a transformational Hall of Fame center. There’s no Shaq or Dwight here … but if the injury bug doesn’t bite, there’s enough talent here to be able to approach a mid-50s win total. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • LA Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Who are the top No. 3 options?", "body": "Manage your account ... Anyone can list the best players in the NBA, but basketball is as much about chemistry as it is talent. Within each of the league's 30 teams is a hierarchy, and how well each of the five players on the court understands and performs his role within that hierarchy is every bit as important as his individual skill. While depth was vital to the success of the Thunder and Pacers last season, and we understand coaches often say, \"It's about who closes the game; not who starts it,\" the pursuit of a roster's most cohesive five-man unit is still paramount. Three of last year's top four starting lineups on our list — the Thunder, Knicks and Timberwolves — reached the conference finals. In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Ideally, a lineup has its superstar, a deferential co-star, a third star who owns his role, a fourth option and a fifth starter to tie it all together — clear Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. How close does your team come to an ideal lineup? What is a No. 3? Here is how we described him last year: He is still a star, at least on a good team, but he is sacrificing some faction of his game for the greater good of the team. He usually leans into his greatest skill, whether that is flame-throwing 3s or defending like crazy. Ideally, it is both, and if you ask more from your third star, he answers the call. There is a balance to downsizing your role and remaining as efficient as ever, and it is the third star's responsibility to strike it. Think of Kevin Love on the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers. He arrived from a lottery team in Minnesota, where he was the No. 1 — and an entirely different player at that, doing most of his damage inside of 8 feet — but transitioned into a 3-and-D weapon behind LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The greatest teams in NBA history featured Hall of Fame talents who might have been even more productive on lesser rosters. You know them well: Robert Parish, James Worthy, Dennis Rodman, etc. They managed to understand their positions in the pecking order and find their own ways to thrive in it. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Hey, that's pretty good! Let's stick with it. Consider Draymond Green, whose defensive, playmaking and occasional shooting prowess could thrive in the space created by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson — and now Jimmy Butler in his place — to perpetuate one of the great dynasties in the league's history. Could Green have developed into a star in his own right on any other team? We don't know. And who cares, for he leveraged what skills he does have to star for his team in exactly the way it needed him. Lastly, we sourced these lineups and each player's status within them with beat reporters around the league. We appreciate everyone who casted a roster; there are too many people to thank in this space. And we recognize that not every player listed here will be in an opening-night starting lineup. Injuries occur. Coaches change their minds. But just know that this is our best guess at the rotations we will likely see most often from each team. We've unveiled our rankings of the top No. 1 and No. 2 options. Without further ado, your five best No. 3s ... Holmgren has played 114 regular-season games over the first three years of his career, missing the entirety of his rookie season to a right foot injury and 50 games last season to a fractured right hip. When healthy, though, and he was for all of last season's playoffs, helping the Thunder to the NBA's 2025 championship, Holmgren is among the league's best centers. Playing all 82 games of his sophomore campaign, Holmgren collected 190 blocks and 129 3-point makes, joining Victor Wembanyama, Kristaps Porziņģis, Jaren Jackson Jr., Myles Turner and Brook Lopez as the only players to register at least 100 3s and 100 blocks. Only Lopez converted more 3-pointers, and only Wembanyama registered more blocks. In other words, Holmgren is one of the game's best at creating space on one end and taking it away on the other. In addition to serving as a roaming rim protector, Holmgren can defend in space against all five positions, holding up well against switches in the playoffs. He can also create for himself on the offensive end. There is more to his game, and while Oklahoma City may not need him to demonstrate the full array of his skill set, the idea that the 23-year-old should be an All-Star in his two-way role is a scary thought. Garland is among the league's best point guards and certainly its best secondary guard, as he complements Donovan Mitchell in Cleveland's backcourt. While Mitchell is the more ball-dominant player, his willingness to cede some control of the offense to Garland led to a 64-win campaign for the Cavaliers. When Mitchell, Garland and Evan Mobley — all top-10 options in their roles — shared the floor together last season, the Cavs outscored opponents by 10.1 points per 100 meaningful possessions, per Cleaning the Glass , regardless of who took the court with them. That is the stuff of true championship contention. It did not work out that way in the playoffs again, as a toe injury prevented Garland from taking the floor for Cleveland's first two losses to the Pacers in an eventual five-game exit from the second round. Nor were Mitchell and Mobley healthy for the team's second-round loss to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in 2024. This gives the Cavaliers reason to believe in proof of concept when everyone is healthy — to believe that they can break through if only Garland is present to complement Mitchell and Mobley. Gordon was miscast as a No. 1 option in Orlando, where the Magic were a lottery team with him at the helm. He immediately became one of the league's best complementary stars in 2021 upon joining the Nuggets, for whom the pick-and-roll combo of Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray was a clear-cut 1-2 punch. Denver just needed Gordon to do what he was best at doing. Offensively, he cuts and rolls to the rim, where he is among the NBA's most explosive athletes, or pops to the 3-point line, where he shot 43.6% on 3.4 attempts per game last season. Defensively, he can and does switch across multiple positions. Gordon was the missing piece to Denver's 2023 championship run, manhandling smaller defenders and outmaneuvering bigger ones. He might have been last season, too, if a hamstring injury had not limited him at the end of a seven-game series with the eventual champion Thunder. There are few players in the league who understand and execute their roles as well as Gordon, who unlocked a perennial contender. Sabonis is capable of a triple-double from the center position on any given night, averaging a 19-14-6 last season. Production-wise, there are few third options who can compete with Sabonis, who is among the league's best low-post scorers, arguably its best rebounder (he has led the NBA in that category each of the past three seasons) and one of its best passers — perhaps second only to Jokić among big men. We have to wonder what Sacramento might look like if either of its top two options, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, were the type of two-way performers that could carry a winning franchise. Likewise, how might the Kings fare if the roster were built to complement Sabonis? If, for example, Sacramento featured a floor-spacing rim protector like Holmgren at Sabonis' side, might they be a fringe contender? Indiana and Sacramento have built playoff rosters around Sabonis, who has served as anywhere from a first to third option. He is best suited as a No. 3, though maybe not in Sacramento, where neither LaVine nor DeRozan are defenders. What the Kings need from Sabonis is defense, but that is not his game. He has every other complementary skill, which leads us to wonder if he would be better suited elsewhere. Bane was among the NBA's best third stars in Memphis, where he complemented Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr., averaging a 20-5-4 as one of the league's deftest sharpshooters over the past four years, which included a pair of No. 2 seeds in the Western playoffs. Bane was also fifth on this list a year ago. The Magic identified Bane as their missing piece, paying a hefty price, including the rights to four first-round draft picks, to acquire him from the Grizzlies. Orlando desperately needed shooting around its co-stars, Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner, and Bane is that. The 27-year-old has shot 41% on 6.3 attempts a game in a five-year career, proving to be just as effective as a pull-up shooter as he is a spot-up threat. Orlando has not fielded a top-10 offense since 2010, which is remarkable. If the Magic are to become a contender, as they expect, an elite offense is a necessity. And if Bane can get them there, he may warrant a higher standing on this list a season from now, as his skills are perfectly suited to solve Orlando's issues. The Magic are also perfectly suited to mask Bane's defensive limitations. Fit is everything, and Bane fits. 6. Ivica Zubac , Los Angles Clippers 7. Draymond Green , Golden State Warriors 8.

We are now one week away from the start of the NBA season, which means many of our pre-season pipe dreams and fantasy scenarios will be doused in cold water from the reality of real NBA games. However, some of our pre-season darlings will emerge through the first few weeks and announce their arrival as players to keep an eye on in this new season. Below is a breakdown of some of my favorite breakout candidates for the 2025-26 NBA season. Some of them have already flashed star upside, some of them showed it in college, and others are going to demonstrate it to the NBA fanbase for the first time. But let's dig in and find out why I think these players are get to soar to new heights this year. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , I know it's weird to call a player with an ADP nearly inside the top 50 a breakout, but I just believe there's another level for Murphy. Last season, he averaged career highs in points (21.2), rebounds (5.1), and assists (3.5), but he played just 53 games due to injury, so his performance kind of went under the radar. People were also harping on his turnover rate increasing and his three-point shooting efficiency decreasing, but I think that's the nature of a young player stepping into a bigger role; there are some growing pains along the way. Murphy is a talented player who can do a bit of everything and will start for a Pelicans team that will be without Dejounte Murray (Achilles) for a while. Zion Williamson is not the picture of health himself, so there could be stretches where it's just Murphy and Jordan Poole asked to shoulder the load for the Pelicans. I think Murphy's efficiency will continue to improve, and I'm going to bet on a player with his natural talents to continue to succeed. You could argue that Castle started to breakout at the end of last season, when he averaged 19.4 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 5.6 assists over 26 games without De'Aaron Fox in the lineup. However, I don't think enough people are accounting for continued growth here. Castle was the fourth overall pick in last year's draft and won NBA Rookie of the Year, but he doesn't really come up in many conversations about ascending young talents. Yes, Fox should be back a some point early in the season when his hamstring injury heals, and the Spurs drafted Dylan Harper with the second pick, but Castle doesn't really need the ball in his hands to be successful. He's an excellent slasher and understands the spacing of the floor well enough to cut into open lanes. We've also seen him look more comfortable shooting from behind the arc this preseason, which would be a major box ticked in the evolution of his game. I don't expect him to become an elite shooter by any means, but it's just another tool in a pretty loaded toolbox. 2025-26 Rotoworld Basketball Expert Mock Draft: Wemby goes No. 1 over Jokic Victor Wembanyama goes No. 1 in Rotoworld’s 12-team expert fantasy basketball mock draft. See how the rest of the draft unfolded. Zak Hanshew , Buzelis is everybody’s breakout pick, and his ADP on Yahoo sites alone is now inside the top 80 picks. A lot of that is because of what he has done this preseason, but also because he showed what he can do in a high-usage role last season when he averaged 13.3 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks in 27 minutes per game over his final 33 games. There will be some inconsistencies because he's still a young player who just turned 21 years old this week (CHEERS!). Still, Buzelis will assuredly find himself in a high-usage role for a rebuilding Bulls team that lacks many playmakers apart from Josh Giddey and, sometimes, Coby White. Buzelis can do a little bit of everything, and I think he should be able to improve on those numbers we saw in the final 33 games, but do it for an entire season. Can I call somebody a breakout just because I like their vibe? I enjoy the way Camara plays basketball, and his nickname is “The Shadow,” which is almost enough of a case for him to appear in this article, but there are legitimate on-court reasons as well. Camara is an excellent defender, which will help you with STOCKS, but also will keep him on the court for major minutes. Last season, he also took a big step forward offensively, improving his usage rate and becoming more efficient as a scorer. However, he scored only 11.3 points per game, so I think another step is coming. With Anfernee Simons and Deandre Ayton out of town, there is more opportunity to go around, so I think Camara will see his usage rate increase again this year. He's not likely to be an elite scorer off the dribble, but he continues to improve as a shooter, so if we think of him as a 3-and-D wing with the tools to add a little value as a slasher and finisher in transition, there's a chance he pushes for top-50 value. Yes, Sheppard didn’t do much last year and played only 12.6 minutes per game, and is on a team that just traded for Kevin Durant, so he's clearly not going to emerge as a major offensive force in his second season. Still, Sheppard was the 3rd pick in last year’s draft and was a \"high floor\" prospect who could shoot, play defense, and see the floor well. Even as a rookie, he posted elite deflection rates that backed up his strong block and steal numbers from college. He's a strong shooter and should push for the starting PG job with Fred VanVleet out. Even if he settles in somewhere around 10-14 points per game, he's going to make some threes every game and initiate offense for a Durant-led team that should give him solid assist numbers to go along with STOCK upside. I think he can help across all nine categories. Fantasy Basketball Dynasty Top 300: Wembanyama, SGA, and the arrival of Cooper Flagg Victor Wembanyama is clearly the most valuable player in dynasty leagues. Noah Rubin , Robinson has already “broken out” if you’re a New Yorker who has been waiting for him to start and be healthy forever. When he's on the court, his rebound numbers are insane, and he's an efficient scorer around the rim. However, things could be much better for Robinson this season. With Mike Brown now coaching the team, Robinson looks likely to start in New York with Karl Anthony Towns at power forward. That alone will allow Robinson to post tremendous rebound numbers with solid points/blocks. Yet, another level of breakout could happen because Mike Brown wants the Knicks to play fast and get out and run. Even though Robinson isn't the athlete he was as a rookie before all of his lower-body injuries, he's a great athlete for his size and could thrive in a transition-based offense. This could be a big year for Mitch. The breakout case for Jackson is simple since he will likely start at center with Myles Turner gone on a Pacers team that also needs to replace the scoring and usage of Tyrese Haliburton. Fantasy baseball drafters are aware of this, and Jackson is zooming up boards; however, there is plenty of breakout potential here. He has been great per minute as a reserve, and should have plenty of value for a team that is desperate for people to step up. Even if his offensive game doesn't take a huge step forward, he will have plenty of value in rebounds, blocks, and steals. We also need to note that he is coming off a torn Achilles, so the only question will be how quickly he actually does get back to 100%. Bona was basically a defense-first, high-efficiency big man off the bench for the vast majority of last season. However, he started 11 games at the end of the season with Joel Embiid hurt and posted 14.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, 2.4 blocks, and 1.2 steals in those games. That's the kind of upside you're dreaming on here, and we know his breakout potential is fully tied to Embiid's health. However, Embiid is never healthy and is coming off yet another knee injury. Bona was solid for Turkey in EuroBasket, and I think he's ready for a bigger role this season. He won't be a huge scorer, but is a good athlete, with plenty of block/rebound value. The breakout case for Diabate is a little bit less for him to emerge as a star and more for him to emerge as a solid NBA starter. I think he can take over the starting center role in Charlotte, but he will have to beat out Ryan Kalkbrenner. When he was given the chance to start last year, he showed elite rebounding value and also solid STOCK value as well. He has always been a great rebounder and high-motor player, but he's also evolving as a scorer, and we've seen some nice post moves from him in the pre-season. I think he can get more involved in the offense this season, and his defense will keep him on the floor, which means he could be a legitimate double-double threat every night this season."}

With the NBA returning to NBC and Peacock for opening night on Oct. 21 and Prime Video added as a new partner, the league will have a different look in 2025-26. Here are 10 players to keep an eye on this season: It's the first full season with the Los Angeles Lakers for Doncic, who has officially taken over the franchise. Despite LeBron James still being his teammate, it's clear that Doncic is both the future and the present for the Lakers. After dropping weight and signing a max extension over the offseason, all eyes should be on Doncic. Normally considered the 1B to Jayson Tatum's 1A, the former Finals MVP will have to do it alone this year. Tatum is out with a torn Achilles , giving Brown his first chance to show what he can do as a No. 1 option. The Boston Celtics ' championship roster has been completely slashed, but Brown remains the leading force. The No. 1 pick in the draft will always come with increased fanfare, but Flagg joins the Dallas Mavericks with heightened expectations. After trading away Doncic, Dallas struck gold in the lottery . Flagg is now on a ready-to-win roster, where he won't be relied on as heavily as most top picks. How will he fit alongside Anthony Davis? Similar to Doncic, Butler was traded in the middle of last season. He hit his stride immediately, as the Golden State Warriors went 23-7 with him in the lineup to close the regular season. Seeing Butler play next to Steph Curry, Draymond Green and newly-signed Al Horford for a full season could be special -- if the aging veterans can stay healthy . Hopefully we can watch him play this season, right? The former league MVP suited up for just 19 games last year and 39 the year prior. Injuries have plagued the Philadelphia 76ers ' center, but he seems to be OK entering the 2025-26 campaign. When he does play, Embiid is among the most skilled stars in the NBA. The Atlanta Hawks were the darling of the offseason, adding Kristaps Porzingis , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard -- and hoping Jalen Johnson returns from injury. One player that didn't get a new deal from Young, who can opt out of his contract after this season. This team represents Young's best chance to make a deep playoff run since the 2021 conference finals run, but all the pressure is on considering his uncertain future. We've been playing this game with Williamson since he was drafted first overall in 2019 -- will he or won't he stay healthy and in shape? Weight issues have hindered him throughout his career, and this could be his last chance to make it work in New Orleans. Still just 25 years old, Williamson has to prove he can make it through a full season. His significant other A'ja Wilson just won her third championship and fourth WNBA MVP for the Las Vegas Aces. What can Adebayo do to respond? The Miami Heat center is always one of the league's best defenders, but his scoring has dipped in recent years. With Butler out of town, more of the offensive load should fall on Adebayo in a critical year for his career. Like Brown, Nembhard is facing a season without his running mate. Tyrese Haliburton's torn Achilles will put Nembhard into the lead guard role for the Indiana Pacers. Fresh off another impressive playoff run that led to an NBA Finals loss in Game 7 , Nembhard now needs to carry his usual postseason production across an 82-game season. The Detroit Pistons were the surprise of the NBA last season, going from 14 wins to 44 wins and giving the New York Knicks a scare in the first round. Cunningham led the way, making his first All-Star Game and Third Team All-NBA. What does he have in store for 2025-26? The 6-foot-6 guard just turned 24 last month, so he presumably could continue to level up."}

And, despite the scrutiny it might create, that means deepening relations with Abu Dhabi and its wealthy neighbors.", "body": "ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -- It's a few minutes before tipoff in the first NBA game of any sort in the 2025-26 season and the basketball court inside Etihad Arena is overflowing with training camp-sized rosters of Knicks and 76ers players and officials. On the sideline, Patrick Ewing is shaking hands with a man from Beirut who is wearing a vintage No. 33 Knicks jersey. Derrick Rose, who was flown in for the event, is posing for photos with a group of Filipino fans. Steve Harvey and Patrick Schwarzenegger, among other invited celebrities, are being escorted to courtside seats. Throughout the crowd, many Emirati men are wearing kanduras, traditional ankle-length white robes, but they are vastly outnumbered by ex-pats from dozens of other countries, including a teenager from Riyadh a few rows behind the 76ers bench, wearing an Anthony Edwards Team USA jersey and a pair of the newest version of Edwards' Adidas signature shoes, which technically hadn't even been released yet. But perhaps the most interesting interaction taking place is between two Americans. Next to the team benches are two of the most powerful men in the NBA, Knicks owner James Dolan and commissioner Adam Silver, laughing and chatting, warmly embracing the evening together despite years of frosty relations . Standing between Dolan and Silver is the man who brought them together: His Excellency Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, who has spent the past decade developing relationships and directing growing investment dollars to bring top stakeholders in the sport to Abu Dhabi. That Silver and Dolan are aligned on their partnerships with Al Mubarak is one of the signs that the future of global basketball is being brokered now amid the giant cranes and rising cities in the Middle East. Despite their differences at home, Dolan and Silver are united in knowing this is a vitally important relationship to nurture. International basketball is on the cusp of a new, richer and expansive era that is aiming to deliver more of the sport to underserved fans and -- perhaps more importantly -- capture vast sovereign wealth fund capital that is seeking a place to invest in the sport. Some legacy leagues are in danger of being left behind. Some new leagues are trying to rise up. The NBA is focused on defending and strengthening its position as the biggest dog. And, despite the scrutiny it might create , that means deepening relations with Abu Dhabi and its wealthy neighbors. \"WHEN I CLOSE my eyes, I can see an NBA game being played in front of 22,500 people at the Sphere,\" Al Mubarak says as he leans back in a chair in a glittering building on the expansive NYU Abu Dhabi campus. He's not talking about Las Vegas. \"We will have the world's greatest technology where we can immerse the fans in the experience and they can feel the game on a new level.\" Al Mubarak, or \"the chairman\" as he is often referred to by colleagues in his various cultural and leadership positions in Abu Dhabi, has engineered partnerships with the likes of Pope Francis, renowned architect Frank Gehry and UFC CEO Dana White. But he loves American sports and is an active NBA fan. \"I have some mixed feelings on the [Luka] Doncic trade,\" Al Mubarak says, referencing his favorite team, the Lakers. \"I am a believer in the importance of the traditional big man and Anthony Davis was such a part of the [2020] championship. But I know that Luka is motivated and he is one of the most talented players in the game.\" Over the summer, the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) Abu Dhabi, of which Al Mubarak is the chairman, finalized a massive deal with Dolan's Sphere Entertainment to construct and operate a new venue in the UAE, with rights to build more in the Middle East and North Africa over the next 10 years. The original Sphere, which opened in Las Vegas in 2023, cost Dolan's company $2.3 billion to construct and has since lost more than $1 billion, according to its public financial disclosures. Dolan declined to comment for this story. Dolan turned to Abu Dhabi, where he found willing partners, both in the Sphere and in the Knicks, after a six-year effort to build a second Sphere in London failed in 2024 amid a tangle of red tape and political pushback. Last season Abu Dhabi's tourism arm, Experience Abu Dhabi, became the Knicks jersey-patch sponsor in a multiyear lucrative deal, but that was an appetizer to the Sphere partnership that came later. More NBA-linked deals are in the works in Abu Dhabi. This fall, the NBA is expected to finalize a long-term extension of its relationship with the DCT that will guarantee annual preseason games in Abu Dhabi and establish a new NBA Global Academy at NYU's Abu Dhabi campus, where top prospects from around the world will be sent to live, get an education and develop their games. The deal is expected to last well into the next decade, sources told ESPN. It is also a precursor to another large and potentially pivotal deal. The NBA is in discussions with Al Mubarak and other leaders about investing in NBA Europe, which has emerged as a league priority over the past year. In what could prove to be a signature move of Silver's tenure, the NBA is investigating launching a new NBA-branded European league as early as 2027, with a mix of existing teams recruited away from other leagues and expansion. Abu Dhabi is considering the possible launch of a team in Manchester, where they have owned and turned Manchester City Football Club into a global leader in soccer with world-class infrastructure. \"It is a possibility,\" Al Mubarak said of investing in an expansion team in NBA Europe. \"The NBA is the world's best basketball league and we have a deep commitment and track record of success in the [Manchester] community.\" The NBA is seeding the ground ahead of the potential investment in Manchester. Last summer, the league conducted its first-ever Basketball Without Borders event in the United Kingdom by bringing top teen boys and girls to Manchester. In the 2026-27 season, the league is exploring bringing NBA teams to play at least one game in Manchester, sources told ESPN. Silver and deputy commissioner Mark Tatum traveled to London and Paris over the summer for meetings about placing teams in both cities. They also met with leadership from Real Madrid about recruiting the legacy team to the NBA Europe league. In August, NBA Hall of Famer Tony Parker, who owns ASVEL, a team based near Lyon, France, indicated his interest in jumping to the new league by telling reporters: \"NBA Europe league for me is just a matter of time. They are coming, and it's going to happen.\" In recent weeks, leadership in legacy European teams Alba Berlin in Germany and Galatasaray, a large multisport conglomerate in Istanbul, have confirmed publicly their interest in NBA Europe. But having Abu Dhabi invest, be it in Manchester or elsewhere, is a huge boost for the concept. And with a potential expansion fee in the hundreds of millions to join the league, it could set an important standard for other investors as the new league establishes its footing. \"They are the lead investors in Manchester City. And they've had tremendous success there. They've demonstrated they are innovators in sport. They've demonstrated that they're in it for the long term, that they're not just financial investors, that they're active participants,\" Silver said as he stood with Tatum and George Aivazoglou, the NBA's head of Europe and the Middle East, all of whom came to Abu Dhabi to continue discussions about the future. \"So they are dream investors.\" • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Such foreign investment -- across many industries -- has sometimes drawn criticism. The NBA is far from alone among high-profile American companies with ties to Abu Dhabi, including Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., the Cleveland Clinic and ESPN parent company Disney, which earlier this year announced a partnership with Abu Dhabi for a theme park not far from where the new Sphere will be constructed. The NBA, for its part, has previously faced concern about partnerships with countries and leaders whose values don't necessarily align with those publicly supported by the league itself . In launching its Basketball Africa League in 2021, the NBA came under congressional scrutiny for partnering with Rwandan dictator Paul Kagame . Earlier this year, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo called for the NBA and other international sports leagues and teams to sever ties with Rwanda and questioned whether the NBA's \"commitment to social justice and respect for human rights\" aligns with its business ties to Rwanda. Last year, as the NBA's ties with Abu Dhabi deepened, Human Rights Watch issued a warning , saying, in part: \"The NBA should be aware that the U.A.E. hosts high profile sporting, entertainment, and cultural events to promote a public image of openness and tolerance at odds with the government's rampant systemic human rights violations.\" These include what HRW calls unequal rights for women. The NBA has responded to these claims in the past by saying the league follows \"the lead of the U.S. government as to where it's appropriate to engage in business around the world,\" as deputy commissioner Tatum said in a letter to U.S. senators last year. Through the building of courts and investments in new programs, the NBA has fostered growth in basketball in Rwanda , including for many women. The NBA also has championed the Middle East partnerships' effect on basketball participation in the region, citing studies that show a 400% increase in participation in the UAE and 50% in the Middle East over the past five years among boys and girls. Formula 1, the European Tour and WTA Tour also have long-standing relationships with and hold major events in Abu Dhabi. \"I think that what we share with the leaders [in Abu Dhabi] is this belief in the power of sport, and that as we look around the world, very few things that create commonality, empathy, understanding in the way sport does,\" Silver told ESPN. \"For example, I think many people outside the region might be surprised to see that there are an equal number of girls and boys in the youth programs here. And that there are universal values that are being taught in terms of respect, discipline, hard work, teamwork, understanding -- all fundamental values that we share. And at a time when so much divides us, it's nice to be focused on things that bring us together.\" TWO NIGHTS BEFORE the NBA opened its season in Abu Dhabi, a seminal event took place 75 miles down the E11 highway, in the sprawling metropolis of Dubai. There, two-year-old Dubai Basketball hosted its first-ever EuroLeague game against Serbian basketball power KK Partizan at the modern Coca-Cola Arena. The EuroLeague, the most competitive league in the world outside the NBA, is facing an uncertain future with NBA Europe looming and threatening its markets. In response, the EuroLeague took the extraordinary step of giving the brand-new Dubai team a five-year wild-card berth into the league. The deal, according to reports in Europe, includes covering the traveling expenses of European teams that will fly up to seven hours for the away games. Bringing major Western sporting events to the UAE is a goal of all this investment. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now After 15 years as title sponsor of the EuroLeague, Turkish Airlines was replaced this season by Abu Dhabi-owned Etihad Airlines on a four-year deal that will assist in the travel. Emirates Airline, the Dubai-owed rival of Etihad, signed a long-term deal with the NBA in 2024 to become the title sponsor of the NBA Cup. Still, the league doesn't currently have plans to base an NBA Europe team in the Middle East and playing the NBA Cup final in Dubai isn't under consideration, Silver told ESPN. Recently, the league announced changes to the NBA Cup schedule, including moving the semifinals to home team markets from Las Vegas starting in 2026, with the final at a neutral site. Last spring, the EuroLeague held its final four in Abu Dhabi, another deal put together by Al Mubarak, to sold out crowds, the first time the event had ever been held outside Europe. The future of European basketball, it is increasingly clear, runs through the UAE. LAST APRIL, IN a news release that made some noise in the private equity world, TWG Global announced a $10 billion investment from Mubadala Capital with the proceeds \"to be used by TWG to capitalize on its attractive set of proprietary investment opportunities.\" TWG Global is the holding company for the investments of Los Angeles businessman Mark Walter and his partners. Mubadala Capital is the asset management wing of Abu Dhabi's largest sovereign wealth fund. Two months later, this development contributed to enormous noise in the sports world when Walter, via TWG Global, agreed to buy the controlling share of the Los Angeles Lakers for a $10 billion valuation. The future of the NBA's most prized franchise, it seems, is also linked to the UAE. The Middle East interest in new basketball ventures goes deeper. Two years ago, the Qatar Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of the wealthy Gulf nation, bought 5% of the Washington Wizards' parent company. That same year, Qatar won a bid to host the 2027 FIBA World Cup. The fund is also the controlling owner of European soccer power Paris Saint-Germain, which in March 2025 confirmed it had been in talks regarding NBA Europe. Like Abu Dhabi with its Manchester City property, PSG could launch an expansion team under the same brand and act as an anchor tenant. Over the summer, in a move that could ultimately dovetail with such an eventual basketball investment, PSG made a landmark agreement to expand a partnership with NBA superstar Kevin Durant in which Durant got a small ownership stake in PSG. \"This club has big plans ahead and I can't wait to be a part of the next phase of growth,\" Durant said at the time. \"And to explore new investment opportunities with [Qatar].\" There are other ventures also seeking investment from Middle East sources.

Sign Up Now In February, the Financial Times reported the sovereign wealth funds of both Singapore and Saudi Arabia were among the potential backers behind a new global circuit basketball league. In the months since, the extent of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund's (PIF) proposed involvement in the new basketball league has not been formally made public. Sela, a Saudi events company owned by the PIF, did confirm its involvement with the startup league. Multiple player agents, current and former league executives and support staffers told ESPN they'd been recruited to join the league ahead of a possible 2026 launch and, in some cases, were required to sign NDAs. At times, this recruitment involved superstar LeBron James' longtime business partner Maverick Carter, who worked as an adviser to the league for months. Last week, Carter confirmed to ESPN he had left the venture, which calls itself Project B and its representatives said in media interviews it is now focusing on starting a women's basketball league to rival the WNBA. The PIF and Sela did not respond to requests for comment on their level of involvement. A spokesperson for Swiss banking giant UBS, which announced it was advising the startup league earlier this year, declined to comment on its current relationship with the project but confirmed the fledgling league was still a client. James' representatives, including agent Rich Paul, told ESPN that James himself was not connected to the venture. James has developed a relationship with Saudi Arabian leaders and the PIF over the past few years, though. James held a clinic at Al-Azem Academy in Riyadh in 2023 as a guest of Saudi Minister of Culture Bader bin Farhan Al Saud. Last January, James became a team owner in E1, a global electric boat racing circuit that was launched by the PIF. Tom Brady and Rafael Nadal are also affiliated with teams in E1. At a recent conference hosted by Front Office Sports, Silver said he was not following those developments, but added: \"Competition is good. It keeps everyone on their toes.\" Silver, however, is focused on his Middle East partners in Abu Dhabi. How and where all the money might flow and the impact it could have remains to be seen. But what is known is that the connection between the NBA and the Middle East is real, and an expansion of the relationship is coming, and the league is shoring up support with rivals, both seen and unseen, across the region. \"We are thinking about the long term, not just the next couple of years,\" Al Mubarak said. \"I believe that this partnership with the NBA will outlive me.\" ESPN's Ramona Shelburne contributed to this story."}

Ivey missed the last 49 games last season after a left fibula injury and played one preseason game before issues of discomfort arose. Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said it wasn't a particular play that birthed the injury. \"It was something that was developing over his work. Obviously, from coming back but in training camp also, he started to feel something,\" Bickerstaff said before the Pistons' final preseason game against the Washington Wizards . \"We took precautions, and then the medical team did their assessments and those things, and then had to make the decision that ultimately led us to where we are today.\" Ivey, the fifth pick in the 2022 draft, was in the midst of a breakout season last year before colliding with Magic guard Cole Anthony on New Year's Day. He was averaging 17.6 points and shooting 41% from 3-point range, both career highs. The Pistons acquired veteran guard Dennis Schroder to play backup point guard in the wake of Ivey's injury last season. Bickerstaff believes guards Marcus Sasser and two-way guard Daniss Jenkins can fill in the blanks during this absence. Third-year forward Ausar Thompson has been given more responsibility in training camp to be a primary facilitator when All-NBA guard Cade Cunningham goes to the bench. As for Ivey, it could be 10 months before he sees regular-season action again, and he's up for a rookie-scale extension should the team and he agree on a contract before the Oct. 20 deadline. The Pistons will be careful with his recovery given the back-to-back injuries to one of the league's fastest players. \"Our priority is to do what's right by our guys, and never put them in a position where we feel like we have to rush them back,\" Bickerstaff said. \"We know mentally how that can impact him, physically and long-term as well.\""}

Green represents a tremendous success story for the Bucks as an Iowa native who went from undrafted in 2022 to landing a two-way contract, then a standard deal and now a lucrative long-term pact. Green is now under contract through the 2029-30 season in Milwaukee as the Bucks keep him from entering free agency next summer - a critical commitment given that the 26-year-old has emerged as the full-time starter for Doc Rivers entering the new campaign. Green scored 541 points last season after scoring just 406 points in his first two NBA seasons, for an average of 7.4 per game. He is one of the elite shooters in the league as a career 42% 3-point shooter and has shot at least 40% on 3-pointers in all three seasons of his NBA career. Green has only started eight regular-season games in his career, but during the first round of the playoffs in April, Rivers inserted Green into the starting lineup for a must-win Game 5 and Green responded with 19 points and played 46 minutes. His playoff production increased to 11.0 points while shooting 51% from 3 during a strong postseason, which he has followed up with a spot in the starting lineup for all four of the Bucks' preseason games this month. Green's 42.7% 3-point mark last season was the sixth-best among players to attempt at least 300 3-pointers, according to ESPN Research, and he shot 44.9% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, which was fifth-best among players with at least 250 attempts.

(0:33) SAN FRANCISCO -- The NBA fined Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga $35,000 for the actions that led to his ejection late in the first half of a preseason win in Portland on Tuesday night. Kuminga was upset after he didn't receive a whistle on a shot attempt with seven seconds left in the second quarter. Kuminga stumbled while attempting a barreling transition drive through two defenders, missed the layup and immediately went after nearby official Rodney Mott, clapping in Mott's face. Mott ejected Kuminga. Two days later, the league fined Kuminga for \"making inappropriate contact with and continuing to pursue a game official.\" After the game, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he \"kind of liked [the ejection], actually\" because he has been searching for some extra fire from Kuminga. \"He got fouled,\" Kerr said. \"It was a frustration play. I have no problem with it. He deserved the foul. He was getting fouled quite a bit. It was a physical game.\" After some contentious contract negotiations this summer, Kuminga returned to the Warriors on a two-year, $46.8 million contract earlier this month, arriving at training camp a couple days late. He has flashed some improved playmaking in the preseason and had 7 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists at the moment of his ejection. \"The way he ran on [the ejection] play, the activity he played with, the rebounding,\" Kerr said. \"That's the JK who can really help our team, I loved the way he played. I love the fire, the passion, I don't mind the ejection at all.\" Kuminga's arm appeared to be whacked on the drive, but he told ESPN in the postgame locker room that he was most upset about his right ankle getting clipped on his gather step. Kuminga badly twisted his right ankle last season and said he had a flashback to that injury when Portland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija accidentally stepped on it, causing him to lose his temper on the official. \"I wasn't surprised he got ejected because he kind of got right in [Mott's] face,\" Kerr said. \"You can't do that. They are going to eject you if you do that.\""}

(1:30) How will the NBA season look if my stats-based projections are an accurate measure of team ability? The purpose of simulating the NBA season ahead of time is generally to see how often various things are likely to happen, from the weakest teams winning the draft lottery to the best ones taking home the Larry O'Brien Trophy. It can also be fun to go through individual runs of the simulation to give an idea of what unlikely events could become reality based on random chance. In the spirit of ESPN's NFL tradition of detailing the events of a single simulation , let's go through the NBA season using simulation No. 620 -- chosen because of its interesting outcomes -- from opening night to the end of the NBA Finals. Note, this is not my prediction (or ESPN's) of how this season will unfold. The outcomes are produced at random via simulation, and everything else, including player stats, takes creative license. Along the way, we'll crown an NBA Cup winner, enjoy the action on Christmas Day, determine the final playoff seeds, set the draft lottery and winner, run through the play-in tournament, playoffs and finally, name the 2025-26 NBA champion. Let's get to it. Oklahoma City Thunder over Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors over Los Angeles Lakers After getting their championship rings and raising the first banner in the rafters at Paycom Arena, the Thunder showed why they were favored to repeat with an impressive win during Kevin Durant 's Houston debut. Durant scored 27 points against his former team, the first day of the regular season, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams both topped 20 points and Chet Holmgren had five blocks. Later, the Warriors spoiled Luka Doncic 's first home opener with the Lakers, handing them a 107-99 defeat. Afterward, an ebullient Draymond Green vowed that the Warriors, not Oklahoma City, should be considered the title favorites. Quarterfinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (4) Detroit Pistons (2) Miami Heat over (3) Cleveland Cavaliers (4) Minnesota Timberwolves over (1) Oklahoma City Thunder (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (2) Memphis Grizzlies Semifinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (2) Miami Heat (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (4) Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Cup final (Dec. 16): (1) Boston Celtics over (3) Portland Trail Blazers The NBA Cup, running from Oct. 21 to Dec. 16, resulted in an unexpected final in Las Vegas that pitted the Celtics against former guard Jrue Holiday and the Trail Blazers. Boston, off to a 16-10 start without the injured Jayson Tatum , finished as the No. 1 seed in the East play-in and beat the Pistons at home and the Heat in the semifinals in Las Vegas. The upstart Blazers, also 16-10, took advantage of the Thunder getting upset by the Timberwolves at home during the quarterfinals. Portland also won on the road, in Memphis, and then beat Minnesota in the semifinals. Alas, the Blazers' run ended in a 115-103 loss. Portland shot 10-of-36 on 3s, while Derrick White and Payton Pritchard made four apiece for Boston, which immediately shut down talk of referring to the NBA Cup as \"Banner 19.\" Still, the Celtics were able to match the rival Lakers' inaugural NBA Cup title. Struggling teams were the storyline on Christmas Day. The Cavaliers and Knicks , who entered the season as East favorites, were 11th and seventh, respectively, going into their matchup at Madison Square Garden. The Cavaliers, buried by early-season injuries to the backcourt, got some measure of satisfaction with a win over the Knicks. There was no such relief for the Lakers, who dropped five games below .500 after losing at home to Houston. The vibes were better for the top two teams in the West, the surprising Warriors and Thunder, who both won at home. So did the Denver Nuggets behind a 30-point triple-double from Nikola Jokic . As the NBA gathered from Feb. 13 to 15 at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, the Warriors were the talk of the league. Green and Jimmy Butler III joined Steph Curry on the West roster thanks to Golden State's league-best 42-13 record at the break. In the rearview mirror of the experienced Warriors there was plenty of youth with the Thunder 4.5 games back in the West and the ascendant Magic atop the East with the NBA's second-best record. After their slow starts, the Knicks and Cavaliers had righted the ships, moving up to second and fourth in the conference, respectively. The Clippers were tied for fourth in the West, but their crosstown rivals continued to stumble. Now 12 games below .500, the Lakers were all but eliminated from the play-in race at six games back of the Sacramento Kings for 10th. LeBron James mused about taking March off to watch his son Bryce play in the NCAA tournament for the Arizona Wildcats. With less than two weeks left in the regular season, plenty remained at stake, including the top seed in the West. The Thunder had closed within 2.5 games of the still-hot Warriors. The race to avoid the play-in was hard-fought with three teams at 40 wins apiece, albeit with the Blazers two games back in the loss column of Houston and Minnesota. Two games back in the loss column for the play-in, the Mavericks were still looking to make it with Kyrie Irving 's return to the lineup. In the East, the Celtics -- who had gone just 19-30 since winning the NBA Cup -- were trying to hold off the Philadelphia 76ers and disappointing Detroit Pistons to reach the play-in. The Warriors shut down any talk of a Thunder comeback by finishing the season on a 10-game winning streak to reach 63 wins, their most since 2016-17. In the East, the Magic ran away with the top seed and finished seven games clear of the Knicks. The No. 6 seed in both conferences was decided via a tiebreaker. Cleveland, which fell back off the pace after the All-Star break, ended up in the play-in with the Milwaukee Bucks getting the No. 6 seed. Meanwhile, Houston won a tie out West, sending the Timberwolves to the play-in a year after they narrowly avoided it. Defiant, Anthony Edwards vowed Minnesota would get back to the conference finals anyway. Eastern Conference No. 7 Cleveland Cavaliers over No. 8 Miami Heat (Cleveland clinches playoffs to face No. 2 Knicks) No. 9 Chicago Bulls over No. 10 Boston Celtics (Chicago advances; Boston eliminated) No. 9 Bulls over No. 8 Heat (Chicago clinches playoffs to face No. 1 Orlando; Miami eliminated) Western Conference No. 8 Portland Trail Blazers over No. 7 Minnesota Timberwolves (Portland clinches playoffs to face No. 2 Thunder) No. 10 Sacramento Kings over No. 9 Phoenix Suns (Sacramento advances; Phoenix eliminated) No. 10 Kings over No. 7 Timberwolves (Sacramento clinches playoffs to face No. 1 Warriors; Minnesota eliminated) Consider the Chicago Bulls the big winners of the play-in tournament, a place where they've got plenty of experience. Not only did Chicago win in Miami to claim the No. 8 seed in the East playoffs, but the Bulls also landed a first-round pick when Portland capped its unexpected season by winning at the Target Center to earn the seventh spot in the West. Things went from bad to worse for the Timberwolves in the final game of the play-in tournament as the Sacramento Kings handed them a surprise 103-101 loss on a DeMar DeRozan pull-up jumper in the final five seconds. Sacramento players celebrated by donning \"Kings of the Play-in\" T-shirts, much to the Bulls' dismay. There was less drama in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers salvaged the No. 7 seed with a 31-point win over Miami reminiscent of last year's dominant first-round sweep. 1. Utah Jazz (from Minnesota Timberwolves ) 2. Atlanta Hawks (from New Orleans Pelicans ) 3. Brooklyn Nets 4. Washington Wizards 5. Minnesota Timberwolves (from Utah Jazz ) 6. Charlotte Hornets 7. Detroit Pistons 8. Dallas Mavericks 9. Los Angeles Lakers 10. Oklahoma City Thunder (from Philadelphia 76ers ) 11. San Antonio Spurs 12. Boston Celtics 13. Memphis Grizzlies (from Phoenix Suns ) 14. Miami Heat For the second consecutive year, a team eliminated on the eve of the playoffs won the NBA draft lottery. This time, the Timberwolves didn't get to enjoy it like the Mavericks did in 2025. A swap from the Rudy Gobert trade sent the top pick to the Utah Jazz, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny their interest in drafting AJ Dybantsa from nearby BYU. The news wasn't all bad for Minnesota, which swapped down only to No. 5. Meanwhile, the 34-48 Pelicans didn't benefit from jumping up to No. 2, sending that pick to the Hawks to complete their deal on 2025 draft night. The Nets and Wizards claimed the next two picks, having entered with the best odds because of their combined 25 wins. Later on, the playoff-bound Thunder and Grizzlies acquired lottery picks through trades; the Grizzlies had the opportunity to swap for the Suns' pick in the Desmond Bane trade. Speaking to reporters before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged that the league's competition committee will revisit lottery odds to avoid teams preferring the lottery to advancing through the play-in tournament. Eastern Conference Round 1 (1) Orlando Magic over (8) Chicago Bulls , 4-1 (2) New York Knicks over (7) Cleveland Cavaliers , 4-2 (3) Atlanta Hawks over (6) Milwaukee Bucks , 4-1 (5) Toronto Raptors over (4) Indiana Pacers , 4-3 Western Conference Round 1 (1) Golden State Warriors over (8) Sacramento Kings , 4-1 (2) Oklahoma City Thunder over (7) Portland Trail Blazers , 4-0 (6) Houston Rockets over (3) Denver Nuggets , 4-3 (5) LA Clippers over (4) Memphis Grizzlies , 4-2 The most anticipated first-round series -- an expected matchup between the Knicks and Cavaliers in the conference finals -- ended up fizzling. Banged up from a difficult regular season and play-in appearance, Cleveland was eliminated at home in Game 6. But there was plenty of drama elsewhere. Two road teams with less experience won their Game 7s. The Toronto Raptors held former star Pascal Siakam to 15 points on 4-of-16 shooting for their first series win since 2020, and the Rockets shocked the Nuggets in Denver thanks to 12 fourth-quarter points from Durant. Houston hadn't advanced in the playoffs since 2019. The Clippers were the other lower seed to advance, beating Memphis, which ESPN BET listed as the underdog before the series. After winning Game 1 on the road, the Clippers closed out the Grizzlies at home in six games. Eastern Conference semifinals (1) Orlando Magic over (5) Toronto Raptors , 4-2 (2) New York Knicks over (3) Atlanta Hawks , 4-1 Western Conference semifinals (1) Golden State Warriors over (5) LA Clippers , 4-2 (2) Oklahoma City Thunder over (6) Houston Rockets , 4-3 The top two seeds in both conferences advanced in Round 2. For a second consecutive year, the Thunder needed seven games to reach the conference finals, but the Rockets pushed the defending champs without injured point guard Fred VanVleet . \"We'll be back,\" Durant said in a somber Houston locker room. The Warriors beat the Clippers in a battle of the NBA's two oldest rosters, and the Magic and Knicks reminded everyone that they've been the class of the East all season. Both dropped just three total games en route to a showdown in the conference semifinals. Conference finals (1) Orlando Magic over (2) New York Knicks , 4-1 (1) Golden State Warriors over (2) Oklahoma City Thunder , 4-2 The Magic cruised to their first trip to the NBA Finals since 2009, surprising New York at Madison Square Garden in Game 3 to take a 3-0 series lead before completing the gentleman's sweep. Meanwhile, in a battle of the NBA's last dynasty against a team aspiring to become one, the Warriors lived up to Green's seasonlong hype. The teams split the first two games of the series before Golden State won the pivotal Game 5 and then closed out Oklahoma City on the road to host the NBA Finals. (1) Orlando Magic over (1) Golden State Warriors , 4-3 The Warriors' magical run to their seventh Finals in the past 12 years finally ran out of gas at home in Game 7, similar to Golden State's loss to Cleveland in 2016. With Curry playing through a minor injury by the end of the season, the Warriors' potent offense operated at less than full strength. Orlando took advantage, unexpectedly winning the first championship in franchise history barely a year after upgrading their starting lineup with Bane. Paolo Banchero completed a breakthrough campaign by scoring 32 points in Game 7 and being named Finals MVP. He split votes with Franz Wagner , who averaged 22 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in the series while defending Butler. Interviewed on the podium by Lisa Salters, Banchero credited the victory to \"620,\" which observers interpreted as a remixed version of his native 206 area code."}

(0:58) NBA free agency is underway, and teams are adding stars and making moves to fill their rosters for the 2025-26 season. Among the most impactful signings so far: Myles Turner leaving the defending Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers for the Milwaukee Bucks ; max extensions for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jaren Jackson Jr. ; James Harden 's new two-year deal with the LA Clippers ; and the $52.6 million player option for LeBron James with the Los Angeles Lakers . As more deals get reported, we're grading the moves and examining what each means for next season and beyond. Jump to a deal: Booker's max extension | Ayton to Lakers Turner chooses Bucks | SGA's supermax Grizzlies max Jackson | LeBron's opt-in Finney-Smith to Rockets | Harden's new deal MORE: Trade grades | Offseason news, buzz The Sacramento Kings agreed to a five-year, $140 million extension with forward Keegan Murray . Grade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale) The Kings agreed to a one-year contract with guard Russell Westbrook . Grade: D The deadline to strike extensions with rookies entering their final contract year is Monday, and Murray was one of the biggest dominoes remaining. He agreed to an extension with the Kings that pays an identical annual amount to the four-year, $112 million deal Trey Murphy III signed with the New Orleans Pelicans a year ago. As the cap goes up, $28 million per year is worth a little bit less now than it was when Murphy signed. If we projected the maximum 10% annual growth in the cap, this would be closer in value to the deal Josh Giddey recently signed with the Chicago Bulls as a restricted free agent (four years, $100 million). Alas, the cap forecast for 2026-27 no longer includes a 10% increase, a troubling indicator given the league is still smoothing in the revenue from new national TV deals that kick in this season. But placing Murray's value somewhere between Giddey and Murphy is probably about right. After striking his extension, Murphy enjoyed a breakthrough campaign, averaging 21.2 PPG for the Pelicans. Playing on a deeper and healthier Sacramento squad, Murray isn't likely to get that kind of opportunity as a scorer anytime soon. His usage rate declined to a career-low 15% last season, which says more about the Kings loading up on volume scorers than Murray's own lack of growth. Ideally, Murray would get back closer to the 41% he shot from 3-point range as a rookie, when he started 78 games for the Sacramento team that broke the franchise's 16-season playoff drought. Since then, Murray has dipped to 36% and a career-low 34% in 2024-25, but his 37% career mark from 3 is probably the better indicator of what to expect going forward. If given the choice, I'd prefer Murphy because of his more prolific 3-point shooting. He shot up to No. 58 in his NBA Rank debut this season , while Murray is at 94. Intriguingly, my player projections for the upcoming season have Murray as the more valuable of the two players. Despite being sidelined by surgery to repair a UCL tear in his left thumb, Murray has also been far more durable, missing just 13 total games through three NBA seasons. As compared to Giddey, who was unranked, Murray has a lower ceiling but a much higher floor. His ability to defend multiple positions and stretch the floor means Murray fits anywhere in the league. Because Murray will be 26 by the time this extension kicks in, the Kings might not benefit from as much growth over the course of it. Still, if he's only the player we've seen thus far in Sacramento, this is probably a fair contract. Extending Murray will create some financial challenges for Sacramento in 2026-27, when the team's payroll is nearing the luxury tax line with nine players under contract -- not including promising guard Keon Ellis , the Kings' other 2022 rookie. Sacramento has an out via DeMar DeRozan 's partially guaranteed contract, but paying the tax is surely a nonstarter for a Kings team that projects no better than .500. The other piece of Sacramento business on Wednesday affected Ellis' outlook. After communicating with Westbrook all summer, the Kings finally agreed to a one-year deal at the veteran's minimum a week before the start of the season. Murray's injury was surely a factor in the timing, creating more need for Sacramento on the perimeter. Nonetheless, the Kings' backcourt will be overstuffed if Westbrook plays anything close to last season's 28 MPG. Sacramento brought back guards Ellis, Zach LaVine and Malik Monk and previously added Dennis Schroder . If Schroder and Westbrook end up splitting minutes at the point, that leaves three rotation-caliber shooting guards fighting for minutes. Bringing in Schroder to give coach Doug Christie a true point guard after the De'Aaron Fox trade made sense. Westbrook feels like one guard too many, and he's likely to displace minutes from Ellis and Monk, both of whom figure to be more effective. Certainly, Westbrook outperformed my cynical expectations during the regular season he spent with the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook developed strong chemistry with Nikola Jokic and averaged 15.3 PPG, 7.0 APG and 6.1 RPG in 36 starts while posting an above-average .579 true shooting percentage. During the playoffs, however, things fell apart after a strong start. Westbrook shot 11-of-42 (26%) over the last five games of Denver's conference semifinals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder . The Nuggets were outscored by 66 points with him on the court in that span. When Westbrook played without Jokic alongside him last season, he shot an effective 44% from the field, accounting for 3s as 1.5 field goals to reflect their added value. With Jokic on the court, that jumped to 54%. Given Westbrook isn't bringing Jokic with him, the Kings must hope that doesn't carry over. The Miami Heat agreed to a four-year, $62.4 million extension with forward Nikola Jovic . Grade: B+ It's interesting to see a non-max rookie extension against the backdrop of this summer's restricted free agency finally wrapping up with Grimes taking the 76ers' qualifying offer. That sort of extended stalemate is precisely what the Heat and Jovic are avoiding by striking an extension well before the Oct. 20 deadline for the first-round pick who debuted in 2022. At first blush, $60-plus million might seem like a lot for Jovic, who started just 10 of the 46 games he played last season. A couple of factors work in favor of this deal, as is commonly the case with rookie extensions. The first is the rising cap. This contract pays Jovic more than the current non-taxpayer midlevel exception, but it's less than another team could offer using that exception next summer based on current projections. Additionally, this deal pays Jovic through his developmental years, taking him up to age 27. Jovic turned 22 after last season, when he posted career highs in both points per 36 minutes (15.4) and true shooting percentage (.595). Jovic also made strides as a playmaker, averaging a career-high 4.1 assists per 36 minutes. If continued progress makes Jovic a full-time starter like he was in 2023-24 (38 of 46 games), or even a top-tier backup at both forward spots, this deal should pay off for Miami. Guard Quentin Grimes chose to accept his one-year, $8.7 million qualifying offer with the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday. Grade: C Wednesday was the final day for restricted free agents to unilaterally accept the one-year qualifying offers their teams are required to tender in order to secure matching rights, making it the unofficial deadline for most standoffs. Grimes, the last of the four marquee restricted free agents who remained on the market long after most interested teams had used their cap space and exceptions, chose that strategy with an eye toward unrestricted free agency next summer. Realistically, based on the offers Grimes' agent David Bauman reported to ESPN's Shams Charania, there was never any other option. The Sixers' cap situation made it difficult for them to take advantage of Grimes having no market from other teams this summer. Even at the qualifying offer, Grimes pushes Philadelphia into the luxury tax, which will be difficult to justify unless the 76ers look healthier and more effective than they were last season. At this point, Philly is one salary-clearing trade or two away from avoiding the tax altogether, which may be the team's goal by the deadline. Moving Kelly Oubre Jr . without taking back a contract in return would accomplish that, as would trading Andre Drummond and one of the team's minimum-salary players. In the long run, however, paying more now on a multiyear deal for Grimes could have ensured the Sixers benefit beyond this season from one of their few 2024-25 bright spots. Acquired from the Dallas Mavericks for forward Caleb Martin before the deadline, Grimes averaged 21.9 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 4.5 APG in 28 games with Philadelphia. His shooting percentages (56% on 2s, 37% from 3) remained solid in the larger role. Although the lesser quality of competition in March and April should take some of the air out of those numbers, Grimes averaged a career-high 16.1 points per 36 minutes with the Mavericks prior to the trade and is a career 38% 3-point shooter on 7.6 attempts per 36 minutes. I'm a believer that Grimes, who is 25, will be a long-term starter on the wing -- whether it's with the 76ers or somewhere else. Nothing about Grimes taking the qualifying offer prevents Philadelphia from re-signing him next summer, but the Sixers will likely face the same tax issues in nine months and will have to compete with teams that have cap space or their non-taxpayer midlevel exception to offer Grimes. Even if Philly brings Grimes back, it will presumably require his full value. Grimes taking the qualifying offer completes an uncreative offseason for the Sixers, who return 11 of their 14 players under full NBA contract from last season. Certainly, Philadelphia's financial situation made maneuvering difficult, and I liked what the 76ers did around the edges. Dominick Barlow and Jabari Walker are two of the league's more capable players on two-way contracts. Still, it feels like in past summers, Philadelphia president of basketball operations Daryl Morey would have found additional creative workarounds for the team's limitations. The Sixers' approach heading into this season feels more modest after the initial failure of a 2024 spending spree that was anything but. The Golden State Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga came to a contract agreement on Tuesday, giving the restricted free agent a two-year, $48.5 million deal. Grade: B+ A day before the deadline for Kuminga to unilaterally accept his one-year, $8 million qualifying offer as a restricted free agent, he opted to sign one of the longer deals the Warriors made, an agreement that keeps Kuminga with Golden State on a tradable salary. Ultimately, the money was too much for Kuminga to pass up. On this contract, he'll make about $15 million more this season than he would have by accepting the qualifying offer. The tradeoff is Kuminga accepting a 2026-27 team option that will limit his earnings potential if he enjoys a breakout year. Although Kuminga's desire to avoid locking himself in long term is understandable -- which is why he chose this deal over a three-year structure with a team option that would have paid him a similar amount on an annual basis -- the downside probably won't be that substantial. As long as Kuminga is in Golden State, it will be challenging for him to play enough to merit a deal in the $30 million annual range. Kuminga's difficult fit alongside Warriors centerpieces Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green loomed over these negotiations. Despite being Golden State's third-leading scorer, Kuminga fell out of coach Steve Kerr's rotation as the team prepared for the playoffs. He got multiple DNP-CDs, including the Warriors' play-in victory and Game 1 of their first-round win over the Houston Rockets . At the same time, Golden State needs Kuminga -- or a better-shooting replacement -- to manage minutes over the course of the regular season. Kuminga's scoring proved crucial when the Warriors lost Stephen Curry during the second round against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Kuminga averaged 24.3 points per game on 55% shooting over the last four games of that series. The importance of both Kuminga and his salary spot gave him a certain leverage above and beyond the threat of accepting the qualifying offer. Kuminga could have opted not to sign until after the season began, hoping for an injury that could have forced Golden State back to the negotiating table. That would have been an enormous risk, however, and Kuminga's opting for more safety is understandable. From the Warriors' perspective, Kuminga opting to forgo the trade restriction that would ordinarily be part of this contract was critical. Golden State could have worked around that by exercising the 2026-27 option ahead of time, making this a multiyear deal that is not subject to the same restrictions as a one-year deal signed by a player using Bird rights. But Kuminga waiving that trade restriction means the Warriors could include him as an expiring contract in a trade if necessary. The more likely scenario is Golden State finds a workable Kuminga trade that makes both sides happy. Certainly, the interest shown by the Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings reflected Kuminga's value around the league. Striking a sign-and-trade deal this summer was complicated because Kuminga's full salary would not count for trade purposes due to base-year compensation rules. By Jan. 15, when Kuminga is eligible to be traded, that will no longer be an issue. The optimistic case for Kuminga is that he turns 23 next Monday and has shown an impressive ability to get to the foul line. He attempted seven-plus free throws per 36 minutes last season. In conjunction with the kind of shooting from the field we saw from Kuminga during his first three years in the league, he could have solid efficiency given his high usage rate. If that comes to pass, Kuminga will be an unrestricted free agent before his 25th birthday with a chance to build on the $48.5 million he can make on this contract. This might not be the ideal contract Kuminga wanted, but in the long run, it should work out for everybody. Officially signing Kuminga clears the way for the Warriors to complete reported deals for Seth Curry, Al Horford and De'Anthony Melton. All three players were expected to sign with Golden State this summer, but it's worth watching the final figures on the contracts. If Kuminga got the full $48.5 million and Horford the full taxpayer midlevel exception, the Warriors wouldn't have quite enough room under their second-apron hard cap to keep all 15 players under full NBA contract. Getting Melton back at the veteran's minimum is a great outcome for Golden State, which used its non-taxpayer midlevel exception to sign Melton to a one-year deal as an unrestricted free agent last year. Melton was off to a strong start, averaging 10.3 PPG in 20.2 MPG, before suffering a partial ACL tear six games into the season that required season-ending surgery. The Warriors used Melton's salary to acquire Dennis Schroder but now bring him back on a cheaper deal to rebuild his value coming off the injury. Free agent center and former Boston Celtics big man Al Horford committed to signing a multiyear contract with the Golden State Warriors on Sunday. Grade: A- Finally. Horford signing with the Warriors was rumored from the start of free agency nearly three months ago and became obvious once the other possible suitors quickly utilized their exceptions to fill frontcourt needs. Golden State delayed formally agreeing on a contract all summer to maintain flexibility pending the outcome of Jonathan Kuminga 's seemingly endless restricted free agency. Depending on where Kuminga's contract came in, the Warriors could have structured Horford's contract -- which will hard cap them at the second apron by using their taxpayer midlevel exception -- slightly differently. Let's come back to the financial implications of Horford's deal and start by discussing the basketball fit. Even before the Warriors added Jimmy Butler at the February trade deadline, frontcourt shooting was Golden State's biggest need. With Draymond Green an iffy shooter at this stage of his career (32.5% on 3s during the regular season, 27% in the playoffs) and Butler (1.9 attempts per game from long distance) a reluctant one, the Warriors badly need everyone else on the court with them to stretch the floor. (That has been part of the issue with Kuminga, who shot a career-worst 30.5% on 3s last season.) That limitation resulted in Golden State coach Steve Kerr settling on a tiny lineup to close the regular season with no player taller than the 6-foot-7 Butler. Green plays much bigger than his listed height (6-foot-6), certainly, but the best Warriors \"small-ball\" units featured more size alongside him in the frontcourt than we saw last season. Enter the 6-foot-9 Horford, who remains an archetype of versatility in his late 30s. (Horford turned 39 in June and will be 40 by the conclusion of the 2026 NBA Finals.) Horford shot just 36% on 3s last season, but that came on the heels of hitting better than 40% beyond the arc in each of the previous two campaigns. And Horford remains capable of defending on the perimeter better than most centers two decades younger. To keep him healthy for long playoff runs, the Celtics carefully managed Horford's minutes. He last played both ends of a back-to-back set in March 2022 and was limited to 28 minutes per game despite Boston playing much of last season without starting center Kristaps Porzingis . Golden State will want to operate in a similar fashion, making it important for young reserves Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post to help alleviate the 82-game load. Come the postseason, the Warriors have unparalleled playoff experience. After 2021, last year's NBA Finals were the second since 2014 that didn't feature Golden State (which still boasts Green and Stephen Curry from their dynasty run), Butler or Horford. All four rank among the top 10 active players in playoff minutes. How much Kuminga makes this season is limited by apron restrictions. If they fill out the roster with expected minimum signings of Seth Curry, De'Anthony Melton and Gary Payton II , that leaves the Warriors some $24 million to spend on Kuminga while staying clear of the second apron. Signing other free agents to deals with player options such as Horford's would reduce that maximum starting offer slightly because they would count at their full salary rather than the veteran's minimum. But Golden State has more than enough money to make a fair offer to Kuminga on a multiyear deal that would also be highly tradeable. The Chicago Bulls re-signed guard Josh Giddey to a reported four-year, $100 million contract , ending the months-long stalemate between both sides. Grade: B- Giddey is the second of the four key restricted free agents whose negotiations lingered well into the offseason to re-sign with his team, and the first to strike a long-term deal after Cam Thomas accepted the Brooklyn Nets ' qualifying offer. Compared with Thomas, Giddey had far more leverage on his side. Chicago gave up key contributor Alex Caruso to get Giddey from the Oklahoma City Thunder last summer, and Giddey's loftier qualifying offer ($11-plus million) made playing out this season a more viable threat if the Bulls deal wasn't for more than $20 million per year. In that scenario, Giddey would have needed only to sign a three-year contract for $23 million per year as an unrestricted free agent next summer in order to be equally well off. Given that concern, Chicago was probably right to increase Giddey's offer to the point where he was willing to pass on the qualifying offer. After all, Giddey did make strides in his first season with the Bulls, shooting a career-high 38% on 3s to address what had been his biggest offensive shortcoming. Given the keys to Chicago's offense, Giddey nearly averaged a triple-double with 21.2 PPG, 10.7 RPG and 9.3 APG after the All-Star break. His shooting during that span (46% on 3s) is surely unsustainable, but Giddey is too often treated as a finished product at age 22. This contract takes Giddey into his prime years, giving it a chance to age well for the Bulls. Based on the way players at his position develop in their 20s, we've seen that happen with a number of rookie extensions for point guards that were initially panned. Although this deal isn't technically an extension, it's in line with the $112 million over four years Trey Murphy III got from the New Orleans Pelicans last October ahead of restricted free agency. And both Jalen Johnson and Jalen Suggs (five years, $150-ish million) got $5 million per year more, reflecting their more complete two-way contributions. The difference will be important to Chicago next summer, when the Bulls could clear max cap space to build around a core of Giddey, free agent Coby White (who will have a modest $24.5 million cap hold) and 2024 lottery pick Matas Buzelis . It's certainly not clear at this point that any of those players, or rookie Noa Essengue , can be the best player on a contending team. But compared to where Chicago was a couple of years ago -- fighting for a play-in spot with a core of players in their 30s -- at least it represents a direction. The Dallas Mavericks agreed to a reported four-year, $90 million extension with forward P.J. Washington . Grade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale) Extending Washington completes a Dallas offseason in which its decisions make much more sense individually than as a collective plan. As with center Daniel Gafford , who was acquired at the 2024 trade deadline with Washington and struck an extension of his own earlier this offseason, this deal should be good value. Given that Washington will be 28 next summer, when he would have become an unrestricted free agent, it's possible he could have easily commanded $25 million a year. Since joining the Mavericks, Washington has established himself as one of the NBA's most versatile forwards. He can defend in the post or on the wing, shot a career-high 38% on 3s last season and presents a threat putting the ball on the ground when opponents close out too hard to him on the perimeter. The only issue is some of that versatility is wasted in Dallas' overstuffed frontcourt. With Anthony Davis at power forward, Washington won't toggle between the two forward spots as frequently as before the Luka Doncic trade. Instead, the Mavericks will need him to potentially start at small forward and serve as their primary perimeter stopper. I don't think Washington would have been the right choice, but Dallas would have been better off trading one of its five starting-caliber frontcourt options, only four of whom at most can start together. (Even that scenario means using No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg as a nominal shooting guard and pushing Klay Thompson 's floor spacing to the second unit, itself overstuffed with shooting guards.) Although Gafford's extension was structured so he could still be traded this offseason, Washington's deal assures he'll be with the Mavericks for the entire 2025-26 campaign. Because Washington is adding four years and getting the largest possible value, including 8% annual raises, he won't be trade-eligible for six months -- a period that extends beyond the 2026 trade deadline. Trades will be Dallas' only realistic option for shaking up the roster in the near future. Extending Washington means all 12 Mavericks making at least $5 million this season are under contract through 2026-27, with only one option in that group (a player option for newcomer D'Angelo Russell ). That gives Dallas a minimum of $210 million in committed salary for that season, already enough to push the Mavericks north of the projected first apron. We've seen Dallas have to maneuver to avoid a hard cap at the second apron this season, waiving forward Olivier-Maxence Prosper last week and stretching his salary in order to finalize a minimum contract to re-sign guard Dante Exum . The Mavericks' hefty payroll might require similar moves at the margins next summer, too. The Milwaukee Bucks agreed to a reported one-year deal with forward Amir Coffey . Grade: B+ For all the understandable hand-wringing over the Bucks' lack of depth at guard after they waived injured Damian Lillard to stretch his remaining salary, that wasn't the position that held Milwaukee back after Lillard went down in the first round of last season's playoffs. Instead, the Bucks had the hardest time getting production from their small forwards in a five-game loss to the Indiana Pacers . Midseason pickup Kyle Kuzma and Taurean Prince , who started together on the wing to begin the series, averaged a combined 10.8 points on 14-of-45 shooting before giving way to the smaller wing duo of AJ Green and Gary Trent Jr . -- both shooting guards, by trade. Yet Milwaukee had done nothing to address small forward this offseason until now, bringing back Prince on a two-year deal with a player option for 2026-27. Frankly, I'd rather have Coffey, who averaged a career-high 24.3 minutes last season for the LA Clippers while shooting 41% on 3s. There are reasons Coffey languished in free agency until mid-August. He's strictly a role player, with a career 15% usage rate, and one of the league's worst rebounders at forward. But both of those shortcomings also apply to Prince (12.5% usage rate last season), and Coffey is more than three years younger. Ultimately, Coffey probably isn't the answer for the Bucks at small forward either. If they're in the playoff mix, expect Milwaukee to address the position via trade. Still, Coffey is an inexpensive option for the Bucks to improve their depth. The loser here might be former UConn champion Andre Jackson Jr . Milwaukee had 14 players under guaranteed contract, plus Jackson, whose salary is $800,000 guaranteed through opening night. Now, the Bucks probably will have to eat a guaranteed deal to keep Jackson, who started 43 games last season before logging only five minutes in the playoffs. The Boston Celtics agreed to a reported one-year, minimum deal with forward Chris Boucher Grade: A The Celtics made a pair of related deals Tuesday, trading Georges Niang to the Utah Jazz with two second-round picks in exchange for rookie RJ Luis Jr ., who's on a two-way contract. Essentially, Boucher replaces Niang on the roster, a move that saves about $6 million in salary and more than an additional $30 million in luxury taxes. As a backup forward, Boucher could be an upgrade on Niang. I had him ranked No. 22 among free agents this summer . Just two other unrestricted free agents from the top 25 remain unsigned: Malik Beasley , who is the subject of a federal investigation into gambling charges, and Al Horford . With Horford expected to join the Golden State Warriors after they figure out a new contract for restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga , Boucher was the best player realistically available. He shot 36% on 3s and 63% on 2s last season, producing elite efficiency and also proving capable of defending on the wing in big second-unit lineups. In Boston, I'd expect Boucher to serve as a power forward, helping space the floor for the Celtics' non-shooting centers ( Neemias Queta and Xavier Tillman ) and providing supplemental rim protection alongside Luka Garza . It's a bummer that Massachusetts native Niang won't get a homecoming, but the financial incentive to move on was too significant for Boston. Pairing this with the three-team trade that netted Niang, the Celtics have now completely shed Kristaps Porzingis ' $30.7 million at the cost of the second-round picks. It's possible Boston could avoid the luxury tax entirely this season. Cutting the remaining $11.7 million in payroll would require dealing a second player alongside backup forward Sam Hauser ($10 million salary) or dealing Anfernee Simons ($27.7 million) for someone making less money. The San Antonio Spurs agreed to a reported four-year, $229 million max extension with guard De'Aaron Fox Grade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale) Much has changed since the Spurs acquired Fox in what might have been the biggest trade of this year's deadline had Luka Doncic not overshadowed everything else. After losing Victor Wembanyama to deep vein thrombosis following just five games with Fox, San Antonio ended up in the lottery and moved up to No. 2, drafting Rutgers point guard Dylan Harper . Harper's arrival clouds Fox's future with the Spurs. Neither of the two lefties is maximized playing off the ball because of their iffy outside shooting. Fox has shot 35% on catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts over the past five seasons, putting him in the 27th percentile among players with at least 250 attempts in that span according to GeniusIQ. Harper, meanwhile, shot 33% from 3-point range in his lone college season and 1-of-8 in two NBA summer league appearances. If Harper develops as San Antonio reasonably expects, the Spurs will have a decision to make at point guard within two to three years, making the trade value of Fox's contract an atypically important part of the calculus here. Extending Fox is probably preferable to trying to trade him now on an expiring contract. San Antonio was willing to give up multiple first-round picks for Fox in large part because he signaled a willingness to extend with the Spurs by making them his favored landing spot. The Sacramento Kings , under no obligation to send Fox where he wanted to go, presumably got weaker offers from teams that viewed him as primarily a short-term option. Wait too long, however, and San Antonio could see Fox's value decline because of this contract. A 30% max is already rich for Fox, who has only been an All-Star once, when he also made the All-NBA third team in 2022-23 after leading the Kings to the playoffs for the first time in 17 years. Worse yet, Fox's skill set isn't one that has aged well historically. Quickness has been key to Fox's emergence as one of the NBA's better point guards at 6-foot-3 without elite shooting. Players who scored as most similar based on my SCHOENE projection system from previous generations, led by Monta Ellis and Steve Francis, fell out of the league quickly in their 30s. Expecting that kind of outcome for Fox is unrealistic given the way that NBA offense has evolved to create more space for guards to operate and the potential he could become a league-average 3-point shooter. Fox did shoot 37% on 3s in 2023-24 at high volume (7.8 attempts per game) before declining to 31% last season -- worse than his career average. Still, by the end of this contract -- which takes him through age 32 -- Fox is more likely to be an average starting point guard than an elite one. In the NBA's apron era, we've seen similar contract mismatches make players difficult if not impossible to trade. Unlike other teams who hand out extensions in part due to the impossibility of replacing the talent, the Spurs did have a plausible alternative path thanks to $50-plus million in potential 2026 cap space. At the same time, it's arguable that Fox would have been the best prime free agent available, and San Antonio wouldn't have the option of rolling over the cap space to 2027 because Wembanyama will be on a max extension by then. As a result, this was probably an extension worth doing for the Spurs, even if Fox is more likely their point guard for right now rather than the long term. The other thing that has changed for San Antonio since February is that future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul , who started alongside Fox, has decamped for a return to the LA Clippers . Fox will go into training camp with the ball in his hands and time to develop chemistry with Wembanyama that the Spurs hope gets them back to the playoffs this season. And if that happens, having both Fox and Harper can be a positive dilemma for San Antonio. Luka Doncic and the Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a three-year, $165 extension on Saturday Grade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale) Part of the reason the Lakers were perfectly positioned to take Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks six months ago was that they could be relatively certain he wouldn't depart as an unrestricted free agent in summer 2026. Lakers exceptionalism remains alive and well. The Lakers reportedly used Doncic's potential to leave to help keep their remaining first-round picks out of the trade package. Still, it quickly became evident that even if he preferred to stay in Dallas, Doncic was willing to sign up beyond the remaining full season on his contract. Because of restrictions on extensions signed just before or after a trade, Doncic had to wait until Friday to make it official, but his willingness to help the Lakers recruit free agents this offseason had already signaled the inevitability of this outcome. The lone drama here was how Doncic might structure his new contract. Signing a three-year extension with a player option for 2028-29 ideally positions Doncic to make up for the money he lost when the Mavericks traded him. Had he remained in Dallas and signed a supermax extension, Doncic could have bumped his salary up to 35% of the cap (a projected $57.9 million) in 2026-27, having already qualified with back-to-back All-NBA appearances in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Because the supermax is not available to players who change teams after their rookie contracts conclude, Doncic is now limited to 30% of the cap or a 5% raise for 2026-27, whichever is greater. If the salary cap comes in as projected for 2026-27, Doncic will only slightly improve on his existing $49 million player option. The big payday could come in 2028-29, when Doncic will have achieved 10 seasons of experience and can get to the 35% starting salary either as an unrestricted free agent or by signing another extension in August 2027. By then, the Lakers' roster should look very different. Doncic is the only player under contract for more than $15 million beyond this season. Carrying that cap flexibility to summer 2027 would require significant sacrifices beyond just LeBron James . The Lakers could probably re-sign Austin Reaves , who can become an unrestricted free agent next offseason, but they will have difficult choices to face with Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton should Ayton decline an $8.1 million player option. There are still challenges ahead for the Lakers as they continue digging out from under the mistakes made in the wake of the 2020 championship, but the most important piece is in place for the Lakers. In Doncic, the Lakers have their superstar for the future. Mikal Bridges has agreed to a four-year, $150 million contract extension with the New York Knicks Grade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale) There's a lot of context to consider with a Bridges extension, but let's start with this question: Would Bridges have gotten an offer like this as an unrestricted free agent next summer? The answer seems right between yes and no. A year ago, the question might have been whether Bridges' maximum allowed extension ($156 million over the same four years) would be enough to get him to sign. Bridges certainly didn't have a bad first season with the Knicks. After a slow start, he got to league average on 3s and shot 59% inside the arc, way up from two seasons as a primary offensive option with the Brooklyn Nets . Still, Bridges wasn't quite the difference-making player New York hoped when giving up five first-round picks and a swap to get him from the Nets, particularly at the defensive end of the court. Bridges helped the Knicks break through and reach the conference finals for the first time in a quarter-century by upsetting the Boston Celtics , but was outshined by the Indiana Pacers ' 3-and-D role players in that series. Depending on how many other veteran extensions we see, and how many other teams have cap space, it's possible Bridges could have been a target next summer. He'd certainly fit the Detroit Pistons in the spot currently occupied by the older Tobias Harris , for example, and the Pistons could realistically create sufficient cap space to make a similar offer. At the same time, this contract will kick in when Bridges is 30 and looks more like the third- or fourth-best player on a good team than a top-two option. Once upon a time, that distinction made less of a difference in terms of contracts. For a Knicks team that is likely headed toward the second apron, it could be crucial. With Bridges' extension, New York now has about $206 million committed to nine players for 2026-27, including a player option for newcomer Guerschon Yabusele . Retaining center Mitchell Robinson , currently set to be an unrestricted free agent, and filling out the roster would almost undoubtedly take the Knicks into the second apron -- projected at $222 million. For a large-market team like New York, paying the kind of high tax bill associated with a second-apron salary is tolerable for two years. By 2028-29, when Josh Hart and Karl-Anthony Towns are off their current contracts, staying in the second apron would become prohibitively costly -- potentially moving the Knicks' first-round pick to the end of the round. Given New York's financial situation, Bridges would have been nearly impossible to replace with a similar talent had he left as an unrestricted free agent. Acquiring and keeping his Villanova teammate was also surely part of the equation in Jalen Brunson taking a below-market extension last summer that is the only reason the Knicks haven't already reached the second apron. Taking Brunson's deal in particular into consideration, this was probably a deal worth making for New York. But the Knicks are taking on risk by entering into it a year ahead of time. LA Clippers agreed to a contract with guard Chris Paul Grade: A This reunion, bringing Paul back to where he starred for six seasons from 2011 to 2017, figures to work for both sides so long as he enters it knowing what to expect. As a free agent last summer, Paul prioritized playing time. He signed with the San Antonio Spurs and ended up starting all 82 games, becoming the first player to complete a full schedule in his 20th NBA season or later. Joining the Clippers in the likely role of backing up former Houston Rockets teammate James Harden , Paul doesn't figure to start this time around. The partnership between Harden and Paul, which got the Rockets within a game of the NBA Finals in their first season, ended unhappily a year later. But now, both players are at different stages of their careers -- perhaps the last chapter for each of them. Adding Paul is the latest example of the Clippers managing their age and the injury history of star Kawhi Leonard by simply loading up on enough proven contributors that coach Ty Lue should be able to find a workable rotation throughout the regular season. When healthy, the Clippers go 11 deep with players who averaged at least 17 MPG last season. All four Clippers newcomers -- Paul (28.0), Bradley Beal (32.1), John Collins (30.5) and Brook Lopez (31.8) easily surpassed that mark, while they lost just two players ( Norman Powell at 32.6 and unsigned free agent Amir Coffey at 24.3) who played so much. That could lead to some unhappy players in the playoffs if the Clippers get there healthy, but absences throughout the regular season should mean enough minutes to go around. And going at least two deep at every position -- five deep in the backcourt, where Paul, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kris Dunn all figure to come off the bench behind Beal and Harden -- should keep Lue from having to play Harden and Leonard as much as he did in a seven-game loss to the Denver Nuggets in this past season's first round. I'm not sure that brings the Clippers any closer to winning a Western Conference where the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder bring back their entire rotation, the Nuggets have upgraded their depth, and the Houston Rockets have added Kevin Durant . Still, the Clippers look like they've improved, too. And they've done so while keeping an eye on the future with short-term contracts that will allow the Clippers to pivot toward cap space as soon as next summer. Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a reported two-year, $11 million contract with guard Marcus Smart Grade: B After splitting their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between center Deandre Ayton and forward Jake LaRavia , the Lakers still had their biannual exception available to offer Smart more than the veteran's minimum as part of a buyout deal that will get him out of the final season of his contract with the Washington Wizards . Essentially, Smart will replace Jordan Goodwin and Shake Milton , two Lakers guards on non-guaranteed contracts who they will have to waive to make room for Smart under a hard cap at the lower luxury tax apron. (Milton's $3 million salary was set to guarantee Sunday, per ESPN's Bobby Marks.) Although Goodwin and Milton played rotation roles at times in the second half of last season, neither could stay on the court as JJ Redick relied more heavily on his starters in the opening round of the playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Goodwin played 31 minutes in the series and Milton just four. Given Smart's history, including 108 career playoff games with the Boston Celtics and 2022 Defensive Player of the Year honors, he has a better chance of earning Redick's trust and improving the team's shaky perimeter depth. The big question is what Smart the Lakers are getting. He struggled during the first half of last season with the Memphis Grizzlies , shooting just 36% before the Grizzlies moved him to Washington at the deadline for expiring contracts. Smart played just 39 games during two seasons in Memphis after dealing with multiple injuries and failing to make the same impact at either end as he did with the Celtics. Smart's physical style of play has allowed him to defend far bigger opponents despite being 6-foot-3. During 15 appearances with the Wizards, Smart did look revitalized before being shut down late in the season. He's 31, and although Smart has never been a good 3-point shooter (32% career), his volume of attempts (5.9 per 36 minutes) means defenses have to pay somewhat more attention to him than they did Goodwin. After shooting 38% on a small sample of 3s during the regular season, Goodwin did not make any in the playoffs. I would have preferred De'Anthony Melton in a 3-and-D role for the Lakers' backcourt. If Melton is headed elsewhere -- he's been linked to rejoining the Golden State Warriors after ACL surgery ended his brief Warriors stint last season -- then bringing in Smart at a bargain deal is a reasonable plan B for Los Angeles. Adding Smart will reduce the Lakers' flexibility to add salary during the season. With 14 players under contract, they'll be barely $1 million away from their hard cap. The Lakers won't be able to fill their final NBA roster spot until January at the earliest and will be challenged to make trades that bring back more salary than they send out. Portland Trail Blazers agreed to a reported three-year, $42 million contract with guard Damian Lillard Grade: A- Lillard's return to Portland is a feel-good ending to an unhappy chapter with the Milwaukee Bucks that culminated in an Achilles injury and Lillard's release with two years remaining on his contract. Given the opportunity to pick his destination as a free agent for the first time in his career, Lillard opted to go back to where he starred over his first 11 NBA seasons and where his family and children still reside. In basketball terms, Lillard will be an interesting fit for a Blazers team that found a new identity without him during the second half of last season. Portland acquired Toumani Camara as part of the Lillard deal and turned the players and picks acquired from that trade into Deni Avdija , the two leading contributors to the Blazers going 23-18 in the second half of last season. Now, Portland has both Jrue Holiday (part of the return for Lillard, traded to the Boston Celtics days later and then reacquired this summer for Anfernee Simons ) and Lillard along with the young talent those trades produced -- with more Milwaukee first-round picks and swaps still to convey. Given the timing of his left Achilles rupture in late April, it's unlikely Lillard will play a significant role for the Blazers this season. No NBA player since JJ Barea in 2019 has returned from an Achilles rupture faster than 10½ months after the injury, a timetable that would put Lillard back in mid-March at the earliest. Still, after striking a buyout with center Deandre Ayton -- another part of the Lillard deal -- on the eve of free agency, Portland could afford to use its non-taxpayer midlevel exception to pay Lillard on top of his $54 million guaranteed salary from the Bucks without going into the tax. This deal is really about having Lillard back for 2026-27, when a healthy version would have potentially commanded more than the $14 million the Blazers will pay him. By then, Portland should have a better idea of how its backcourt shakes out. The Simons trade should create more on-ball opportunities for Scoot Henderson during his third season, while the Blazers will know how much Holiday has left in the tank and the long-term future of shooting guard Shaedon Sharpe . Sharpe can be a restricted free agent next summer if he doesn't agree to an extension before the start of this season. There's still work for Portland to do, particularly if the team wants to be a player in free agency next summer. With Lillard's salary on the books, plus a $25.2 million cap hold for Sharpe, the Blazers might be better off staying over the cap as things stand. If Portland can get out of the final two years of veteran forward Jerami Grant 's contract, however, it's possible the Blazers could open cap space for a run at another contributor. Give Lillard credit for negotiating a favorable deal. If Lillard comes back at a high level in 2026-27, a player option for the final season of this contract will allow him to collect more money the following season, when he's no longer being paid by Milwaukee. And after going to a destination that wasn't his initial target in the 2023 trade, Lillard got a no-trade clause, joining LeBron James as the only players in the league with one after Bradley Beal's was extinguished when he agreed to a buyout with the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday. LA Clippers agreed to a reported two-year, $11 million contract with guard Bradley Beal Grade: B+ The Clippers have finally completed the second step in the plan we anticipated when they traded starting shooting guard Norman Powell to the Miami Heat last week in a deal that netted forward/center John Collins . With an open position in their lineup alongside James Harden in the backcourt, the Clippers became an obvious landing spot for Beal whenever he completed a buyout agreement with the Phoenix Suns . Powell was the better player last season, providing stronger efficiency on higher usage than Beal, who finished second in the league in scoring as recently as 2020-21 but transitioned to a complementary role in Phoenix. One surprising stat: Powell, who is coming off a career year, is a month older than Beal. Still, I can get why the Clippers preferred having both Beal and Collins to Powell and whoever else they could have added using the remainder of their non-taxpayer midlevel exception, even if it cost them a second-round pick (sent to the Utah Jazz in the trade) to make that exchange. Although he's no longer an All-Star, Beal's skill set scales down well. More of a volume 3-point shooter during his high-scoring days with the Washington Wizards , Beal hit 41% of his 3s during two seasons with the Suns. And with his role on offense diminished, Beal put more of his energy toward creating for others and defense, two important factors for the Clippers. Specifically, Beal's most important benefit to the Clippers seems to be leading a second-unit backcourt alongside Bogdan Bogdanovic with Harden on the bench. Without a traditional point guard behind Harden at the moment -- though Chris Paul remains an unrestricted free agent -- the Clippers appear headed toward having Beal and Bogdanovic fill that role by committee. Though the idea of Beal as a starting point guard lost its luster in Phoenix, he and Bogdanovic should provide sufficient playmaking against second units. Presumably, the Clippers will at least begin the season accomplishing that goal by staggering Beal's minutes with Harden's after they start together in the backcourt. It's hard to see Beal signing up for a return to the bench after unhappily playing that role during the second half of last season. Come the playoffs, assuming the Clippers get there in a loaded Western Conference, Ty Lue's decisions on which players to start could become more complicated. Starting Collins alongside Ivica Zubac in the frontcourt might be the Clippers' best option, but that would leave Kawhi Leonard as the team's primary wing defender, a role the Clippers probably want to take off his plate as much as possible to keep Leonard fresh for offense. Kris Dunn or Derrick Jones Jr . might fit better starting on the wing than Beal in that scenario. At this point, we'll consider that a good problem. The Clippers have an 82-game regular season to get through, and their depth will be important given the amount of time Beal -- who last played more than 53 games in the shortened 2020-21 campaign -- and Leonard tend to miss. Adding Beal at a max salary, particularly given the complication of his no-trade clause, proved a net negative for the Suns. The story is different now that the Clippers are getting him at a wildly different price point, with a player option giving Beal the chance to make up the money he gave back in a buyout or potentially even come out ahead if he plays well this season. It's worth addressing the Phoenix side of the equation. To some degree, the Suns might have benefited from the NBA rule limiting how much dead salary teams can have on their books after completing a waive-and-stretch. That meant Beal had to agree to reduce his guaranteed salary by nearly $14 million at a minimum for a legal buyout of this type, putting a floor on negotiations. Like the Milwaukee Bucks with Damian Lillard , the Suns will have Beal's salary on their books for five years if they agree to stretch it, with the upside of possibly getting out of the luxury tax altogether, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. Before we see how Phoenix responds, I wouldn't take this as an indication that owner Mat Ishbia is retrenching on spending along the lines of what we saw with Mikhail Prokhorov in Brooklyn after the Nets' trade for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce went bust. After all, the limitations on teams spending over the second luxury tax apron in the new collective bargaining agreement mean there are basketball benefits to the Suns reducing their payroll by stretching Beal's salary. In fact, they could use the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel exception now, though it's unclear there are any free agents remaining that would sign up for that but not the veteran's minimum. Getting out of the second apron will allow Phoenix to aggregate salaries in trades and mean the Suns will have access to their non-taxpayer midlevel exception next summer if they lose center Mark Williams as a restricted free agent or he re-signs for his qualifying offer. I'm still not sure stretching Beal's salary will prove better for the Suns on the court in the long term than just riding out his remaining two seasons, but given how unpleasant his time in Phoenix seemed for both sides, I understand the desire to simply move on. Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to a five-year, maximum extension with forward Jalen Williams Grade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale) The third and presumably final max rookie extension for a 2022 first-round pick essentially split the difference between the first two. Like Paolo Banchero of the Orlando Magic , the other 2022 first-rounder to make an All-Star Game, Williams received 30% max criteria in his deal that will increase its value to a maximum of a projected $287 million if he makes All-NBA first team this season or is voted MVP or Defensive Player of the Year. Given Williams was an All-NBA third-team pick last season at age 23, the Thunder should certainly prepare as if he'll make more than the 25% max teammate Chet Holmgren will get on his max extension, agreed to Wednesday. As with Holmgren, Williams did not get the player option that Banchero secured in his extension. That's especially important as Oklahoma City plans well into the future. Williams wouldn't begin a potential supermax extension -- or hit unrestricted free agency -- until 2031-32 at the earliest. Given Williams has accomplished more through three seasons than Banchero, including averaging 23.6 points in the NBA Finals, he certainly had a case for securing a player option. From a big-picture standpoint, the Thunder now have both Holmgren and Williams under contract through 2030-31 and MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander signed through 2029-30 (with a player option for 2030-31) after he completed his own supermax extension last week. The size of those contracts, which guarantee the three players approximately 85% of the salary cap when Gilgeous-Alexander's deal begins in 2027-28, will present challenges to Oklahoma City maintaining its depth. But the Thunder have been planning for that moment since before drafting Holmgren and Williams and have the financial flexibility and draft picks to ensure continued contention throughout their stars' prime years. Phoenix Suns agreed to a reported two-year, max extension with guard Devin Booker Grade: Fail (extensions graded pass/fail) This extension adds two years to Booker's contract, which already runs through 2027-28, starting at the maximum 35% of the cap when it's set in the summer of 2028. Currently, that's estimated at $70 million, which could be the largest salary in the NBA depending on how much the cap grows from the 2026-27 season, when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander begins a supermax extension. It doesn't take advanced statistical projections to suggest that Booker will probably not merit a $70 million-plus salary. Despite playing 75 games last season, his most since 2016-17, Booker was neither chosen an All-Star nor to an All-NBA team. He's made All-NBA just twice in his career and only received MVP votes once. (That came in 2021-22, when Booker finished fourth in the voting and was chosen for the All-NBA first team.) During his prime, Booker has been more like a top 25 NBA player than a top 10 one. And while he should still be an All-Star contender by the time this extension kicks in, shortly before his 32nd birthday, it's more likely that Booker will be a complementary piece than the centerpiece the Suns have made him. It's understandable that Phoenix would value a star player who wants to be there after the Suns traded Kevin Durant and as they consider a buyout for Bradley Beal . Booker has played his entire career in Phoenix and was the most important catalyst as the Suns went from 10 consecutive seasons in the lottery to the 2021 NBA Finals. Yes, Chris Paul was key to that season, but Paul likely would not have come to Phoenix without the promise Booker showed. Still, Booker's loyalty didn't translate into any kind of discount, and the Suns are taking a considerable risk by agreeing to this extension with so much time remaining on Booker's current contract. One key question in evaluating any extension is whether a player will have more trade value after striking the deal. In this case, because Booker will get the maximum raise between the two seasons of the deal, he won't be tradeable for six months. The question is more a hypothetical one. I suspect Booker would have more value to other teams on his current contract. Certainly, Phoenix hopes that question is moot and the team can rebuild a contender around him. In the event the Suns' missing draft picks and a potential stretch of Beal's contract doom them to remain in the lottery, either Booker's commitment to The Valley or his trade value might be tested before this extension even begins. Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to a reported five-year, max rookie extension with center Chet Holmgren Grade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail) Compared with the other two max rookie extensions we expect from the 2022 first round -- one for Paolo Banchero reported Monday and one yet to be completed with Holmgren's Thunder teammate Jalen Williams -- this was a bit less of a no-brainer. From a performance standpoint, Holmgren has met expectations since being drafted No. 2 behind Banchero. He finished second to Victor Wembanyama in Rookie of the Year voting and was one of three double-figure scorers for Oklahoma City during the team's championship run. Given Holmgren's ability to impact a game at both ends with his 37% career 3-point shooting and 2.3 blocks per game, there's a case to be made that he has been more effective on a per-minute basis than Banchero despite not being named to an All-Star team. Yet durability remains a concern with Holmgren, who has missed extended periods due to a pair of rare, serious injuries -- a Lisfranc fracture that sidelined him his entire first NBA season and a hip fracture in November. He has played just 114 regular-season games, compared with 198 for Banchero and 215 for Williams. Nobody knows Holmgren's medicals better than the Thunder, however, and given their record as a front office, I'm inclined to believe them that his fluke injuries don't tell us anything about his health going forward despite any concerns about his thin frame. Although Holmgren got the max, the Thunder held the line in other areas. Holmgren did not get a player option like Banchero, and even if he reaches 30% max criteria by winning MVP or Defensive Player of the Year or making an All-NBA team, Holmgren's extension will start at 25% of the cap. By contrast, Banchero could reach the full 30% max, projected at $287 million. As Oklahoma City prepares for a financial future that includes a supermax extension struck last week with MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander plus a coming extension for Williams, those wins on the edges could be crucial. At the same time, Holmgren is assured life-changing money no matter what happens with his health, making this deal a win-win. The Orlando Magic agreed to a reported five-year, $239 max extension with forward Paolo Banchero . Grade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail) That sound you just heard is the Oklahoma City Thunder 's front office yelling in frustration about Banchero becoming the first player to get an option in a max rookie extension since Luka Doncic and Trae Young both did in 2021. That precedent could be relevant as the Thunder negotiate with the two other 2022 first-round picks likely to get max extensions: Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams . There are, generally speaking, two points of negotiation on what ESPN's Brian Windhorst has termed the \"fun\" max for players concluding their rookie contracts. One is eligibility for 30% max criteria that boost the starting value of the extension from the typical 25% to as high as 30% if the player earns All-NBA honors, MVP or Defensive Player of the Year. Banchero also received this in his new deal. The other negotiating point is a player option, and teams have held the line there since Doncic and Young. Anthony Edwards didn't get one coming off making the All-Star team in his third season. Nor did Ja Morant , the most accomplished player at the same stage of his career since Doncic and Young, after Morant made the All-NBA second team in Year 3. Certainly, Banchero is a promising young player in his own right. The No. 1 draft pick in 2022, he made his All-Star debut at age 21 and improved his statistical output last season. An oblique tear in October prevented Banchero from making a run at becoming the first player since Doncic with multiple All-Star appearances in his first three seasons. Still, there's a gap between Doncic -- an All-NBA first-team pick in his second and third campaigns -- and Banchero, who has yet to finish in the top 20 in All-NBA voting. (He wasn't eligible last season following the injury.) I'm surprised the Magic weren't able to lean on the recent track record to strike a deal without a player option, which could allow Banchero to escalate his salary to the supermax a year earlier, if he qualifies, or potentially become an unrestricted free agent in 2030 near his peak at age 27. That follows Orlando giving Franz Wagner a max extension last summer, before he'd earned corresponding accolades. Wagner probably would have merited a max offer sheet as a restricted free agent this offseason, though the Brooklyn Nets were the only team that could plausibly make such an offer. In the wake of Banchero joining No. 3 pick Jabari Smith Jr. as the second player drafted in the 2022 first round to strike an extension, it's worth watching the Thunder's duo of Holmgren (drafted between Banchero and Smith) and Williams. No. 12 pick Williams is the other All-Star from the 2022 draft, and his play as Oklahoma City won the NBA championship gives him a strong case for a player option on his own max deal. Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a reported two-year contract with center Deandre Ayton Grade: B+ After agreeing to a buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers , Ayton seemed like a fit for the Lakers, and not just because of the symmetry of pairing the No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft with No. 3 pick Luka Doncic . (No. 2 pick Marvin Bagley III is a free agent if the Lakers want to complete the trio.) At nearly 27 years old, Ayton is substantially younger than the Lakers' other center options using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception. Realistically, the Lakers were looking at 39-year-old Al Horford or 37-year-old Brook Lopez , with Luke Kornet (soon to be 30) as the other candidate. If things work out, Ayton could be a long-term option for the Lakers in the way the veterans are not while also supplying more of a lob threat for Doncic in the pick-and-roll. We saw with Jaxson Hayes last season how powerful vertical spacing can be in the context of a Lakers offense with Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves as pick-and-roll ball handlers. Hayes shot 74% after the All-Star break, averaging 13.4 points per 36 minutes -- up from 11.8 before break. But the rest of Hayes' skill set wasn't starter caliber, which explains why he quickly fell out of coach J.J. Redick's rotation during the opening round of the playoffs. Hayes did not reach 10 minutes in any game against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was a DNP-CD in the deciding Game 5. Ayton was one of the NBA's most prolific pick-and-roll finishers during his time with the Phoenix Suns , ranking third in points scored as a screen setter in both 2021-22 and 2022-23, according to GeniusIQ tracking. Ayton hasn't been nearly as effective running pick-and-roll with the Blazers' ball handlers and weaker spacing the past two seasons, shooting just 58% on resulting shot attempts as compared to 62% over his last three years in Phoenix. Although Ayton is only a marginal upgrade over Hayes as a rim protector, his superior size makes Ayton a better defensive rebounder. That should keep Ayton on the court against playoff-caliber opposition. By splitting the non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Ayton and Jake LaRavia , the Lakers have gone from five players Redick trusted during the playoffs -- a group that included Dorian Finney-Smith , who left for the Houston Rockets as an unrestricted free agent -- to hopefully six. Going beyond that number will depend on the development of the Lakers' young talent, most notably Dalton Knecht , and in-season moves. James' decision to exercise his $52.6 million player option rather than potentially re-signing for the $54.1 million maximum salary for players with 10-plus years of experience leaves the Lakers with some wiggle room below the lower luxury-tax apron, which will serve as a hard cap for them because they used the non-taxpayer midlevel. If the Lakers keep 14 players on their roster and waive Shake Milton , whose $3 million salary is non-guaranteed, they can add about $5 million in salary via trade or the biannual exception. Depending on what James thinks of Ayton, those moves might not be sufficient to convince him the Lakers have built a championship-caliber roster after losing in the first round. The Lakers have their 2031 first-round pick or potential swaps in 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032 that could turn the expiring contracts of Maxi Kleber and Gabe Vincent into significant contributors -- the kind of win-now move James would surely prefer they make in his age-41 season. Without knowing exactly what's on the table for the Lakers, I think signing Ayton is the right call for now. He increases their playoff ceiling if accepting a buyout from Portland and signing for a small fraction of his previous max salary gets Ayton to buy in to a degree we haven't seen since he helped the Suns to the 2021 Finals. Meanwhile, waiting will give the Lakers more information about what they need and who might become available by the trade deadline. If the Lakers put their unprotected pick and swaps on the table, they should be able to add a starting-caliber player at that point. Of course, I'm not the person the Lakers need to convince. Nor is James, no matter how many statements he and agent Rich Paul release. The real pivot point for the Lakers' offseason will be Doncic's decision on signing an extension ahead of what could be the final season of his contract. Doncic is eligible for an extension starting Aug. 2, and that's when we'll really be able to grade the Lakers. Charlotte Hornets agreed to re-sign guard Tre Mann to a reported three-year, $24 million deal; agreed to a reported one-year deal with guard Spencer Dinwiddie Grades Mann: B- Dinwiddie: B When the Hornets acquired Collin Sexton from the Utah Jazz on Sunday, I wrote that Sexton's addition addressed a Charlotte need for playmaking with LaMelo Ball on the bench. After bringing back Mann and adding Dinwiddie, the Hornets appear insistent on ensuring that issue never comes up this season. A season-ending injury to Mann in November was a big factor in that weakness. In 13 games before experiencing disc irritation that eventually required surgery, Mann averaged 14.1 PPG in just 24.5 MPG off the bench. That was fueled in part by 40% 3-point shooting, which Charlotte can't necessarily expect to continue. Mann has shot 35% over his four-year career. Despite that quibble, there's reason to believe Mann can carve out a key role as a bench scorer. He had a nice 28-game run for the Hornets as a starter after being acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder at the 2024 trade deadline while shooting a more modest 36% on 3s. Mann averaged 5.2 APG in that role, an encouraging sign of his ability to create for others. A first-round pick by the Thunder in 2021, Mann is still just 24. As long as he stays healthy, Mann should have more development in front of him. The Luka Doncic trade and Kyrie Irving 's ACL tear thrust Dinwiddie into an unexpectedly large role with the Dallas Mavericks last season. He started 30 games and played 2,000-plus minutes for the third consecutive season. That role surely overexposed Dinwiddie, who fell out of the team's rotation for the play-in. As a fifth guard in Charlotte, Dinwiddie is overqualified to serve as injury insurance. Adding him does create a roster jam for the Hornets, who had 10 players under guaranteed contract including Mann, plus four draft picks and three players on non-guaranteed deals. Charlotte could waive Pat Connaughton after acquiring him from the Milwaukee Bucks in a salary-related deal, while the Hornets might also move on from Josh Okogie 's non-guaranteed $7.75 million deal. Milwaukee Bucks agreed to a reported four-year, $107 million deal with center Myles Turner Grade: B- For multiple reasons, this is the most truly shocking development in NBA free agency perhaps since Paul George was traded to the LA Clippers in 2019, convincing Kawhi Leonard to simultaneously sign with the Clippers weeks after winning MVP of the NBA Finals. Turner seemed like a lock to re-sign with the Indiana Pacers , having started Game 7 of the NBA Finals for them nine days ago . Meanwhile, the Bucks' ambitions in free agency seemed much more modest after an opening day of free agency that suggested they would stay over the cap and use the non-taxpayer midlevel exception to replace departed starter Brook Lopez . With two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo monitoring their offseason to evaluate his future in Milwaukee, the Bucks thought far bigger. Bigger in part as the biggest waive and stretch in NBA history involving Damian Lillard , whose entire $112.6 million extension that begins today will be stretched over five seasons, sitting on Milwaukee's cap sheet for $22.5 million through 2029-30. That move alone isn't enough to create the cap room necessary for the Bucks to sign Turner to this deal. Milwaukee subsequently agreed to a trade sending Pat Connaughton to the Charlotte Hornets with draft picks for Vasilije Micic . If Milwaukee can agree to a buyout with Micic, whose interest in returning to Europe was reported during last season, that should make up the difference. In many ways, Turner is like a younger version of Lopez, whose signing helped kick-start this era of Bucks contention. Having a center who can both protect the rim and take that responsibility off Antetokounmpo's plate and stretch the floor for him on offense is the ideal scenario for Milwaukee. Besides Lopez, who is 37, the only other center in free agency who fills both of those roles is Al Horford -- who is two years older than Lopez. That made Turner, 29, the only real option for the Bucks to pair with Antetokounmpo through the rest of what they hope will be the remainder of his prime spent in Milwaukee. Turner is coming off the best 3-point season of his career, having averaged 2.2 per game at a 40% clip, and his career 36% accuracy is a tad better than what Lopez shot over his entire seven seasons with the Bucks. Turner's defensive upside isn't quite as high as Lopez's. He topped out at fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting, where Lopez was second in 2022-23. But Turner was often asked to serve as the only rim protector for the Pacers before Pascal Siakam 's arrival. He has never played with a secondary defender as strong as Antetokounmpo. And opponents shot slightly better against the slowing Lopez inside five feet last year, per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats , than they did against Turner. Certainly, the contrast between Lopez and Turner was on full display when the two centers met in the first round of the playoffs. Turner averaged 16.8 PPG and 2.2 BPG as Indiana won the series in five games, part of a strong postseason run. Lopez totaled just eight points and one block in the final three games against the Pacers, yielding his starting job to backup Bobby Portis for what proved to be Lopez's final game in Milwaukee. That said, Lopez wasn't the only reason, or even the primary reason, the Bucks lost that series. Their starting wing duo of Kyle Kuzma and Taurean Prince was invisible against Indiana, combining for 35 points on 14-of-45 shooting. Milwaukee hasn't yet done anything to address that weakness. If the Bucks are as serious about contending as this move suggests, it's imperative that they use their remaining draft assets (an unprotected 2032 first-round pick, plus a swap in 2031 or re-swapping picks that either the New Orleans Pelicans or Portland Trail Blazers can swap) to upgrade from Kuzma. Cam Johnson , perhaps the cleanest replacement, is already off the board after a trade agreed to Monday sent him to the Denver Nuggets . Failing that, while I credit Milwaukee for creativity and boldness of this move, I'm not sure the Bucks are much closer to championship contention. Waiving Lillard takes away the upside of him potentially returning from an Achilles rupture in the playoffs to play at a high level. Turner, the third option at best in the Pacers' offense, is now the only player besides Antetokounmpo on the roster who averaged even 15 points last season. If Antetokounmpo decides at some point he's ready to move on from Milwaukee, the good news is Turner should have more trade value on this contract than Lillard would have making the max. The downside is the Bucks' eventual rebuild will be saddled by not controlling their own draft picks and by the cap hit for the Lillard stretch. Milwaukee might not be able to stretch players making appreciable salary for the next five years because of the CBA rule that limits teams to 15% of the current cap as dead salary after a stretch is completed. The news is worse for the Pacers, who lost a key contributor to their Finals run in his late prime. Indiana should now be able to use the full $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel to replace Turner without pushing into the luxury tax, whereas matching this offer to Turner would have required the Pacers to trade one of their rotation players to avoid the tax. Still, if ever there was a time for a small-market team like Indiana to pay the tax, it's coming off getting within one win of a championship. Tyrese Haliburton 's Achilles rupture in Game 7 of the NBA Finals changes expectations for the Pacers next season, but Turner would have remained a valuable starter beyond Haliburton's return to full strength in 2026-27. Already, center depth was one of Indiana's biggest needs after two backups ( Isaiah Jackson and James Wiseman ) suffered Achilles ruptures during the 2024-25 regular season. The Pacers alternated journeymen Thomas Bryant (an unrestricted free agent) and Tony Bradley (whose team option was exercised) in the playoffs. So there's no replacement for Turner on the roster in the short or long term. Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to a reported four-year, supermax extension for guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Grade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail) The NBA added the so-called \"supermax\" designated veteran extension to the 2017 collective bargaining agreement in large part because of Kevin Durant leaving the Thunder for the Golden State Warriors in 2016, so it's fitting Oklahoma City now benefits from being able to use the supermax with another MVP. Back then, restrictive rules around raises in extensions and the salary-cap jump precipitated by new national TV deals made a Durant extension unrealistic even had he preferred to stay with the Thunder. The situation is dramatically different now, meaning the only question was whether Gilgeous-Alexander would sign the supermax this summer or wait until next year when he could have added a fifth year to his contract. In an ideal world, Gilgeous-Alexander might have taken slightly less than the full 35% of the cap that a supermax extension allows as a starting point. (The actual value of the contract, currently projected at $285 million by ESPN's Bobby Marks, won't be known until the salary cap is set for the 2027-28 season.) Gilgeous-Alexander has earned every penny of the supermax, certainly, and Oklahoma City is more prepared than any team in NBA history has been for its stars to get raises. In addition to Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams and starter Chet Holmgren are eligible for rookie extensions this summer that will kick in for 2026-27. Knowing these contracts were coming, Oklahoma City has been looking ahead for years with team options and contracts that decrease on an annual basis, giving the Thunder the flexibility to shed salary without needing to pay for the privilege. And the unprecedented stockpile of first-round picks Oklahoma City accumulated during its rebuild means the team will continue incorporating cheaper contributors to replace parts of the 2025 champions and stay in contention throughout Gilgeous-Alexander's prime years. Milwaukee Bucks agreed to a reported two-year deal with guard Gary Harris ; agreed to a reported two-year deal with center Jericho Sims Grades Harris grade: C Sims grade: B- After Tuesday's stunning pair of moves -- waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his salary to make room to sign center Myles Turner -- the Bucks continued filling out their roster later in the day. At this point, Harris is a bigger name than he is as a contributor. Harris averaged just 14.8 minutes on an Orlando Magic team desperate for perimeter production last season and scored just 3.0 points. A regular starter as recently as the 2023-24 season, Harris could sop up bench minutes in a 3-and-D role but doesn't really fill a need for Milwaukee. If anything, shooting guard is probably the strongest part of the Bucks' depth chart outside of power forward. Milwaukee agreed to re-sign Gary Trent Jr . Monday and still has sharpshooter AJ Green , two of the five players coach Doc Rivers trusted by the end of the Bucks' first-round series against the Indiana Pacers . Green and Trent combined for 14 3-pointers and 52 points in Game 5. Sims, acquired midseason from the New York Knicks , also featured in the rotation ahead of Brook Lopez . Sims gave Milwaukee some good minutes during Bobby Portis ' NBA suspension and is a reliable third center. The biggest quibble here is how many player options the Bucks are handing out this summer. Trent, Kevin Porter Jr . and Taurean Prince also got so-called \"one-plus-one deals\" with a player option for 2026-27. Several teams got burned by player options they handed out in the summer of 2023, which saddled them with underperformers clogging up roster spots. Milwaukee risks the same issue, and I'm not sure Harris and Sims are better enough than the alternative choices to merit getting player options. New York Knicks agreed to a reported two-year, $12 million contract with forward/center Guerschon Yabusele Grade: B Yabusele was a rare bright spot in the Philadelphia 76ers ' lost season. Back in the NBA for the first time since 2019 after starring for the French national team in the Olympics, Yabusele started 43 games on a minimum contract and averaged 11.0 points and 5.6 rebounds. With the Sixers pushing the luxury tax before re-signing restricted free agent Quentin Grimes , Yabusele was expendable in free agency. Enter the Knicks, who will add him to a frontcourt rotation of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Karl-Anthony Towns . Stretched as a center in place of Joel Embiid for Philadelphia because he's not a rim protector at all (0.5 blocks per 36 minutes), Yabusele should fit better in New York. We saw during the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers the benefit to the Knicks of playing with more size in the frontcourt than the 6-foot-4 Hart provides. At 6-foot-8, Yabusele is a happy medium between Hart and playing Robinson and Towns together. And a Towns-Yabusele frontcourt will give New York five-out spacing. Yabusele hit 38% from 3-point range last season, attempting more than five 3s per 36 minutes. Utilizing the taxpayer midlevel exception to sign Yabusele will require some creative cap management from the Knicks. New York is pushing right up against the resulting hard cap at the second luxury tax apron and will likely take advantage of second-round picks counting less against the aprons in its first two seasons than other players signed for the minimum. As a result, the Knicks might be done maneuvering this summer barring a trade, with Yabusele and Jordan Clarkson as the veteran newcomers to the team that reached last year's conference finals. In a wide-open East, any boost they provide could make the difference for New York. And Yabusele is young enough at 29 to be a long-term option for the Knicks, who won't likely have access to their midlevel exception next summer if they extend the contract of forward Mikal Bridges and push into the second apron. Denver Nuggets agreed to a reported one-year deal with guard Tim Hardaway Jr . Grade: A- Clearly, these are no longer Calvin Booth's Nuggets. Hardaway was precisely the sort of veteran Booth preferred not to add to Denver's bench as GM , wanting those minutes given to recent draft picks Julian Strawther and Peyton Watson -- much to the dismay of former coach Michael Malone. Hardaway started all of his 77 games last season for the Detroit Pistons and averaged 31.3 minutes in the playoffs. Hardaway's role in Detroit's turnaround was overrated but apparently other NBA teams weren't moved, freeing the Nuggets to add him at a bargain price. Along with fellow free agent Bruce Brown and trade addition Jonas Valanciunas , Hardaway strengthens what's now looking like a deep Denver bench. As a volume 3-point shooter (2.2 per game last season, his fewest since 2016-17 but surpassed only by Jamal Murray and former Nugget Michael Porter Jr . among Denver players), Hardaway most clearly competes with Strawther. The 2023 first-round pick played just 88 minutes in the 2025 playoffs. If new Denver coach David Adelman couldn't trust Strawther in the playoffs, when the Nuggets' rotation shrunk to seven players at times, better to bring in someone Adelman will play. With 14 players now under contract, Denver seems just about finished with a makeover that has strengthened its chances of knocking off the Oklahoma City Thunder next spring. Toronto Raptors agreed to a reported four-year, $104 million extension with center Jakob Poeltl ; agreed to a reported two-year, $5.5 million deal with forward/center Sandro Mamukelashvili Grades Poeltl: Fail (extensions graded on pass/fail) Mamukelashvili: B+ Since sending what became the No. 8 pick of the 2024 draft to get Poeltl at the 2023 trade deadline, the Raptors have consistently valued him like an above-average starting center. Toronto re-signed Poeltl to a four-year, $78 million contract the following summer and is now giving him nearly the largest possible raise off that contract. Technically, Poeltl could have added $88.5 million on a three-year extension after exercising a $19.5 million player option for 2026-27. This deal pays him nearly but not quite that amount, adding $84.5 million in new money for the total of $104 million after this season. The Raptors can point to Poeltl's adjusted plus-minus impact as evidence of his value. According to xRAPM, from the co-creator of ESPN's Real Plus-Minus (Jerry Engelmann), Poeltl rates 2.2 points per 100 possessions better than league average, putting him in the 89th percentile leaguewide . There are two problems with applying that rating to Poeltl's extension. The first is it's unlikely the rest of the league values Poeltl as highly, so it's certainly possible Toronto could have gotten him back as an unrestricted free agent next summer (or in 2027) for less money and it's unlikely the Raptors would have been outbid. The second concern is how Poeltl will age. He'll be 32 when this extension kicks in for the 2027-28 season and 34 by the end of it. Already, Poeltl's rim protection hasn't rated as well since rejoining Toronto as it did with the San Antonio Spurs . Opponents have hit better than 60% of attempts inside the restricted area with Poeltl as the primary defender over the past three seasons, per GeniusIQ tracking, as compared to 53.5% in 2020-21 and 56% in 2021-22. From a bigger-picture standpoint, the Raptors continue to invest in a core that hasn't yet proved capable of making the playoffs. Poeltl gives Toronto four starters under contract for a combined $145 million in 2027-28, and granting that one of them ( Brandon Ingram , acquired at the trade deadline) has yet to make his Raptors debut, it's far from clear that this group is good enough to contend in the East. Given that context and the lack of urgency to extend Poeltl, I would have waited. This exact deal would not have been possible once the season started, but if Poeltl was willing to exercise his player option, Toronto could have executed an identical contract before the start of free agency next summer. In signing a deal that won't kick in for two years, I think the Raptors are taking on too much risk for too little reward. I'm much higher on the Mamukelashvili signing. He averaged 20.4 points per 36 minutes for the Spurs last season, including a 34-point outburst on 13-of-14 shooting against the New York Knicks in March. Mamukelashvili shooting 37% on a reasonable sample of 3-point attempts (161) was encouraging, since he has long been accurate inside the arc. If Mamukelashvili can shoot, I particularly like the idea of pairing him with either Jonathan Mogbo or Collin Murray-Boyles in second-unit frontcourts. Both supply the defensive playmaking that is a weakness for Mamukelashvili. For the cost, this is a worthwhile flier for Toronto. Sacramento Kings agreed to a reported three-year, $45 million contract with guard Dennis Schroder Grade: C- New Sacramento GM Scott Perry seemed to signal the Kings' pursuit of a point guard when he called the lack of a traditional playmaker an \"obvious need\" during his introduction to local media. Although that statement is hard to dispute, I'm not convinced playmaking was actually Sacramento's biggest shortcoming. After the Kings reshuffled their roster by trading De'Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs in a three-team deal that netted Zach LaVine as a replacement, they essentially filled point guard by committee. LaVine and nominal small forward DeMar DeRozan are capable ball handlers, as are guards Keon Ellis and Malik Monk . After the All-Star break, Sacramento did rank 25th in the NBA in assist rate. Then again, that's not necessarily such a bad thing. The 64-win Cleveland Cavaliers were one spot behind the Kings, while the LA Clippers (who went 19-9 after the break) were one spot ahead. Overall, Sacramento's 12th-ranked offense after the break was less of a factor in the team's 12-15 finish to end up in the play-in than rating 22nd in defensive rating over that span. To some degree, Schroder could help there. He's capable of providing full-court pressure on opposing ball handlers. Still, the 6-foot-1 Schroder makes the Kings even smaller on the perimeter, and he's certainly a downgrade defensively as compared to Ellis. Offensively, Schroder has always been better cast as a playmaker off the bench than as a starter. His value has fluctuated in large part with his 3-point percentage. Schroder shot 38.5% during 2019-20, when he averaged 18.9 points and finished second in Sixth Man of the Year voting, but he hasn't reached that height over a full season while playing for seven teams in five years -- not counting two separate stints with the Los Angeles Lakers . Schroder was at his best starting last season with the Brooklyn Nets , where he hit 39% of 3s and averaged 18.4 points and 6.6 rebounds. Schroder fit like oil and water with the remaining Splash Brother after a December trade to the Golden State Warriors , shooting 37.5% in 24 games for the Warriors before being sent to the Detroit Pistons in the Jimmy Butler III trade. Schroder played an important bench role for Detroit, averaging 12.5 points in the Pistons' hard-fought first-round loss to the New York Knicks . Whether Schroder fills the right need for Sacramento, the other question is handing out a three-year contract to a player who will turn 32 in September. Given how important Schroder's quickness is to his playmaking, any drop-off should be a major concern. Signing Schroder to this contract necessitated the Kings making the trade reported Tuesday sending backup center Jonas Valanciunas to the Denver Nuggets for Dario Saric , a clear downgrade in terms of on-court production justified only by Saric's smaller salary. Based on that cost, I undoubtedly would have preferred offering Tyus Jones a deal similar to the one he signed with the Orlando Magic for one year and $7 million. Memphis Grizzlies agreed to a five-year, $240 million renegotiation and extension with forward/center Jaren Jackson Jr .; agreed to re-sign forward Santi Aldama to a three-year, $52.5 million contract Grades Jackson: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail) Aldama: B- As part of what already has been a busy offseason and presumably isn't finished yet, the Grizzlies struck a pair of new deals with current players in the opening hours of free agency. Getting Jackson signed was the more pressing business for Memphis. Based on Jackson's existing $23.4 million salary in the final season of his contract, the Grizzlies could add a maximum of $147 million over four years on an extension after he fell short of qualifying for a supermax extension as a player with All-NBA honors. (Jackson was 17th in the voting, 13 points shy of making the third team.) Using cap space to renegotiate Jackson's 2025-26 salary upward allowed Memphis to make a more competitive extension offer. This structure presumably adds $10 million to Jackson's current contract, allowing his starting salary to bump up to $46 million or so in 2026-27. That's still shy of the max Jackson could have made as an unrestricted free agent next summer ($50 million, based on the NBA's updated projection of a 7% cap increase), but getting more money now helps make up that difference. All told, Jackson is adding $217 million in new money, as compared to the projected $219 million other teams could have offered on a four-max in 2026 free agency. Locking in the security of a massive deal now in a place Jackson wants to play is probably worth the modest difference. From the Grizzlies' perspective, this is still a huge win. They take the potential of Jackson leaving in free agency off the table, as well as the possibility of him qualifying for the supermax by making All-NBA next season. Creating cap space by moving Marcus Smart for expiring contracts at the trade deadline did cost Memphis a first-round pick, but I'd say that gamble paid off. Technically, the Grizzlies don't yet have the cap room necessary to complete this deal. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Memphis does not need to make a trade, suggesting the team will waive players and stretch its salary if no deal materializes before then. Doing so with reserve forward John Konchar wouldn't create quite enough space, so the Grizzlies are probably looking at letting newly acquired guard Cole Anthony go. If stretched, Anthony would count $5.2 million against Memphis' cap through 2029-30. Trading a player or stretching their salary is necessary to allow the Grizzlies to retain full Bird rights for Aldama, who averaged career highs in points (12.5), rebounds (6.4) and assists (2.9) per game in the final season of his rookie contract. Still just 24, Aldama figures to remain a key part of Memphis' rotation through the life of his contract. Given the limited amount of cap space available this summer and Aldama's modest qualifying offer ($5.9 million), it's possible the Grizzlies could have squeezed him more on this deal. Aldama will make far more than the $44 million that is the most other teams could have offered over this span using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception. The upside for Memphis is getting to structure Aldama's contract in a favorable manner. I'd guess his contract will start at its highest point before descending, allowing the Grizzlies to stuff as much salary as possible on their books for this season. Memphis is nowhere near the luxury-tax line and has plenty of flexibility to use its $8.8 million room exception to add a contributor. The Grizzlies have been linked to Cleveland Cavaliers guard Ty Jerome , an unrestricted free agent. Atlanta Hawks agreed to a reported four-year, $62 million contract with guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker via sign-and-trade; agreed to a reported one-year, $11 million deal with guard Luke Kennard Grades Alexander-Walker: A- Kennard: B The market for Alexander-Walker, already likely to be robust, surely benefited from the way the postseason played out. Having multiple point-of-attack defenders proved crucial in the late rounds of the playoffs because of the way teams utilized full-court, on-ball pressure. And if those defenders can make 3s, all the better. Alexander-Walker also helped his own cause with a strong series against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals, combining for 52 points in Games 2, 3 and 4 on 19-of-32 shooting. Those performances helped assure Alexander-Walker would be out of Minnesota's price range unless the Timberwolves were willing to let either Naz Reid or Julius Randle walk, making Alexander-Walker gettable as well as coveted. Ultimately, the Hawks utilized the $25 million trade exception they created in last summer's Dejounte Murray trade to offer Alexander-Walker ever so slightly more than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception, which topped out at $60.6 million over four years. Per ESPN's Shams Charania, Atlanta will send a Cleveland 2027 second-round draft pick and cash to Minnesota to complete the deal. That continues a strong offseason for the Hawks under first-year general manager Onsi Saleh. Atlanta previously added Kristaps Porzingis in a three-team trade that has yet to have officially been completed, as well as a valuable 2026 first-round pick in a draft-night deal. Alexander-Walker slides into the rotation spot vacated by Caris LeVert , who agreed Monday to sign with the Detroit Pistons on a similar two-year deal. Alexander-Walker is four years younger, making him a better fit for Atlanta's timetable. He also is capable of playing some point guard alongside Dyson Daniels , giving the Hawks a fearsome defensive backcourt when starter Trae Young is on the bench. Later Monday, Atlanta continued building its depth by adding Kennard on a one-year deal for $11 million. A 44% career 3-point shooter, Kennard led the league in accuracy in both 2021-22 and 2022-23. The Hawks now go four deep in the backcourt and are probably close to complete with their offseason moves. Before the dust settles, it's tough to say exactly where Atlanta ranks in the Eastern Conference. If Porzingis can stay on the court for most of the season, however, the Hawks look well-positioned to avoid the play-in tournament for the first time since reaching the 2021 East finals. And although the San Antonio Spurs own swap rights on Atlanta's first-round pick, the draft-night trade gives the Hawks a chance at lottery luck, too. LA Clippers agreed to a reported two-year, $16 million contract with center Brook Lopez Grade: A While we were all thinking about Lopez signing with the other Los Angeles team, he also makes a lot of sense for the Clippers, particularly on a contract that's appropriate for a backup center. For all their vaunted depth, the Clippers struggled last season when starter Ivica Zubac was on the bench. Lineups without Zubac were outscored by 5.5 points per 100 possessions, according to Cleaning the Glass , ranking in the 22nd percentile leaguewide in offensive rating. Compared with Mo Bamba , Zubac's backup to start 2024-25, Lopez is a far more credible shooting threat. \"Splash Mountain\" has made at least 130 3-pointers during each of the past three seasons. Lopez also is an occasional post-up threat against switches, something the Clippers could utilize given Zubac posted up more often than any player besides Nikola Jokic last season, per GeniusIQ tracking. Lopez will be an upgrade at the defensive end too, giving the Clippers 48 minutes of quality rim protection. Opponents shot 59% on attempts inside 5 feet with Lopez as a primary defender, per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats , not far off the 57% they shot against Zubac. The only concern here is that Lopez is 37. Given his strengths -- size and shooting -- tend to age better than any other skills, I'm not worried about a two-year contract for Lopez. Whatever aging risk exists is justified by the reward of getting a player who started all 80 games last season for less than $10 million per year. Milwaukee Bucks agreed to re-sign guard Kevin Porter Jr . to a two-year, $11 million deal; agreed to re-sign guard Gary Trent Jr . to a two-year, $7.5 million deal; agreed to re-sign forward Taurean Prince to a two-year, $7.1 million deal Grades Porter: B Prince: C Trent: A Having already agreed to a new deal with free agent Bobby Portis on Sunday, the Bucks brought back three more rotation players -- all of them coming off minimum contracts -- at modest prices Monday. Porter got the biggest raise after averaging 14.3 PPG and 4.7 APG in the 13 games after Damian Lillard was sidelined because of deep vein thrombosis at the end of the regular season. With Lillard expected to miss all of 2025-26 after an Achilles rupture, Porter projects as Milwaukee's starting point guard. Porter's talent is unquestionable. He played last season at the minimum after spending 2023-24 out of the league following a plea deal on assault and harassment charges stemming from a September 2023 incident. Porter had struggled to score efficiently before landing with the Bucks at the trade deadline in February. His 41% 3-point shooting the rest of the way isn't likely sustainable, but his career-best 53% accuracy inside the arc might be legit. Milwaukee using the biannual exception for his deal was a necessary part of the team's offseason plans. Like Porter, Trent was important in the Bucks' first-round series with the Indiana Pacers , topping 30 points twice in five games. For Milwaukee to get Trent back using non-Bird rights (a 20% raise off his minimum salary) is a huge win. Trent, meanwhile, will establish early Bird rights if he declines a 2026-27 player option. Prince was one of the noncontributors pushed out of the rotation against Indiana. After starting 73 games during the regular season, Prince played just 22 minutes over the last three games of the series after scoring a combined six points in Games 1 and 2. In that context, I'm a little surprised Prince earned a two-year deal with a player option. That means he'll count on the cap at his actual $3.3 million salary rather than the $2.3 million veteran's minimum. From a bigger-picture standpoint, the question is where the Bucks are heading by bringing back their 2025 playoff rotation minus departed Brook Lopez . Milwaukee has enough room under the lower luxury tax apron to use its $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception to sign a replacement for Lopez, with Deandre Ayton a reasonable target. But none of this makes up for the loss of Lillard, let alone improves on a Bucks team that hasn't won a playoff series since 2022. There are still opportunities for Milwaukee to make trades. Barring something stunning, however, the Bucks look no closer to competing for a championship. San Antonio Spurs agreed to a reported four-year, $41 million deal with center Luke Kornet Grade: B+ On the surface, the Spurs signing a center when they already have Victor Wembanyama seems nonsensical, but adding Kornet is reasonable on multiple levels. The biggest long-term need for San Antonio is probably a combo forward who can shoot, handle the ball and defend multiple positions. Alas, if that player existed in free agency, he surely would be out of the Spurs' price range. The realistic option for San Antonio was more likely Guerschon Yabusele , Wembanyama's teammate on the French national team. At center, the Spurs could shop closer to the top of the market. Kornet was prominent on the list ESPN's Zach Kram compiled Monday of underrated free agents. Advanced metrics have consistently shown Kornet making a major impact with his rim protection and high-percentage finishing. Since taking the 3-pointer out of his game, Kornet has shot 68% over the past three seasons. Meanwhile, as Kram highlighted, opponents shot just 52% against Kornet within 5 feet, according to GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats , putting him in the top 10 alongside Wembanyama among players who defended at least 100 such attempts. Adding Kornet addresses San Antonio's biggest weakness last season: defending with Wembanyama on the bench. The Spurs' defensive rating ranked in the 73rd percentile with Wembanyama on the court and dropped to the 9th percentile without him. Improving that weakness is the fastest way for San Antonio to reach the playoffs. Beyond that, I suspect Kornet should play with Wembanyama at times, too. The Spurs ditched playing Wembanyama as a power forward last season after they struggled with him next to Zach Collins as a rookie. Per my analysis of lineup data from NBA Advanced Stats, Wembanyama played exclusively at center in 2024-25. Still, I think it's worth revisiting with a better center option and more shot creation around them. Double-big lineups were effective for several teams last season and are worth exploring for San Antonio. Even if Kornet is strictly a backup center, I'd rather have him on this deal than nearly all the older big men who agreed to similar contracts Monday or the more defensively challenged players who re-signed over the weekend ( Bobby Portis and Naz Reid ). The Spurs can maximize Kornet's long-term value by starting his contract at its highest point and descending it, meaning a lower salary when Wembanyama is off his rookie deal and the luxury tax becomes a concern. Denver Nuggets agreed to a reported contract with guard/forward Bruce Brown Jr. Grade: B+ A reunion between Brown and the Nuggets was one of the more obvious free agent fits. Neither side has done as well since Brown's season in Denver resulted in an NBA championship. An unrestricted free agent that summer, Brown cashed in with a two-year, $45 million deal from the Indiana Pacers that the Nuggets couldn't match. The deal paid off for the Pacers, who flipped Brown as part of their trade for Pascal Siakam , but Brown has seen his production dip in the past two seasons. A 36% 3-point shooter in Denver, Brown has hit just 33% the past two seasons, and his accuracy dipped inside the arc last season, too. It's possible that defending bigger opponents could be taking a toll on the 6-foot-4 Brown, who will turn 29 this summer. There's a track record of players who are undersized for their position -- Brown has often played forward, and occasionally even power forward during his time with the Brooklyn Nets earlier in his career -- aging early as they lose the quickness needed to compensate. Alternatively, the Nuggets are surely hoping Brown just needs to get back to the ball movement that a Nikola Jokic -led offense provides. Brown's ability to cut and read the game fit well with Jokic. The price is also right. Per league sources, Denver signed Brown for the veteran's minimum, leaving the Nuggets free to use part of their non-taxpayer midlevel exception on another player after agreeing to trade Michael Porter Jr . for Cameron Johnson on Monday. Detroit Pistons agreed to a reported two-year, $29 million contract with guard Caris LeVert ; agreed to re-sign center Paul Reed to a reported two-year, $11 million contract Grades LeVert: B- Reed: B The Pistons had to be stunned by the news Sunday that Malik Beasley is under investigation by the United States District Attorney's office on allegations of gambling related to NBA games and prop bets. Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the Pistons were discussing a new three-year, $42 million contract for Beasley after he finished as the runner-up for the Sixth Man of the Year Award after he signed a one-year deal. Detroit pivoted to LeVert, who also has been among the league's top reserve guards in recent seasons. LeVert averaged 14.0 PPG and 5.1 APG in 2023-24 with the Cleveland Cavaliers before his playing time declined last season due to Ty Jerome 's emergence. LeVert is a shooting downgrade compared with Beasley. LeVert is a career 34.5% 3-point shooter, albeit an improved one during his time in Cleveland (36%). LeVert will provide more ballhandling and on-ball defense, important skills that probably aren't as valuable as Beasley's shooting to a Pistons team that will presumably use Jaden Ivey in a reserve role next season. Detroit might not have a good option with Beasley unavailable. Nickeil Alexander-Walker , who landed with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday -- essentially replacing LeVert -- was probably the best alternative, but winning a bidding war for him might have required the Pistons to use cap space. Detroit can sign LeVert using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception, enabling the Pistons to re-sign starting wing Tim Hardaway Jr . using Bird rights. Additionally, Detroit is bringing back Reed, who served as the Pistons' backup center for much of last season. Reed's active defense makes him a reliable option in that role, and the price is reasonable for a team that is nowhere near the luxury tax. Houston Rockets agreed to a reported three-year, $21.5 million contract with center Clint Capela Grade: D+ This move, which seemed logical a few weeks ago, was a surprise after the Rockets also extended backup center Steven Adams ' contract. Adams and Capela seemed like an either/or proposition for Houston because the two players don't offer positional versatility, though starting center Alperen Sengun moved to power forward alongside Adams in the playoffs. The upside is that the Rockets can manage the minutes of both players. Adams did not typically see action in both ends of back-to-back games last season, and Capela averaged just 21.4 MPG -- his fewest since emerging as a starter in Houston nearly a decade ago. Adding Capela likely ensures that the Rockets will pay the luxury tax this season, the latest sign they're going for it after adding Kevin Durant via trade rather than trying to delay the start of paying repeater taxes toward the primes for Sengun and Amen Thompson . Capela's contract will likely push Houston to the edge of a hard cap at the lower luxury tax apron, limiting the team's flexibility to add salary midseason. The bigger issues with paying two backup centers will come later, when more of the Rockets' young players are on extensions. Houston might try to add salary before it gets more difficult because of apron restrictions, but that logic would make more sense with younger players than Adams and Capela, who both are more likely to hold their value. Chicago Bulls agreed to re-sign guard Tre Jones to a reported three-year, $24 million contract Grade: B+ Jones quietly excelled in 18 games for the Bulls after being included in the trade that sent De'Aaron Fox to San Antonio and Zach LaVine to Sacramento. Jones averaged 11.5 PPG and 4.9 APG for Chicago, shooting 57% overall, 11-of-22 on 3s and 88% on free throws. This three-year deal takes Jones, 25, through his prime years. Jones has provided quality minutes as a starter with the Spurs, including 65 games in 2022-23. Still, this deal pays him much more like the backup he will likely be -- and not even at the top of the market, which is north of $10 million annually. One note to watch is how the Bulls handle the structure of this contract. Barring a max deal for restricted free agent Josh Giddey , Chicago isn't close to the luxury tax this season and has cap space aspirations next summer. It might be best for the Bulls to start Jones' contract high (around $8.2 million) and have it descend for 2026-27 to maximize their room, then go up again in 2027-28. New York Knicks plan to sign guard Jordan Clarkson Grade: B- After agreeing to a buyout with the Utah Jazz , Clarkson will reportedly sign with the Knicks once he clears waivers. It has been a while since Clarkson has been on a contending team. He has stuck around as a veteran presence as the Jazz began rebuilding over the past three seasons. Even when Clarkson won the Sixth Man award in 2020-21, he was never an efficient scorer. He has continued to score with a true shooting percentage slightly lower than league average, and it will be interesting to see whether that improves playing alongside better creators in New York. But Clarkson is not a good shooter on the kinds of spot-up opportunities he's likely to get with the Knicks. Over the past three seasons, Clarkson has made 34% of catch-and-shoot 3s, according to GeniusIQ tracking, putting him in the 13th percentile among players with at least 250 attempts in that span. But the price is right. After the buyout, New York will surely pay Clarkson a small fraction of the $14.3 million he was set to make in Utah. Memphis Grizzlies agreed to a reported three-year, $28 million contract with guard Ty Jerome Grade: A- I had Jerome at the top of the tier of low-end starters and quality reserves available in free agency this summer , ranking him 15th overall. Jerome was a finalist for Sixth Man of the Year with the Cleveland Cavaliers , finishing third in the voting after averaging a career-high 12.5 points per game while shooting 52% from the field and 44% on 3s. For the Grizzlies to get him using their room midlevel exception is a coup. Admittedly, some of the luster came off Jerome's campaign during an ugly series against the Indiana Pacers . He shot a combined 2-for-22 in Games 2 and 3 as the Pacers upset the Cavaliers, while also becoming a target for Indiana on defense. Still, Jerome making less than $10 million per year is an overcorrection. Jerome's market was hurt in part by Cleveland's tax situation. Already over the second luxury-tax apron entering free agency, the Cavaliers couldn't bring back both Jerome and Sam Merrill without paying an exorbitant tax bill. Cleveland ended up with Merrill, who will make slightly less annually on a four-year deal. The Grizzlies need depth at point guard because of the time Ja Morant tends to miss, and with Cole Anthony reportedly headed elsewhere to create cap space, Jerome and Scotty Pippen Jr. give Memphis plenty of cover. Jerome also can play shooting guard, where the Grizzlies traded starter Desmond Bane in a deal that returned forward Kentavious Caldwell-Pope . Deep benches have been a hallmark of the Grizzlies in recent years. Adding Jerome should help ensure that continues. New Orleans Pelicans agreed to a reported two-year, $16 million contract with center Kevon Looney Grade: D Though it's early in the New Orleans Pelicans tenure of executive vice president of basketball operations Joe Dumars and senior vice president of basketball operations Troy Weaver, familiar patterns from their separate stints with the Detroit Pistons are emerging. In particular, like the Pistons under Weaver, the Pelicans have stockpiled centers without regard to maximizing value. Days after giving up a valuable first-round pick (the better of those from New Orleans and the Milwaukee Bucks next year) to move up to the No. 13 spot and draft Maryland center Derik Queen , the Pelicans made Looney their marquee addition of free agency. It's undoubtedly true that center was a weakness for New Orleans, which utilized rookies Yves Missi and Karlo Matkovic at the position most of this past season. Only the Phoenix Suns ' center rotation rated worse by my wins above replacement player (WARP) metric. However, Missi and Matkovic showed progress, and at the respective ages of 21 and 24, they figure to improve. Now, the Pelicans have spent much of their limited resources addressing center without finding a clear upgrade. Looney is a reliable veteran with championship experience, but he averaged just 15 minutes per game last season for the Golden State Warriors . Looney made more sense as a minimum signing than for a substantial portion of the non-taxpayer midlevel exception. He also is a non-shooter, making Looney a difficult fit next to Zion Williamson in the frontcourt. Dipping into the non-tax midlevel means New Orleans is now hard-capped at the lower luxury tax apron. It was unlikely the Pelicans would push into the tax anyway, having never before paid it, but that leaves them with just $5 million in wiggle room to fill a remaining roster spot and make moves during the season. For the right addition, that restriction would have made sense. I don't think Looney was the correct target for New Orleans. Orlando Magic agreed to a reported one-year, $7 million contract with guard Tyus Jones Grade: B+ After upgrading at shooting guard by dealing four first-round picks for Desmond Bane , the Magic addressed their point guard spot too, signing the veteran Jones to a one-year deal. Jones projects as part of Orlando's second unit alongside 2023 lottery pick Anthony Black while playing a similar role to the one Cory Joseph played last season. Compared with Joseph, who ended up starting all five Magic playoff games after starter Jalen Suggs was injured, Jones is more of an offensive threat. Granted, that bar is set low. Joseph had a 13% usage rate and averaged just 4.2 assists per 36 minutes as something of a caretaker point guard for Orlando, which relied on forwards Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner for playmaking. Jones brings better 3-point shooting (38% career) and shot creation, meaning the Magic will be in better hands if Suggs again misses time. Jones started 124 games over the past two seasons, though he probably is better suited for a high-end backup role. Having sacrificed money in favor of a starting job on a one-year, minimum deal with the Phoenix Suns last summer, Jones is getting paid more this time around -- nearly double the veterans minimum. Paying him $7 million using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception will take Orlando into the luxury tax, though the Magic still have enough room under the lower tax apron (about $7.5 million) to use more of the exception to fill out the roster if needed. Houston Rockets agreed to a reported four-year, $53 million contract with forward Dorian Finney-Smith Grade: A The Rockets adding one of the best free agents to change teams after dealing for Kevin Durant to begin the offseason reminds me of summer 2017. That year, Houston added Chris Paul via opt-in and trade and structured the deal to have the non-taxpayer midlevel exception available to sign P.J. Tucker -- like Finney-Smith, an experienced 3-and-D role player. Tucker ended up starting as the Rockets won 65 games and took the defending champion Golden State Warriors to seven games in the conference finals. Finney-Smith helps Houston fill the void left by trading defensive stopper Dillon Brooks to the Phoenix Suns in the Durant deal. As compared to Brooks, whose three most frequent half-court matchups defensively included a center ( Victor Wembanyama ) and a point guard ( Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ) according to GeniusIQ tracking, Finney-Smith isn't quite as versatile. At this stage of his career, having Finney-Smith guard forwards is probably preferable to putting him on quicker guards. The Rockets can supplement Finney-Smith with All-Defensive first-team pick Amen Thompson , who proved to be one of the NBA's best point-of-attack defenders last season. Offensively, Finney-Smith fits better alongside Durant than Brooks would have in a different construction of the trade. With shot creation at four positions in the starting five (Durant, Thompson, All-Star center Alperen Sengun and point guard Fred VanVleet ), Houston primarily needs floor spacing from the fifth spot in the lineup. Finney-Smith, a 38% 3-point shooter over the past six seasons who hit 41% beyond the arc last season, provides more of that than Brooks. Although Brooks shot a career-high 40% on 3s in 2024-25, he's at 35.5% for his career. There is some risk here that a four-year contract for Finney-Smith becomes a negative value by the end. That didn't prove the case with Tucker, who ended up helping the Milwaukee Bucks to the 2021 title in the final season of his four-year deal. Still, locking in more guaranteed money helps explain why Finney-Smith declined a 2025-26 player option for $15.4 million that would have paid more than his new average salary. On the plus side, the Rockets getting Finney-Smith for less than the entire value of the non-taxpayer midlevel exception could make it easier for them to avoid paying the luxury tax this season. If Finney-Smith's contract features 5% raises, Houston should end up about $3 million over the tax line, meaning moving Cam Whitmore or multiple minimum contracts midseason could allow the Rockets to dodge the tax. Whether Houston pays the tax is trivial this year but could have important implications down the road in terms of starting the clock on the repeater tax. For now, adding Finney-Smith gives the Rockets a rock-solid top seven that also includes forwards Jabari Smith Jr . (who struck a five-year rookie extension on Sunday) and Tari Eason . Houston supplements that group with center Steven Adams , a key contributor in double-big lineups in the playoffs and recent first-round picks Whitmore and Reed Sheppard . The Rockets also intend to re-sign their own free agents in Jeff Green , Aaron Holiday and Jae'Sean Tate , per ESPN's Shams Charania. All of that means Houston appears to have pulled off the rare feat of upgrading star talent with Durant while not sacrificing any depth. The Rockets are ideally suited to handle any time Durant will likely miss during the regular season and still rack up wins. So long as the Oklahoma City Thunder are healthy, the defending champs are rightfully the favorites to win it all again. As in 2018, however, I think Houston is the biggest threat to a repeat title for the Thunder. Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a reported two-year, $12 million contract with forward Jake LaRavia Grade: B+ I like LaRavia as a target for the Lakers, with the important caveat that they still must figure out who starts at center. A first-round pick by the Memphis Grizzlies in 2022, he saw the team decline his rookie contract option for 2025-26 before the start of last season. Subsequently, LaRavia enjoyed the best season of his career, shooting 42% on 3-pointers and boosting his true shooting percentage from .538 his first two years to .591. Although the Grizzlies traded LaRavia to the Sacramento Kings at the deadline, the declined option continued to restrict the Kings' ability to re-sign him. Sacramento was able to offer a maximum of $5.6 million, the value of that option, to LaRavia this season. The Lakers more or less matched that salary on a two-year deal. For the Lakers, the best part of adding LaRavia is his age. At 23, he is still coming into his own as a contributor; and if this is a straight two-year deal, the Lakers would be able to re-sign him using early Bird rights in the summer of 2027, when he'll be 25. Based on LaRavia's age and production, my SCHOENE projection system has him forecast just outside the top 20 free agents. If that's remotely accurate, $6 million per year should be a bargain. Because LaRavia's contract is too big for the biannual exception, it likely will have to come out of the Lakers' $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. That leaves the Lakers with about $8 million to spend, most likely on a center. Splitting the midlevel would help the Lakers' depth more than committing it all to a single player, which would leave them with the same number of reliable rotation players after seeing Dorian Finney-Smith strike an agreement with the Houston Rockets earlier Monday. Dallas Mavericks agreed to a reported two-year, $13 million contract with guard D'Angelo Russell Grade: B+ From a value standpoint, it's hard to argue this move. Russell made an average of $18 million over the past two seasons and was on a max deal before that. Russell actually will make less in 2025-26 on this contract, which utilizes the taxpayer midlevel exception, than he did in the last year of his rookie deal. Of course, Russell's salary trending the wrong direction also reflects the difficulty of finding the right fit for his skill set. Russell is a high-volume shot creator (24% usage last season) who only scored with high efficiency during two seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers . Russell isn't effective playing primarily off the ball and no longer fits on a rebuilding team at age 29. All of that made Dallas an ideal destination. The Mavericks sputtered in the play-in tournament in part because they lacked an initiator with Kyrie Irving sidelined after a left ACL tear that should keep him out much of the 2025-26 campaign. Dallas started lineups with no true point guard down the stretch, relying on forward Naji Marshall to bring up the ball. The Mavericks certainly weren't going to do better in terms of pedigree than Russell, armed only with their taxpayer midlevel. (To even utilize that, Dallas had to agree to a multiyear deal with Irving that pays him less than a player option would have for 2025-26.) If the Mavericks catch Russell on one of the hot stretches he enjoyed with the Lakers, this could prove an enormous bargain. At the same time, there's always an expiration date with Russell. His limitations were exposed during two playoff runs with the Lakers, as Russell shot just 31% on 3s and was targeted defensively. The ideal scenario for Dallas is probably Russell carrying the team through the regular season before Irving returns in time for a playoff run. If Russell is able to rebuild his value, he'll likely decline a 2026-27 player option in favor of a stronger market in free agency while the Mavs move forward with Irving. So, there's a chance this is a mutually beneficial short-term marriage. LA Clippers agreed to re-sign forward Nicolas Batum to a reported two-year, $11.5 million deal Grade: A Both sides got a little something out of Batum declining his $4.9 million player option in favor of re-signing with the Clippers. Batum gets a slight raise this season, the 20% maximum the Clippers could offer using non-Bird rights without having to dip into their non-taxpayer midlevel exception. Meanwhile, the Clippers get a team option on Batum for 2026-27 that will give them some flexibility with how to handle next summer. The Clippers could have cap space if James Harden declines his 2026-27 player option. Alternatively, if the Clippers stay over the cap, they could exercise Batum's salary and use him as matching salary in a trade. Most likely, that would happen only if Batum decided to retire and got a golden parachute from the Clippers. He'll turn 37 in December but remains a key reserve who averaged 24.6 MPG for the Clippers in their seven-game first-round series against the Denver Nuggets . Batum's experience, shooting ability and defensive versatility will be valuable right up to when he calls it a career. The Clippers now have all eight players who saw at least 50 minutes of action against Denver under contract and will be filling in around them, presumably with another ball handler or a backup center. LA Clippers agreed to re-sign guard James Harden to a reported two-year, $81.5 million contract Grade: B- The Clippers and Harden struck a creative contract, but I'm surprised he commanded a raise in this free agent market, even coming off an All-NBA season. The 2025-26 player option on the contract Harden signed as an unrestricted free agent last summer was scheduled to pay him $36.3 million. Only the Brooklyn Nets have the cap space to make Harden that kind of offer without a sign-and-trade deal, and a return to Brooklyn seemed implausible for any number of reasons. Not only will Harden instead make a minimum of $39 million this season (assuming maximum 8% raises), but he also gets the benefit of an unorthodox player option for 2026-27. Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the player option is partially guaranteed, making the second season something of a mutual option. To make that legal, Harden's 2025-26 salary must be guaranteed for the same percentage. Presumably, that salary will fully guarantee days or weeks after the contract is signed, similar to the deal J.R. Smith signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers in September 2015. The player option also gives Harden the right to approve any trade this season. As with Smith, who declined his option after the Cavaliers won the 2016 title, the partial guarantee probably won't ultimately matter. Assuming Harden stays healthy and plays well during his age-36 season, either the Clippers will guarantee his 2026-27 salary or Harden will decline the player option and head into free agency next summer when more teams have cap space. A serious injury seems to be the only way Harden would exercise the option and be waived next summer. The upside is that giving Harden a raise doesn't really take anything off the table for the Clippers. With 12 players under contract, including Drew Eubanks and Jordan Miller on non-guaranteed deals, the Clippers are about $22 million below the lower luxury tax apron. That allowed them to re-sign forward Nicolas Batum after he declined a $4.9 million player option and still use their $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. The Clippers should be able to add another contributor using the midlevel exception, perhaps either another ball handler or a more experienced backup center after the team drafted Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Houston Rockets agreed to a reported five-year, $122 million extension with forward Jabari Smith Jr . Grade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail) Smith is the first 2022 first-round pick to agree on a rookie contract extension. As ESPN's Bobby Marks noted , that's unusual because max extensions like we expect to see for Orlando Magic forward Paolo Banchero and the Oklahoma City Thunder 's duo of Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams (barring discounts) are typically the quickest extensions to get done. Per Marks, Isaiah Stewart 's deal with the Detroit Pistons on July 11, 2023 -- five days after the conclusion of the negotiating moratorium period -- was the earliest non-max rookie extension in recent memory . The Rockets and Smith got a deal done before the moratorium period has even begun. For Smith, this locks in life-changing money ahead of a season where his role is uncertain. A starter for the first 188 games he played for Houston, Smith lost his job to Amen Thompson while he was sidelined for over a month by a broken bone in his right hand. Even in 18 games as a reserve last season, Smith averaged 28 minutes per game. (He actually scored more off the bench by virtue of stronger efficiency.) With the Rockets' deal for Kevin Durant and their ability to utilize the non-taxpayer midlevel exception, it's unclear what role Smith might play this season. He could fill the open spot in the starting lineup or get squeezed if Houston adds another forward in free agency. Either way, at 22, Smith is an important part of the Rockets' post-Durant future. We've yet to see Smith prove to be the kind of shot creator in the NBA that he was during the single season at Auburn which made him the No. 3 pick by Houston. In fact, his usage rate has dropped all three seasons to a career-low 16%. But Smith's combination of ability to space the floor (36% from 3-point range on almost six attempts per 36 minutes) and defensive versatility at 6-foot-11 gives him a floor of key rotation player on a contender. The upside scenario is Smith continues his development and makes this contract a bargain for the Rockets. Smith is younger than more than a third of the players drafted this week, including first-round picks Walter Clayton Jr ., Nique Clifford and Yanic Konan Niederhauser . This extension pays Smith less annually than Trey Murphy, who signed the most comparable extension last year (four years, $112 million). The way Houston negotiated hard on Alperen Sengun 's extension in particular has facilitated strengthening a contending core this season. The Rockets should have their non-taxpayer midlevel exception available to add to this group after dealing two starters ( Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green ) for Durant. This extension didn't take nearly as long as ones for Green and Sengun, which were signed just before the deadline. Still, it could be similarly beneficial for Houston. Minnesota Timberwolves agreed to re-sign forward Julius Randle to a reported three-year, $100 million contract Grade: B Essentially, this contract functions as a two-year, $69 million extension for Randle on top of his $31 million player option for 2025-26. In fact, based on maximum possible 8% raises, Randle's cap hit may come out almost identical to that figure. Getting Randle signed for three years gives Minnesota cost certainty about this core. The Timberwolves project right around the 2026-27 luxury-tax line without starting point guard Mike Conley Jr. under contract and will have more breathing room by 2027-28, when Donte DiVincenzo 's contract expires and the cap figures to increase faster than year-to-year raises. For now, Minnesota is probably just about done with its 2025-26 roster, which surely won't include hotly coveted unrestricted free agent Nickeil Alexander-Walker . After getting new contracts done with their other two key free agents, Randle and Naz Reid , Minnesota has just enough room to fill out the roster with minimum contracts -- possibly team options for forward Josh Minott and center Luka Garza -- and stay below the second apron. Because the Timberwolves will be closer to the tax line with Rudy Gobert 's salary decreasing in the first year of an extension, their tax bill will be more modest this season. Minnesota figures to start the season paying $20-30 million in taxes, with the ability to reduce that by trading away players at the end of the roster midseason. Compared to the Reid contract, I like the value better here for the Timberwolves. Randle is a two-time All-Star who played at that level over the first two rounds of the playoffs before a disappointing series against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the conference finals. Randle didn't likely have a market at this level in free agency this summer but could have done better a year from now when many more teams will have cap space. Making this a new contract rather than an extension allows the two sides to wipe out the incentives in Randle's current contract, meaning he's assured his full cap hit and unlikely incentives no longer affect Minnesota with regard to the luxury-tax apron. Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James exercises $52.6 million player option Grade: N/A At surface level, the explanation from ESPN's Shams Charania that James is exercising his 2025-26 player option while simultaneously contemplating his future with the Lakers is difficult to understand. If James might want to play elsewhere, why not become a free agent? Because this year's market is largely devoid of cap space, the rebuilding Brooklyn Nets are the only team that could offer James anything approaching his $54.1 million max salary as a free agent. If James is somehow to change teams this summer, it will almost certainly be by trade. A sign-and-trade would be possible if James were to decline his option, but that possibility is complicated by the fact that a team receiving a player via sign-and-trade is automatically hard-capped at the lower luxury-tax apron, limiting its moves to build out the roster. An opt-in and trade isn't subject to the same restrictions. For example, hypothetically the Golden State Warriors could now trade Jimmy Butler III (starting a max extension) to the Lakers for James and Bronny James and neither team would face a hard cap of any kind, allowing the Warriors to re-sign restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga . Setting James' cap number does clarify the Lakers' options in free agency. Essentially, the team will be choosing between re-signing forward Dorian Finney-Smith (who plans to decline a $15.4 million player option in favor of a longer contract, per Charania) and using the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception, presumably on a starting center. Going the latter route would hard-cap the Lakers at the lower apron and allow them to safely fill out the roster with minimum contracts while keeping a little wiggle room for in-season trades. Milwaukee Bucks agreed to re-sign forward/center Bobby Portis to a reported three-year, $44 million contract Grade: C- Portis had to decide Sunday on a $13.4 million player option for 2025-26. Instead, he'll sign a new contract that should pay him a similar amount this season with two additional years at $30-plus million. I'm surprised the market was that high on Portis, who was a finalist for the Sixth Man award in both 2022-23 and 2023-24 but has never rated that well by advanced stats. Portis was not nearly as efficient a scorer last season, when his accuracy on both 2s (51%) and 3s (36.5%) was his lowest since signing with Milwaukee in 2020. Additionally, Portis missed nearly the entire second half due to a 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy. To Portis' credit, he became coach Doc Rivers' most trusted option at center by the end of the Bucks' first-round loss to the Indiana Pacers . Portis played 44 minutes in Game 5, which went to overtime, and had a double-double of 14 points (albeit on 6-of-18 shooting) and 10 rebounds. With Brook Lopez an unrestricted free agent, Portis could be Milwaukee's starting center next year. Though Portis' contract would be on the cheap side for a veteran starter, I suspect playing that role would expose him defensively. Opponents shot 69% on attempts inside 5 feet with Portis as a primary defender, per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats , putting him in the bottom 25 among all players who defended at least three such shots per game. By contrast, opponents hit just 59% of those attempts against Lopez. I'm also skeptical of how well Portis will hold his value over the life of this contract. He turned 30 in February and will be 33 by the final season of the deal, another player option. The quickness that has been a strength for Portis when defended by centers might not remain an advantage much longer. Every dollar counts for the Bucks, who are $27.5 million below the first luxury tax apron with nine players under contract, including non-guaranteed salaries for AJ Green , Andre Jackson Jr . and Chris Livingston . If Milwaukee wants to use its non-taxpayer midlevel exception to re-sign unrestricted free agents Kevin Porter Jr . and/or Gary Trent Jr ., it will have a difficult time re-signing Lopez due to the resulting hard cap. If Portis wanted to exercise his player option, I would have welcomed him back and considered an extension down the road. Failing that, I probably would have preferred to let Portis test the market and focus on re-signing Lopez. Oklahoma City Thunder agree to re-sign center Jaylin Williams to a reported three-year, $24 million contract Grade: B+ This deal is the latest example of the Thunder trying to manage their contracts to spend as much money now to have more flexibility down the road when extensions kick in for starters Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams . Those deals are the remaining business for the defending champs, whose roster is full. Because Oklahoma City held a $2.2 million team option for Jaylin Williams' 2025-26 salary, this essentially functions as a two-year extension for $22 million. By declining the team option and starting the contract now, the Thunder can maximize the amount of the total salary Williams gets this season. Starting the deal at its highest point and declining from there would leave Oklahoma City just under the luxury-tax threshold after Saturday's trade sending 2024 first-round pick Dillon Jones to the Washington Wizards to clear a roster spot and save money. That presumes the Thunder pick up a $3 million team option on guard Ajay Mitchell , who is in a different situation because he will still be a restricted free agent next summer. Williams would have been unrestricted. Although Williams wasn't part of the Thunder's rotation during the last two rounds of the playoffs, he has become a reliable option at center who took on an important role with starters Isaiah Hartenstein and Holmgren unavailable during much of the regular season. Williams posted three triple-doubles in nine starts, averaging 10.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.9 assists. He could become a rotation fixture down the road if Oklahoma City has to move on from Hartenstein, whose $28.5 million 2026-27 salary is a team option, for financial reasons. Agreed to re-sign guard Davion Mitchell to a reported two-year, $24 million deal Grade: B By virtue of reaching 2,000 minutes played last season and achieving \"starter criteria,\" Mitchell was in a strong negotiating position as a restricted free agent. Because of starter criteria, Mitchell's qualifying offer was $9.4 million -- second highest among restricted free agents, after Josh Giddey of the Chicago Bulls . Even if no market developed for Mitchell, playing 2025-26 for the qualifying offer and becoming an unrestricted free agent next summer was a legitimate possibility. Instead, the two sides agreed on a deal that guarantees Mitchell more money but keeps him under contract for two years, which also means he can be included in a trade without having to consent. Mitchell could still be a bargain if he keeps shooting like he did after joining the Heat at the trade deadline. Previously a 34% career 3-point shooter, Mitchell shot 45% from deep with Miami and 7-of-14 in the playoffs, earning a starting role and averaging 31.6 minutes per game after the trade. Nicknamed \"Off Night\" for his effect on opposing guards, Mitchell has always been an elite point-of-attack defender, but his lack of offense limited him to a reserve role during three seasons with the Sacramento Kings , who traded him to reduce salary this time a year ago. I'm hesitant to read too much into a sample of around 100 3-point attempts, but we've seen the Heat work wonders with non-shooters in the past. This deal gives Miami a couple more years to figure out whether Mitchell's progress is legit and whether he can be a starting guard going forward. With Mitchell re-signed, the Heat are nearing the lower luxury-tax apron but still have the ability to go under the tax line by waiving forward Duncan Robinson . Presuming Robinson doesn't exercise an early termination option to test free agency, he'll be under contract for $19.9 million. However, just $9.9 million of Robinson's 2026-27 salary is guaranteed. Agreed to re-sign guard Sam Merrill to a reported four-year, $38 million contract Grade: B After totaling just 350 minutes over his first three NBA seasons played with three different teams, Merrill has become an important fixture on Cleveland's outstanding bench units of the past two seasons. Always a premier shooter, Merrill has hit 39% of his career 3-point attempts and pushed his volume with the Cavaliers: 11.9 attempts per 36 minutes in 2023-24 and 9.5 last season. A better defender than he appears based on physical tools, Merrill maintained a key spot in the rotation with Darius Garland sidelined to start Cleveland's second-round playoff loss to the Indiana Pacers -- up until a neck strain sidelined him for the deciding Game 5. Previously on a minimum contract, Merrill had earned a big raise. Given the Cavaliers were $10 million over the second luxury tax apron after Saturday's deal for Lonzo Ball with just 10 players under NBA contract, that surely meant choosing between Merrill and fellow bargain reserve Ty Jerome . In all likelihood, Merrill's contract will come in lower than Jerome's. This deal starts around $8.5 million with maximum 8% raises, putting it around the value of the room midlevel exception and far less than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception that could be Jerome's market. Going out four years with Merrill could have some risk. Because he was drafted at age 24 after serving a Latter-day Saints mission prior to his career at Utah State, Merrill recently turned 29 and this deal takes him well into his 30s. Merrill's shooting ability is unlikely to wane but his defense might become an issue at some point. With Cleveland's second-apron limitations, replacing Merrill would have been difficult, and the team can plan for a two-year window of big spending before retrenching when several contracts expire after the 2026-27 campaign. In that context, signing Merrill for a smaller starting salary but a larger total amount probably made sense for the Cavaliers. Agreed to a reported five-year, $125 million contract with forward/center Naz Reid Grade: C- In what looked like a difficult market for free agents, Reid found leverage to get an incredibly favorable contract. The Timberwolves now face a challenge to also re-sign starting forward Julius Randle (who, like Reid, holds a player option for 2025-26) and reserve guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker . Minnesota must make some choices about who to value, which started with paying Reid like a starting-caliber player over the span of his new contract. That's interesting because only one other team (the Brooklyn Nets ) could make a similar offer to Reid, and because there's not a clear path to him becoming a starter in the short term if the Timberwolves bring back Randle. Unless the Nets were interested, Reid's market would presumably have been at the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. That would have carried a max value of $60.6 million over four years, far less than Minnesota offered. Reid also had the option of exercising his $15 million player option for 2025-26 and taking his chances next summer, which should have been viewed as a good outcome by the Timberwolves. Assuming max 8% raises, Reid's salary for next season will bump up to $21.6 million. That leaves Minnesota about $33 million shy of the second luxury tax apron, including team options for forward Josh Minott and center Luka Garza . That could be enough to bring back Randle, whose 2025-26 option would carry a $31 million cap hit. Retaining Randle and Alexander-Walker, who should have a market near or at the non-tax midlevel, now seems impossible, barring a trade. I understand the Timberwolves prioritizing the two big men after drafting guards Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr . in last year's first round. Minnesota also has 2023 second-round pick Jaylen Clark , who flashed at the defensive end in his rookie season after missing all of 2023-24 due to injury. Additionally, the Timberwolves are paying Reid through his prime years. He'll turn 26 in August and will be 30 at the end of this five-year contract. Still, I'm not convinced Reid is a starting-caliber player despite winning the Sixth Man award in 2023-24. A bench role suits Reid because of his defensive limitations, which were exposed by playing center more last season after Minnesota traded Karl-Anthony Towns . Lineups with Reid at center allowed a 116.3 defensive rating last season, per Cleaning the Glass , as compared to 103.0 when he played power forward. That's worth keeping in mind if you're projecting Reid as Rudy Gobert 's eventual replacement at center. The advent of the second apron, plus steeper penalties for teams with large luxury tax bills, means overpaying key contributors is more costly than ever. Although Reid has been an indispensable part of the Timberwolves teams that have reached the past two conference finals, paying him like a starter is going to force them to sacrifice down the line. Given the market, I think Minnesota should have done better with this contract. Agreed to a reported two-year, $50 million contract with guard Fred VanVleet Grade: A This deal, which will replace a $44.9 million team option the Rockets held for VanVleet in 2025-26, is some combination of Houston using its leverage well and/or being willing to spend even bigger in the future. It's certainly true that VanVleet would have had a tough time beating this offer on the open market. Only the Brooklyn Nets could even legally do so using cap space, meaning the Rockets' participation in a sign-and-trade would have been necessary for VanVleet to get more than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception to play for a contender as an unrestricted free agent. Still, the same will be true for virtually any free agent of note, and it's unlikely other teams will get this kind of bargain. Consider that VanVleet will make less next season than Kyrie Irving , who will start the year rehabbing an ACL tear. Yes, Irving had the leverage of a player option for 2025-26 on his contract, but he still added more new money ($76 million over the two years beyond 2025-26) than VanVleet. It's possible VanVleet could make up the difference now that he holds a player option for 2026-27. Houston is currently hard-capped at the second luxury-tax apron by virtue of aggregating salaries in the Kevin Durant trade. That restriction may not exist a year from now, which would allow the Rockets to potentially re-sign VanVleet to a bigger, longer deal in a summer where other teams will have ample cap space to pursue him. For the time being, getting VanVleet around $20 million less than his option sets Houston up to have access to its non-taxpayer midlevel exception. In a market where only the Nets will likely have more to offer, that makes the Rockets a player for a big-time free agent to complement Durant and their young core. Nickeil Alexander-Walker is the most obvious Houston target who would fit into a playoff rotation on the perimeter, having played that role for the Minnesota Timberwolves in back-to-back conference finals runs. Gary Trent Jr .'s shooting is another fit, while Ty Jerome would be a good value but might be duplicative of what the Rockets hope 2024 No. 3 pick Reed Sheppard will become. Wherever Houston lands, the ability to access the full midlevel should help Houston replace the slight depth lost in the Durant trade and strengthen the Rockets as championship contenders. Agreed to a reported three-year, $119 million extension with guard Kyrie Irving Grade: B+ Irving had until the end of the day Tuesday to decide on a $43 million player option for 2025-26. Instead of exercising it, he declined it and will sign this extension, effectively adding two years and $76 million to his contract. The Mavericks had a degree of leverage because the Brooklyn Nets ' trade on Tuesday potentially means no other team could offer Irving as much money in free agency. (In practice, the rebuilding Nets bringing Irving back three years after dealing him to Dallas might be politely termed a long shot.) At the same time, Irving could have picked up his option and targeted free agency next year, when it's possible he could have gotten a contract worth more annually -- and certainly a longer one. This seems like a fair compromise. Reducing Irving's starting salary to around $37 million has important implications for the Mavericks this summer. That leaves them about $7 million from the second luxury-tax apron with 13 players under contract, not counting a team option for backup point guard Brandon Williams . Had Irving picked up his option, Dallas would likely have been limited to offering minimum contracts, barring a money-saving trade. Now, the Mavericks could have access to the taxpayer midlevel to sign a ball handler as a free agent and fill the void left by Irving, who will be out much of 2025-26 after suffering an ACL tear in March. Agreed to a reported three-year extension with center Daniel Gafford Grade: Pass (extensions for non-free agents graded on a pass/fail basis) The most interesting element of this extension is the timing. Conventional wisdom had it that Gafford could be a trade candidate this summer, given the Mavericks' crowded depth chart at center, where younger Dereck Lively II is the team's starter of the future and starting power forward Anthony Davis is also capable of -- and perhaps best suited for -- playing the 5. There's little question that Gafford merits a raise coming off the best season of his NBA career. Having excelled defensively in a platoon with Lively as Dallas reached the 2024 NBA Finals, Gafford got a chance to play extended minutes between when Lively went down with a stress fracture in his right ankle in January and his own knee sprain in February. During 11 full games in that span, Gafford averaged 15.0 PPG on 67% shooting, 10.3 RPG and 3.6 BPG, the last of which would have threatened Victor Wembanyama (3.8 BPG) for tops in the NBA. Typically just a finisher on offense, Gafford even created in the post with the team battling multiple injuries. His 52 post-ups last season was a career high, per GeniusIQ tracking, although Gafford's efficiency on those plays wasn't especially strong. NBA free agency is in full swing, and ESPN experts are breaking down the biggest signings and trades. • New free agent rankings: Pelton's top 10 • Latest news and buzz | Details for every trade • Pelton's grades: Free agent deals | Trades • NBA insiders: Rumblings across the league • Marks: How 30 teams ace the offseason • Salary cap space, best FA fits for every team Besides the limitations on Gafford's role with the Mavericks, a trade now also makes sense because this could be the peak of his performance. Gafford will be 27 in October, and while his size won't fade, Gafford might not remain such a strong above-the-rim threat as he nears his 30s. Based on those factors, it was important for Dallas to craft an extension with a maximum 20% raise in 2026-27 (a starting salary of $17.3 million) and 5% annual raises that fits restrictions on extend-and-trade deals. By virtue of apparently staying within that, the Mavericks can trade Gafford as soon as he signs the extension -- or, hypothetically, even before then. Having Gafford under contract an additional three seasons shouldn't hurt his trade value at all. This extension pays him barely more than the expected 2026-27 non-taxpayer midlevel exception of $15.5 million, and Gafford has easily outpaced that in terms of value thus far. From his perspective, locking in his deal a year ahead of time does take injury risk off the table. So I'd consider this move a win-win. The next question is which teams could be in the market for Gafford. He's an obvious fit for the Los Angeles Lakers , having demonstrated his comfort running pick-and-rolls with Luka Doncic , but that idea seems triggering for already aggrieved Dallas fans. Gafford would be a sensible target for the guard-heavy Phoenix Suns , though finding workable matching salary is a challenge unless the Suns get under the second apron. If the New Orleans Pelicans aren't convinced Yves Missi is a starting-caliber center at this stage of his development, Gafford would be a huge offensive upgrade. I'd also consider a return to Gafford's original team, the Chicago Bulls , and the San Antonio Spurs as wild-card possibilities. Of course, the Mavericks may just hold on to Gafford. After all, they spent much of the second half of last season with none of their three starting-caliber centers healthy, so there is value in having depth at the position. And it would be challenging for another would-be contender to offer the perimeter help Dallas seeks, meaning a Gafford trade would most likely need to involve at least three teams. Agreed to a reported three-year, $39 million contract with Steven Adams Grade: B We're off and running on the 2025 offseason with games still to play in the NBA Finals. Teams aren't allowed to negotiate new contracts with their own free agents until the day after the Finals end, but they can strike extensions with eligible players in the last year of their contracts at any point up to June 30. Acquired by the Rockets at the 2024 trade deadline while still recovering from season-ending PCL surgery, Adams initially served as a veteran mentor on a young team and a backup to All-Star center Alperen Sengun . His role expanded considerably in the playoffs, when lineups featuring both Adams and Sengun unexpectedly became key to Houston taking the Golden State Warriors the distance after falling behind 3-1 in the series. Whether alongside Sengun or as the team's lone center, Adams reached a level in the playoffs that we haven't seen since early in his career. Adams blocked 1.9 shots per 36 minutes, surpassing his best regular-season mark (1.7). And his 60% shooting was way up from 55% during the 2024-25 regular season. My wins above replacement player metric rated Adams the team's fourth-most valuable player in the series, ahead of starters Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green .

For more information, click here . Given that the size and strength that make Adams a dominant offensive rebounder aren't going anywhere, the kind of agility we saw against the Warriors will make him a valuable player for the Rockets as long as he stays healthy. Before the PCL injury that cost him the 2023 playoffs and all of 2023-24, Adams had been remarkably durable, playing 76 of 82 games in 2021-22. And Houston will surely be careful with Adams' workload. Although Adams was cleared to play both ends of back-to-back games midway through last season, the Rockets continued to give him one of the games off because of how he recovers after playing the night before. Bringing back Adams on a contract in the $13 million range -- a little less than the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel that is the most other teams could have realistically offered -- does push Houston into the luxury tax if the team exercises Fred VanVleet 's $44.9 million team option. And even if the Rockets waive two players with non-guaranteed deals ( Jock Landale , at $8 million, and Nate Williams at the minimum), they'd edge over the lower luxury tax apron by filling out the roster in that scenario. Alternatively, Houston could decline the option and try to bring back VanVleet at a smaller starting salary on a longer-term deal that would guarantee him more money at age 31. That decision could be influenced by what other moves the Rockets have cooking. Their tax situation makes it seem unlikely Houston will add a free agent making more than the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel, but the Rockets could make more substantial moves via trade. Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, Houston has until June 29 to decide on VanVleet's player option. Barring a blockbuster trade, VanVleet will almost certainly be back, meaning Adams' new contract gives the Rockets a chance to return the entire core that claimed the No. 2 seed in the West."}

(0:46) The NBA season begins Tuesday, but that isn't the only thing on the minds of league executives in the coming days. The deadline for rookie extensions (and for veterans signed past this season) is 6 p.m. ET Monday, roughly 24 hours before the Houston Rockets travel to face the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder to tip off the 2025-26 season. Heading into this season, we've already seen several players from the 2022 draft class sign extensions with their teams. Paolo Banchero , Chet Holmgren and Jabari Smith Jr . -- the first, second and third picks in that draft by the Orlando Magic , Thunder and Rockets, respectively -- signed long-term deals with those teams in July. As did Jalen Williams (No. 12 by OKC) this offseason and Nikola Jovic (No. 27 by the Miami Heat ) last month. On Wednesday, the Sacramento Kings and Keegan Murray (No. 4) settled on a five-year, $140 million pact, per ESPN's Shams Charania. Of the 15 players from that class who remain extension eligible between now and Monday, how many will also land long-term deals with their current teams? Keep in mind, 14 out of the 25 players who signed rookie extensions in 2023 and 2024 signed on the last day eligible. And by Monday, teams will also have to reduce their rosters to 15 on standard contracts. With all that in mind, we assessed the market for 10 of the biggest names in the rookie extension pool, laid out the most interesting negotiations left on the board and explained how we think they will each play out Dyson Daniels , Atlanta Hawks Hawks guard Dyson Daniels has been a huge success story for Atlanta. Troy Taormina-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Daniels is a huge success story for Atlanta. He came to the Hawks last summer as part of the trade that sent Dejounte Murray to the New Orleans Pelicans and became the NBA's Most Improved Player last season while leading the league in steals (229, the most in a season by any player since Gary Payton in 1995-96). The Hawks were able to get a deal done at the deadline with Jalen Johnson last year, and it wouldn't be hard to see them find a way to get one done for Daniels. -- Tim Bontemps Why it might not: His agent, Daniel Moldovan, is using the five-year, $150 million extension Jalen Suggs signed last year as the comparison for Daniels, while also assessing Trae Young 's uncertain future in Atlanta. Daniels was named first-team All-Defense, finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and increased his offensive production from 5.8 to 14.1 points. But Young has a $49 million player option next season and has been eligible to sign an extension since mid-June. -- Bobby Marks What I would offer: Five years, $125 million. The contract would remain flat at $25 million per season. Factoring in the new contract for Daniels, and Young's player option, Atlanta would be $26 million below the luxury tax and comfortably beneath both aprons. -- Marks Will it happen?: If last year's negotiations with Johnson are a guide -- where the two sides haggled over it and then got a deal done right before the deadline -- then this one probably will go right up to Monday's deadline. The guess here is something gets done, but landing on a number both sides agree on could be difficult. -- Bontemps Christian Braun and Peyton Watson , Denver Nuggets Why an extension could get done : Braun has become an integral part of Denver's operation, helping the Nuggets win their first NBA title as a rookie and then stepping into the starting lineup last season in Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 's spot at shooting guard. He's the one clear long-term building block the Nuggets have. Watson, meanwhile, is a pogo-stick athlete who also brings an interesting skill set alongside Nikola Jokic , making him appealing for a long-term deal. -- Bontemps Why it might not: The Nuggets shaved nearly $17 million off their cap ledger for next season after they traded Michael Porter Jr . for Cameron Johnson . But Denver is projected to be $24 million below the apron, not including new contracts for Braun and Watson, as they enter the first year of Aaron Gordon 's extension. They could get $10 million in salary relief, but at the cost of waiving Jonas Valanciunas . The veteran's contract is guaranteed if he is on the roster past 11:59 p.m. ET on June 29. -- Marks Breaking News from Shams Charania Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . What I would offer: Let's first address the elephant in the room. Even if the Nuggets waive Valanciunas, Denver is still a second apron team if both Watson and Braun extend, and then the roster is filled out with players on minimum contracts. There is no dancing around that financial hurdle unless there is a trade to clear out money. As for Braun, team executives pointed to the five-year, $150 million extension Suggs signed with Orlando as the number to watch. But two red flags come with that. First, Suggs earned second-team All-Defense in 2024 and was paid because of his impact on the defensive end. Braun, on the other hand, averaged career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks last season and became the first player since Buddy Hield in 2018-19 with at least 400 fast-break points. Second, Orlando at the time had the financial wiggle room to start Suggs at $35 million per season and the flexibility to improve its roster. The Nuggets do not have the same flexibility. A five-year, $126.5 million extension for Braun that starts at $21.8 million would be a solid compromise for both sides. Braun's salary next season ranks in the top 15 of shooting guards. Watson's extension is more difficult to project because of his upside (he just turned 23) and his role coming off the bench. A four-year, $54 million extension would be team-friendly, considering next year's salary is $3 million below the non-tax midlevel exception. -- Marks Will it happen?: Braun's deal feels most likely to happen. He's too important to what Denver is trying to do, and cost certainty on his deal ahead of restricted free agency next summer will be critical. Though Watson is an intriguing player, given how Zeke Nnaji 's extension has aged for the Nuggets, it would be a bit surprising if Denver does a similar thing with Watson now, particularly with how their finances look going forward. -- Bontemps Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren , Detroit Pistons A deal for both Jaden Ivey (23) and Jalen Duren (0) will be difficult to accomplish. Grace Smith/USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Ivey was showing signs of improvement before an unfortunate leg injury cost him the final few months of last season. His skill set could pair nicely with Cade Cunningham in the backcourt moving forward. For Duren, the argument is simple: He's a 21-year-old who averaged a double-double in his first season under J.B. Bickerstaff, and both sides hope he can continue to improve this season and beyond. -- Bontemps Why it might not: How much do the Pistons consider the broken left fibula Ivey suffered on Jan. 1? GM Trajan Langdon said before the start of training camp that there are no restrictions on Ivey, but that does not mean Detroit should take an aggressive stand with his next contract until it can evaluate him during the regular season. Duren's future comes down to not wanting to pay a center the high premium. Since 2020, there have been only two bigs -- Alperen Sengun and Jaren Jackson Jr . -- who have signed a non-max rookie extension starting at $20 million or more. -- Marks What I would offer: The Pistons handed out a five-year, $269 million extension to Cunningham in 2024 but still have financial runway to sign both players to lucrative extensions and flexibility to improve either in free agency or a trade. A five-year, $112.5 million extension for Duren would start at $25.6 million and decline to $19.4 million in the last season. The contract takes into consideration what Duren accomplished in his first three seasons and also his upside. He is one of five players in NBA history with at least 100 career double-doubles before turning 22. The Ivey extension would be four years, $86.5 million, with an up-and-down structure. The first year's salary would start at $23.9 million, then decline to $19.3 million in the last year. Including a prior injury exclusion (exhibit 3) would protect Detroit if Ivey suffers another injury to the same leg. -- Marks Will it happen?: It feels unlikely either of these will get done. There are just too many complicating factors in getting to a fair number for Ivey, making it more likely both sides will let this season play out and revisit next summer. And while Duren is young and showed improvement last season, there are questions about his rim protection long term and making a big bet on him now feels beyond what Detroit will ultimately do. It is also worth noting that this front office didn't draft either of these players. -- Bontemps Tari Eason , Houston Rockets Why an extension could get done: Eason is an analytical darling who has been consistent for the Rockets since being drafted No. 17 in 2022. Though it's likely he again comes off the bench this season, combo forwards with his skill set and ability to disrupt play at both ends are highly valued, and Houston has shown an ability to continually get its young core players locked into good contracts. -- Bontemps Why it might not: The Rockets probably will consider Eason's season-ending surgery on his left leg in the 2023-24 season and the 22 games he sat out last season because of the same leg. He played all 82 games in his rookie season but only a combined 59 in the past two. Eason has started only 16 games and probably will be in that sixth-man role again this season. Houston also signed Jabari Smith to an extension that starts at $23.6 million next season, and is expected to sign Kevin Durant to an extension. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $80 million. The apron era has taught teams to prioritize their own pending free agents and balance future finances. With Amen Thompson eligible to sign an extension next summer, it is hard to justify an average salary of $20 million or more for a player coming off the bench. -- Marks Will it happen?: This feels as if it will get done eventually. With Eason's injury history, locking in some long-term financial security makes sense. Houston has locked up its young players under general manager Rafael Stone, so expect the Rockets to continue to do so. -- Bontemps Bennedict Mathurin , Indiana Pacers Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said over the summer that Bennedict Mathurin, above, was going to be a starter with Tyrese Haliburton out for the season. Trevor Ruszkowski-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said over the summer that Mathurin, the first single-digit draft pick the Pacers have had in a couple of generations, was going to be a starter with Tyrese Haliburton out for the season. For a team that tends to keep its talent in-house, getting a deal done with Mathurin could make sense. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Mathurin's minutes and production should increase this season with Haliburton out. But can Indiana afford to pay the wing starter money when $80 million is already committed to Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell next season? Mathurin came off the bench in 60% of games played in the past three seasons. An extension would also put Indiana over the luxury tax and near the first apron in 2026-27. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $68 million. Mathurin's production over the past three years should warrant an extension that pays an average of $17 million. The wing is one of four players of his draft class to score at least 3,000 points and he averaged 16 points for a second time in his three seasons in 2024-25, while leading all reserves in postseason points. But as we mentioned above, playing time next season and the Pacers' payroll have to be taken into consideration. -- Marks Will it happen?: This one feels unlikely. Indiana, a team that hasn't paid the luxury tax in decades, already has $160 million committed to seven players next season -- leaving the Pacers with about $40 million to fill out the roster below the luxury tax, and without a clear starting center among the players currently under contract. Getting something done that Mathurin would accept now feels too rich for the Pacers within those constraints. -- Bontemps Mark Williams , Phoenix Suns Why an extension could get done: Phoenix has already shown a commitment to Williams by sending out two first-round picks -- the No. 29 pick this past June, plus a 2029 first-rounder -- to get him from the Charlotte Hornets . So, with that investment already in the bag, getting Williams on a long-term contract with the franchise would make some sense. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Williams' health might be the most scrutinized in the NBA. The Lakers traded for Williams in February, only for him to fail his physical. After the trade was rescinded, Williams averaged 28.6 minutes, 15.1 points, 10.7 rebounds and a career high 1.3 blocks. He has never played more than 45 games in any season and has missed 116 games with various injuries (back, left foot and thumb). A likely approach is to evaluate Williams this season and then engage in contracts next summer when he is a restricted free agent. -- Marks What I would offer: A three-year, $51 million extension. The contract would be a flat $17 million per season and include exhibit 3 (prior injury exclusion that protects the Suns if Williams has a foot or back injury). The last year of the contract would be non-guaranteed but would have a minutes clause that partially or fully protects the salary. For example, if Williams plays in 55 games in 2025-26, 2026-27 and 2027-28, the contract would be fully guaranteed. If Williams reaches the criteria in one of the next three seasons, the protection would increase from zero to $5.66 million. -- Marks Will it happen?: It's hard to see it happening, even with the investment in draft capital the Suns put in to get Williams. He's a talented lob catcher, but since he's already dealing with injury issues out of the gate and has played in only 106 games in his career, this seems as if it will be a wait-and-see situation. -- Bontemps Shaedon Sharpe , Portland Trail Blazers Guard Shaedon Sharpe is a 6-foot-6 multifaceted wing who averaged 18.5 points last season. Troy Wayrynen-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Sharpe was general manager Joe Cronin's first draft pick in 2022, and will play this season -- his fourth in the NBA -- at just 22 years old. He's also a 6-foot-6 multifaceted wing who averaged 18.5 points last season. Add that up, and it's easy to see why Portland would want to keep him as part of its program moving forward. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Cap flexibility next offseason. Even after trading for Jrue Holiday and then signing Damian Lillard , Portland has $129 million in salary. The salary cap is projected to be $166 million. But Sharpe has a $25.2 million cap hold as a free agent, meaning Portland is already over the cap. The Blazers would have to let Sharpe walk in free agency to free up room. -- Marks What I would offer: Four years, $105 million. The contract seems rich, but I am betting on Sharpe's upside. In his first two seasons combined, he scored 1,299 points, and scored 1,335 points last season. He became the first Trail Blazer to have seven career 30-point games before turning 22. The contract would start at $29 million and then decline each season, with the last year being $23.5 million. The Trail Blazers would be $40 million below the luxury tax, leaving them enough room to sign Toumani Camara to a contract and also have access to the non-tax midlevel exception. -- Marks Will it happen?: The bet here is this one gets done. The Blazers have added veterans to augment their young core, but Portland has expressed a belief that it can build upon its strong second half from last season. Keeping Sharpe and building on that momentum moving forward is part of that plan. -- Bontemps Walker Kessler , Utah Jazz Getting Walker Kessler’s extension done would ensure Utah’s rebuild would be anchored by a player who has shown dominant rim protection prowess under coach Will Hardy. Rob Gray-Imagn Images Why an extension could get done: Getting Kessler's extension done would allow the president of basketball operations, Austin Ainge, to ink a player who was a key part of the Rudy Gobert trade three years ago and keep him with the franchise through the end of the decade. It would also ensure Utah's rebuild would be anchored by a player who has shown dominant rim protection prowess under coach Will Hardy. -- Bontemps Why it might not: Getting selected outside of the lottery and then outplaying your first-round contract comes with a downside. Because Kessler was selected with the 22nd pick in 2022, his free agent cap hold next season is a modest $14.7 million. That means if the Jazz signed Kessler to a starting salary of $25 million for next season, they would then lose $10 million in cap flexibility. Including the Kessler hold, Utah projects to have a minimum of $50 million in room. -- Marks What I would offer: Five years, $116 million. The extension would be a win-win for both sides. For Kessler, the $20 million starting salary next season ranks in the top 15 among all centers. The Jazz, on the other hand, would lose only $4 million in cap flexibility next summer. -- Marks Will it happen?: This one is unlikely. Both sides have signaled it won't happen, and Kessler's low cap hold for next summer without an extension will make him a valuable trade option or a valuable player for the Jazz to retain and build around as they begin to move into the next phase of their rebuild under Ainge. -- Bontemps"}

(1:33) We're a week away from opening tipoff for the 2025-26 NBA season with a few familiar faces and some new ones ready to take the court starting Oct. 21. Victor Wembanyama will be back and healthy to start the season after being shut down last February because of a blood clot in his right shoulder. And Zion Williamson will be back after playing in only 30 games last season for the New Orleans Pelicans because of various injuries. But you'll have to wait to see a few notable superstars debut this season. Los Angeles Lakers front man LeBron James is expected to sit out three to four weeks, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Plus, Kyrie Irving appears to be working his way back from his season-ending ACL tear last March. Before we get caught up in the whirlwind of the regular season, our NBA insiders provide updates on the injury status of key players and break down who is primed to make a notable return during opening week and who to keep an eye on as the regular season progresses. Zion Williamson , F, New Orleans Pelicans There was skinny Jokic. Then skinny Doncic dazzled on the cover of Men's Health. Now it's skinny Zion who has many buzzing about the Pelicans this season, as he appears to be in his best shape since looking like a once-in-a-generation prospect at Duke. Williamson credits Daniel Bove, the Pelicans' director of performance and sports science, for helping him transform his body through boxing and working out on a football field while rehabbing from a hamstring injury that plagued him all last season. In six seasons in the league, Williamson has played 60 or more games only twice and was shut down last season in March after dealing with a bone bruise , having played only 30 games. \"I really felt a shift in my body to where I would look at [Bove] and say, 'Dude, it feels good to feel good.' I haven't felt like this since college, high school, where I can walk into a gym, I feel good.\" -- Ohm Youngmisuk Anthony Davis , F, Dallas Mavericks Davis was fully cleared weeks before training camp, having recovered from offseason surgery to repair a detached retina in his right eye . He will spend the preseason getting used to the protective glasses he'll have to wear the rest of his career, per doctor's orders, as well as shedding the 15 extra pounds he carried into training camp. The 6-foot-10 Davis, now listed at 268 pounds, downplayed any worries about his weight, saying it's normal for him to report to camp a little heavy. \"I never want to come in at my playing weight, because then I lose weight during the season and then I'm too small,\" Davis said. \"I lose about 10 to 12 pounds very quickly. ... So I'm never concerned about that. I feel great. I'm moving great. I feel good.\" -- Tim MacMahon Kristaps Porzingis , C, Atlanta Hawks Porzingis has a new home in Atlanta and the center, after dealing with a mysterious ailment that allowed him to play over 20 minutes in only one of his final six games with the Boston Celtics , says he's feeling good again. \"Honestly, I still don't have an exact answer,\" Porzingis said at Hawks media day when asked about what was bothering him. \"They had some sort of explanation for it, but it was lingering. That was the toughest part. Some days I was OK, energy was good and some days, boom, I had a crash. I'm glad it's gone now.\" Porzingis played for the Latvia national team at EuroBasket this past summer and the center said the tournament helped him get back into shape for the upcoming season. The Hawks will need a healthy Porzingis to stretch the floor and provide a defensive presence at the rim for Trae Young and the Hawks to contend in the East. \"I don't know, maybe it was just my system needed some reset during the summer,\" Porzingis said. \"I was really happy I had this summer, got in shape, played the tournament, I felt confident again like I have the gas tank again.\" -- Youngmisuk LaMelo Ball , G, Charlotte Hornets Ball spent time in the weight room this offseason to get stronger. After playing in a total of 105 games over the past three seasons combined because of injuries -- most recently being shut down last season to have surgery on his ankle and wrist -- Ball is determined to stay on the court. So far this preseason, coach Charles Lee and Ball have talked about the star point guard stepping up and leading the Hornets more this season. Lee said he has seen his point guard show some of his leadership in the weight room by adding muscle.

For more information, click here . \"I've noticed a different commitment level in that area,\" Lee said at Hornets media day. \"Melo noticed that he is always drawing the best, most physical defender. At times, they made it difficult on him. \"So this year, adding that weight room piece for him was really important. ... I think he has increased his lean muscle mass, he has increased his weight.\" -- Youngmisuk Victor Wembanyama , C, San Antonio Spurs Wembanyama was limited to 46 games last season because of right shoulder deep vein thrombosis. It motivated him to push himself physically and mentally this offseason in ways he has never experienced. He approached the offseason looking to try unconventional training methods , such as a 10-day retreat at a Shaolin temple in China, replete with meditation and kung fu training, and spent time working with Houston Rockets icon Hakeem Olajuwon . Early returns look promising. He has bullied defenders in the preseason and swatted shots from all over the court. Wembanyama is fully healthy and has improved his body control, adding upper- and lower-body strength. And according to the 21-year-old, the chances for a recurrence of DVT are very low. -- Michael C. Wright Tyrese Maxey , G, Philadelphia 76ers After sitting out the final few weeks of last season because of a finger injury -- one of many maladies during a season that, even by 76ers standards, felt particularly cursed -- Maxey is healthy and ready to go for the start of this season. He played in the two exhibition games in Abu Dhabi last week and is on track to begin the season as the starting point guard. Given the number of other injuries Philadelphia is already dealing with, the fact that Maxey is ready to go will be music to the ears of coach Nick Nurse. -- Tim Bontemps Ja Morant , G, Memphis Grizzlies Morant's goal to \"play 82,\" as he stated at media day, is already in jeopardy. He's considered week-to-week after spraining his left ankle during practice the day before the Grizzlies' preseason opener. Morant's acrobatic game makes durability an issue for the star guard. That's why Morant, whose popularity is fueled by his high-flying highlights, declared last season that he is \"not trying to dunk at all,\" prioritizing protecting himself over entertaining fans. Since serving a 25-game suspension to start the 2023-24 season, Morant has played in only 59 games. He has been sidelined during that stretch by a variety of injuries -- shoulder, hip, thigh, knee, back, foot, hamstring and ankle. -- MacMahon Jaren Jackson Jr ., F, Memphis Grizzlies • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Jackson's availability for the Oct. 22 season opener is in doubt as he works his way back from an early July surgery to repair a turf toe injury in his right foot. The Grizzlies announced entering training camp that Jackson would be able to return to play in four to six weeks, putting the two-time All-Star's timetable in late October or early November. The surgery occurred a couple of days after Jackson officially agreed to a five-year, $240 million contract extension, but the Grizzlies' front office was aware of the severity of the injury when that deal was finalized. -- MacMahon LeBron James , F, Los Angeles Lakers James will make history whenever he appears in his first game this season, becoming the only NBA player to have played 23 seasons. But for the first time in his career, James is injured before the season opener, ending his streak of playing in Game No. 1 for 22 straight years. James is dealing with sciatica down the right side of his body, according to the Lakers, and won't be reevaluated for another two to three weeks and has been limited to light shooting in training camp thus far, sitting out every practice and preseason game. James hinted at the injury -- which was sustained sometime in late July or early August during an on-court workout, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania -- during the team's media day when he told ESPN, \"I'm not where I want to be [physically].\" James also said he would be sure to stay connected to the team while he rehabilitated. \"My presence is going to be important,\" James told ESPN. \"Making sure that even if I'm not on the floor, I'm always in tune to what we're doing -- so I know what's going on at all times.\" -- Dave McMenamin Zach Edey , C, Memphis Grizzlies Edey sit out at least the first two weeks of the season while recovering from offseason ankle surgery, according to the timetable the Grizzlies announced entering training camp. At the time, the team said that Edey could return to play in six to nine weeks. The longer end of that timetable would be the final weekend of November. Backup center Brandon Clarke also will sit out time to start the season while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery, so the Grizzlies will have a glaring lack of depth in the frontcourt. Memphis will have to rely heavily on journeyman Jock Landale , an offseason addition who has averaged 12.8 minutes while playing for three teams in his four-year NBA career. -- MacMahon Jalen Williams , F, Oklahoma City Thunder Williams initially suffered a fairly severe wrist injury -- a torn scapholunate ligament -- late in the regular season while grappling for a loose ball with Devin Booker in Phoenix. He played through it, estimating he needed nearly 30 painkilling shots during the Thunder's run to the title. That delayed surgery until July 1, attached to a 12-week reevaluation clock, which expired right before training camp. The team hasn't officially ruled Williams in or out for the regular-season opener, but he hasn't been in the contact portions of practice and has been spotted working only individually on the side, predominantly using his left hand. \"Still got some ways to go with it,\" Williams said at media day. -- Anthony Slater Shams Charania explains the significance of the Thunder locking up their core after Jalen Williams' extension. Jared McCain , G, Philadelphia 76ers Last season, McCain was well on his way to winning the league's Rookie of the Year award when he suffered a meniscus injury that cut things short after only 23 games last December -- adding to the injury bug that plagued Philadelphia last season. But while McCain is fully healed from that injury, he tore a tendon in his right (shooting) thumb that required surgery last month, an issue that will cost him time at the start of the regular season. Though the 76ers have plenty of guard depth, they also want to get McCain on the court with both Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe , the No. 3 pick in the June draft. -- Bontemps De'Aaron Fox , G, San Antonio Spurs Last March, Fox opted to undergo season-ending surgery to repair tendon damage in his left pinkie finger and recovered just fine from that setback, only to suffer a strained right hamstring during a summer workout that leaves in question his availability for San Antonio's Oct. 22 season opener at Dallas. Fox acknowledged he would sit out the preseason while expressing doubt he'd be ready to play in the opener. But internally, the team has been encouraged by Fox's progress. It's worth noting that San Antonio traditionally errs on the side of caution when bringing players back from injuries. It certainly helps that the roster features a glut of guards that includes last season's NBA Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and No. 2 pick Dylan Harper . -- Wright Dejounte Murray , G, New Orleans Pelicans Murray has spent six days a week in the training room, rehabbing and working his way back from a ruptured right Achilles tendon suffered at the end of January, and could be back this January. The point guard is eager to return after his first season in New Orleans was limited to only 31 games, as he was also hampered by a broken hand. Murray averaged 17.5 points, 7.4 assists, 6.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals after coming in a trade from Atlanta. \"I've been having fun seeing the progression, knowing that day it all happened, I just couldn't walk and couldn't feel my calf. It was a challenge and I accepted it.\" -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid , C, Philadelphia 76ers In a familiar feeling for the 76ers and their fans -- most unfortunately -- there is no bigger health question in the league than Embiid, and specifically his troublesome left knee. For more than a calendar year, it has been unclear when, or if, Embiid is going to be right again, and he reiterated that at media day last month. \"I've had so many injuries,\" Embiid said. \"The only thing I've always told myself is you can't give up.\" Though both Embiid and the 76ers are not giving up on the superstar center returning to the dominant form that led to winning the league's MVP award for the 2023 season, it remains unclear when he will be back on the court, be it at the start of the season or sometime after that. -- Bontemps Shams Charania joins \"NBA Today\" to explain why there is no set timeline for Joel Embiid to return from injury. Darius Garland , G, Cleveland Cavaliers After his postseason was affected by a turf toe injury, Garland opted to have surgery in June, one that is likely to sideline him for the first few weeks of the regular season. Garland said at media day last week that his recovery is on schedule and that he's running and doing on-court work. He remains out of participating with the team in practices to start the preseason, and isn't expected to be ready to play in any exhibition games. But Cleveland has made it clear that it isn't going to rush Garland back -- given the Cavaliers are hoping to be playing into June, and need Garland at 100% to do that. -- Bontemps Paul George , F, Philadelphia 76ers George's status for the start of the season remains unclear after it was announced he'd undergone an arthroscopic surgery after suffering an injury in an offseason workout -- an ominous sign after only playing in half the games in his first season in 2024-25. George, who has done some on-court work, said, \"I do think I will be at a good place, hopefully earlier than later. Can't get any worse than last year. That was a rock-bottom type of season.\" We'll see if last season was, in fact, as bad as it can get, but the 76ers will be hoping George can be back either by opening night or soon thereafter. -- Bontemps Kyrie Irving , G, Dallas Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd went out of his way to push back against the perception that Irving is \"ahead of schedule\" in his recovery from a torn ACL suffered in early March. But Irving's progress is evident, and he hasn't been shy about putting the proof on display with his post-practice work during media access periods. Irving isn't only taking spot-up jump shots. He's working on his legendary isolation game, making one- and two-dribble moves against the defense of a team staffer. He often takes turns with No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg during these sessions, helping teach the 18-year-old rookie some tricks of the trade. When will Irving join Flagg in game action? Irving, 33, doesn't want to set a specific target date, preferring to pour himself into the daily grind. The Mavs would be happy to have Irving back in the mix around the All-Star break, which would give him about two months to chip off rust and ramp up before the postseason. -- MacMahon Mavs coach Jason Kidd dismisses reports that Kyrie Irving is ahead of schedule in his recovery. Lauri Markkanen , F, Utah Jazz A variety of injuries, most notably a lower-back issue, limited Markkanen last season to a career-low 47 games. But he bounced back over the summer and looked healthy, leading Finland to the bronze medal game at EuroBasket with a 29-point performance that included 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in an upset win over Nikola Jokic and Serbia. Markkanen sustained a left wrist bruise during the tournament, which forced him out of preseason games and has limited him for a good portion of the team's training camp. Markkanen said he's rehabbing daily, feeling better, and making progress, but added he's \"not sure of what the exact date is when I'm gonna start\" playing again. -- Wright"}

Here are the most noteworthy storylines from 14 of the league's most intriguing teams.", "body": "The NBA's preseason is drawing to a close The curtain will rise on the 2025-26 season in Oklahoma City on Tuesday, when the defending champion Thunder will celebrate their first title as they host former Thunder star Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets . And while much of the preseason is about rounding into shape and getting to the start of the season healthy, there are still things that can be gleaned from the early October action. To take stock of where things sit after most of the exhibition slate has been played, our NBA reporters -- Tim Bontemps, Jamal Collier, Vince Goodwill, Baxter Holmes, Tim MacMahon, Dave McMenamin, Anthony Slater, Michael C. Wright and Ohm Youngmisuk -- provided their takeaways on several contenders from each conference, and what each franchise looks like heading into the upcoming season. Jump to a team: ATL | CLE | DAL DET | GSW | HOU LAC | LAL | MIL NYK | OKC | ORL PHI | SAS Charles Barkley weighs in on Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Bucks after Milwaukee had trade conversations with the Knicks earlier in the offseason. One of the early observations made by players during the first days of Hawks camp was that everyone was on the court, and the trainer's room was empty. The Hawks are healthy and buzzing over new additions Kristaps Porzingis , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard . Being healthy again is vital to the Hawks' success and growth. A huge factor for Atlanta this season is Jalen Johnson , who looked good in his first two preseason games back from left shoulder surgery that ended his 2024-25 season; Johnson made 7 of 11 shots and had 20 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in 25 minutes against Memphis. Coach Quin Snyder said Johnson's improvement on defense will be the next step for the young forward. If he can stay healthy and continue to grow as a playmaker to help Young and Porzingis, the Hawks could really take off this season. -- Youngmisuk The Cavaliers have a lot of depth, and they will need it. Max Strus is likely out for a few months with a Jones fracture in his left foot. Darius Garland will miss the opening weeks of the season as well after offseason turf toe surgery. New addition Lonzo Ball is not going to play back-to-backs, and he played 35 games last season for the Chicago Bulls after missing the prior two seasons with injuries. De'Andre Hunter has never played more than 67 games and has missed at least 25 games in three of his six seasons. And Dean Wade has eclipsed 60 games in only one of his six seasons. So while Cleveland feels good about where it sits after claiming the top seed in the East last season, it is already navigating injuries -- and likely will be throughout this season. -- Bontemps Giving third-year forward Ausar Thompson more responsibility has come into focus. The team began to take off last season when his health restrictions (blood clot) were lifted and his two-way prowess was unleashed. Now, the Pistons view him as a secondary ball handler, initiating offense as a change-of-pace guard to contrast the more deliberate Cade Cunningham . Coach J.B. Bickerstaff noted how Thompson initiated some offense with Cunningham on the floor to present a different look. With Jaden Ivey (left fibula) still \"dealing with some discomfort,\" according to Bickerstaff, the team is bringing him along slowly, thus creating more opportunity for Thompson on offense. As for Cunningham, preseason is the smallest of sample sizes, but according to sources, \"he's proving last year wasn't a fluke.\" -- Goodwill The 18-year-old rookie scored 10 points and contributed 6 rebounds, 3 assists and a blocked shot in 14 minutes. The Giannis saga is far from over. Despite attempts from the Bucks to quell speculation over Antetokounmpo 's future since the start of camp, the two-time MVP has simultaneously emphasized his current commitment to the Bucks while leaving the door open that he could continue his career elsewhere . Antetokounmpo has doubled down on his desire to compete for championships with an unwillingness to accept anything less. It has put the pressure on the Bucks this season to prove he can win another championship in Milwaukee. For a team that has lost in the first round in three consecutive seasons, not advancing further in the playoffs could lead to a day of reckoning. -- Collier Off the floor, the Antetokounmpo situation will hang over the team all season following the revelation that the Knicks and Bucks discussed a potential trade of the power forward this offseason. Several key players will be on notice and have an eye on what's going on with Milwaukee to track Antetokounmpo's frame of mind. On the floor, the Knicks want to play faster on offense and shoot more 3s, but it has been a work in progress through four preseason games. The Knicks have a favorable schedule to start the season, which should provide an early window into how the Mike Brown era will look in New York. -- Goodwill The Magic are getting healthier, and that is a big deal. Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner started camp healthy after both dealt with oblique injuries last season; they missed a combined total of 58 regular-season games. Orlando isn't whole yet, though. Guard Jalen Suggs is still slowly making his way back from left knee surgery and Mo Wagner remains out with a torn left ACL sustained in December 2024. In the meantime, Banchero, Wagner and the rest of the Magic will try to develop chemistry as quickly as possible with new addition Desmond Bane while hoping to drastically improve on their league-worst 31.8% 3-point shooting last season. The Magic have started out camp playing faster, focusing on getting out in transition and using defense to create offense. Through the first three preseason games, the Magic averaged 104 possessions. They averaged a league-low 96.5 last season. The most important thing will be going into the season with Banchero, Wagner and Bane healthy and hoping Suggs can add to the team once he is ready. -- Youngmisuk Joel Embiid might be healthy? That feels strange to say after everything that has happened over the past 18 months, but so far it has been a relatively stress-free preseason in Philadelphia. Embiid appears on track to be ready for the 76ers' opener against the rival Celtics on Oct. 22. Anyone who has followed Embiid's tenure in Philadelphia knows how quickly things can change, and he has had enough issues with his left knee that it's fair to wonder how long it will last until another flareup. Embiid said at the start of training camp they're just taking things day-by-day. But unlike last year, when his preseason was a waiting game to see when his knee would be ready to go, Embiid has practiced regularly, participated in Sunday's open scrimmage and is expected to play Friday against Minnesota in Philadelphia's preseason finale. -- Bontemps Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The mantra of Dallas GM Nico Harrison is \" defense wins championships ,\" but the Mavericks have some things to figure out on that end of the floor, particularly on the perimeter. Coach Jason Kidd said he has to \"continue to look at different combinations to see what gives us the best way to start the game\" after the Hornets scored 95 points through three quarters as the Mavs played their starters into the second half. Klay Thompson was tasked with being the primary defender on Charlotte star LaMelo Ball , which is probably asking too much of a 35-year-old with his injury history. The options are limited if D'Angelo Russell starts alongside Thompson. P.J. Washington typically took the toughest perimeter defensive assignment last season, but he came off the bench in the first two preseason games. Would the Mavs be better off starting Washington with 18-year-old Cooper Flagg as the primary offensive initiator? That's the look Kidd went with against the Utah Jazz on Monday, when Russell rested. -- MacMahon The headliners aren't showing any alarming signs of age at the moment. Al Horford has fit the culture and system well so far. One of the leftover questions is how exactly Steve Kerr will deploy his starting lineup around Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . Horford will start at center on some nights, but Kerr said he wants to be careful considering Horford's age and the need to limit his minutes. \"If Al were a little younger, he'd be in the starting lineup for sure,\" Kerr said. Kerr has hinted that he might employ a small-ball unit that includes Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski . But Moody hurt his left calf in practice and his status is uncertain to start the season. Podziemski punctuated a great camp with a 23-point night in Los Angeles against the Lakers. Kerr wouldn't officially commit to him as the starting shooting guard, but the presumed lineup for opening night is Curry, Podziemski, Butler, Green, Horford -- though it is anticipated Kerr will change it around often. -- Slater Houston's offensive initiation by committee approach will work out just fine in the wake of veteran point guard Fred VanVleet 's season-ending injury. Rockets coach Ime Udoka often throws around the term \"KYP\" (know your personnel) in news conferences. Perhaps that intricate knowledge of Houston's roster played a major role in Udoka's confidence that his group \"can get the job done\" in VanVleet's absence. Early returns in the preseason have been promising with the Rockets utilizing multiple players -- mainly center Alperen Sengun and forward Amen Thompson -- to initiate offense. Expect Houston to also lean on Durant to facilitate the offense along with second-year guard Reed Sheppard , who appears to be growing more confident in his role. -- Wright Playing beneath the cloud of an NBA investigation -- and one centered around a team's star player -- is no small thing. But it appears the Clippers, for now, are resolved to not let that inquiry serve as a distraction. Through two preseason games, Kawhi Leonard appears in midseason form. He scored 18 points in 18 minutes in one game and 17 points in 19 minutes in the other. New acquisitions Brook Lopez and John Collins have seemed to fit in already, and Chris Paul 's reunion with the Clippers feels seamless. The Clippers boast one of the league's oldest rosters, but it's also among the deepest, which should help some of their more veteran players as the season moves along. There are a few preseason games left, not that those offer concrete evidence of the season to come, but despite the small sample size, the rebuilt Clippers appear especially promising. -- Holmes Dave McMenamin confirms that LeBron James will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica. The extra time to practice and jell together that the team pined for after last season's abrupt first-round exit was not to be. Unfortunately, training camp didn't provide the opportunity everyone hoped for. LeBron James was limited to being a vocal participant in the Lakers' scrimmages from the sidelines because of sciatica down his right side , which also kept him out of the preseason. Luka Doncic was purposely held out of the majority of L.A.'s preseason slate and was given a modified workload for a handful of practice days, with the medical staff cognizant of his EuroBasket duty over the summer . Marcus Smart , signed in the offseason, was out with Achilles tendinopathy. Maxi Kleber , who was only healthy and available for one game after being acquired from Dallas in the Doncic trade in February, missed most of camp with a quad injury. Rookie Adou Thiero was also limited because of knee swelling. \"These are the cards we were dealt,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"I surely would like everybody to be healthy.\" -- McMenamin All-NBA wing Jalen Williams is unlikely to be ready for the start of the regular season as he continues to recover from surgery on his right wrist, an operation he had on July 1 , after playing the entire postseason with torn ligaments. \"I would have cut my right hand off to win a championship,\" Williams told ESPN. He has only recently begun to shoot with his right hand again and has yet to be cleared for contact work. The Thunder and Williams have not publicly discussed a timetable for his return as they take a patient approach. \"Whenever I feel like I can be a hundred percent and do that whole thing, then I'll rock out,\" Williams said. -- MacMahon The Spurs will look different this season. Team president and former coach Gregg Popovich has always encouraged new coach Mitch Johnson to be himself. It'll be apparent on the floor this season as Johnson incorporates more of his own principles in San Antonio during his first full season on the job. Victor Wembanyama made that point clear in describing how the staff put together \"a more extended plan\" over the summer that emphasizes \"better recognition of our roles together.\" Veteran Harrison Barnes pointed out, \"We have a lot of new stuff that we're doing,\" adding, \"We've changed some of the processes of how we're doing [things]. That comes with Mitch implementing his style, which I think has been well-received by players.\" Expect the Spurs to flex their collective youth and athleticism to play a faster style. -- Wright"}

(0:53) The latest season of Netflix's \"Starting 5\" was released Thursday, offering new perspectives on memorable moments from the 2024-25 campaign. The series followed Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton , then- Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant , LA Clippers guard James Harden and Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown . Each star had his own challenges last season, all revealed by Netflix's behind-the-scenes access. \"The Netflix people are driving me nuts,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said at one point. \"They're everywhere, you know, and it's a pain in the ass.\" Durant dealt with injuries and trade talk that nearly sent him to the Golden State Warriors . Haliburton fought through a midseason slump after limited action at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. Brown's knee injury was a setback for the Celtics in their pursuit of winning back-to-back titles. Harden embarked on another season seeking a championship, while Gilgeous-Alexander's consistency fueled the Thunder's NBA title aspirations. The outcome brought two of the season's stars to the biggest stage: Game 7 of the Finals. Here are the top takeaways from Season 2 of \"Starting 5.\" The early days of the Oklahoma City Thunder paired two of the game's top scorers on one team: Durant and Harden. They were teammates for three seasons before the Thunder dealt Harden to the Houston Rockets in 2012, propelling the guard to All-Star and MVP heights. Even though the trade happened over a decade ago, emotions are still raw for Durant and Harden, who won Sixth Man of the Year that season. Alongside Russell Westbrook , the Thunder were coming off a Finals run in which they lost in five games to the Miami Heat . Unable to reach a contract extension , Oklahoma City traded Harden. He explained that it \"wasn't about no real money. It was a couple million dollars.\" Durant admitted he didn't know what was going on with Harden's contract negotiations until the very end and \"never thought there was a possibility he was leaving.\" He also expressed anger about the reaction leaguewide, with players posting congratulatory messages for Harden on social media. \"I was like, 'Shut the f--- up. Y'all just was f---ing scared. Y'all knew we was on the way.\" Durant said. Harden echoed a similar sentiment. \"Overall, I was mad as hell, too,\" he said. \"Cause I got the call, and it's like, then there was loss. These are my dawgs, like you see what we just did these last three years? It was like, 'we're gonna win a championship next year.' ... I was hurt. It was sad, for real.\" Durant said he liked playing with Harden and he misses it. However, he pointed out that he, Harden and Westbrook all maximized their potential, which is most important. Prior to leading the Pacers on a surprising NBA Finals run, Haliburton found himself in a dark place early in the 2024-25 season. His confidence took a hit after he played in just three games for Team USA in the Paris Olympics. The All-Star guard struggled in November and December, averaging 18.1 points and nine assists on 44% shooting from the field as Indiana entered 2025 with a 16-18 record. \"I honestly don't think I've ever felt as negative about myself as I did in November and December,\" Haliburton said. \"Yeah, I was definitely in a dark time.\" • Tyran Stokes aims to join LeBron, Iverson and more • A full guide each team's NHL goalie mask for the 2025-26 season • Is there a Taylor Swift curse on Purdue? • Vladdy tilts ALDS Game 2 with grand slam • Archaeologist Daniel Jones? Colts' QB embracing 'Indiana Jones' nickname His fiancée, Jade Jones, could tell Haliburton was feeling pressure from his play and was struggling to identify the root cause of his slump. The highest-paid player on the Pacers, Haliburton said players such as himself are only evaluated on whether they can impact their respective team to win games. If they don't, it's next man up. \"It got to the point where I was like, 'Should I kind of step away for a little bit just for our group? Would that be more beneficial?'\" Haliburton said. \"I know that if I'm not right, that our team isn't gonna be right.\" A conversion with his trainer, renowned NBA skills coach Drew Hanlen, aided Haliburton's turnaround. He also returned to Paris in late January with the Pacers facing the San Antonio Spurs . This time, Haliburton performed. He dropped 28 points in Indiana's 136-98 win, and the rest was history. Gilgeous-Alexander and Paul developed a strong bond in the one season they spent as teammates with the Thunder in 2019-20. The 2025 MVP called Paul a mentor and friend, and he leaned on him for advice. After Denver Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon nailed a game winner against the Thunder in Game 1 of their second-round playoff series, Gilgeous-Alexander FaceTimed Paul when he got home. The two reviewed moments from the game. Paul also attended Game 2 of Oklahoma City's Western Conference finals series against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Gilgeous-Alexander received his MVP award that night as Paul sat courtside next to Gilgeous-Alexander's wife. The Thunder guard playfully put Paul in a chokehold after the game, saying, \"Now you stuck. Now you don't know what to do. Now what?\" \"Ima just chop your wrist off. It's gonna be with me,\" Paul replied, and the 12-time All-Star went to Gilgeous-Alexander's house for dinner afterward. Haliburton and the Pacers' shocking comebacks were a huge storyline of the postseason, and \"Starting 5.\" There may not have been a single comeback with larger ramifications than Game 1 of the NBA Finals. The Thunder seemed to be in cruise control, holding a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter. However, Indiana was in a position it had seen before that postseason and slowly walked Oklahoma City down -- something Haliburton said the Pacers tried to do in each of their other comeback wins. Indiana, down one with less than 10 seconds remaining, had the ball after Gilgeous-Alexander missed a jumper. \"They get the rebound come down, don't call a timeout. [Haliburton] gets it to his right hand. He loves his right hand. That's where he goes,\" Gilgeous-Alexander explained. Haliburton then dribbled toward the right wing and rose up for a go-ahead jumper. \"It felt like slow motion. Like the ball's in the air forever. I'm just like, 'It's going in,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"I didn't even know how to react, so I just yell,\" Haliburton said, as the Pacers stole Game 1. The improbable Game 1 comeback set up the best two words in a playoff series: Game 7. Unfortunately, Haliburton's outing ended prematurely due to a torn Achilles just halfway through the first quarter. Netflix mic'd Haliburton up during the game and followed him to the locker room. The Pacers star -- who had nine points before exiting -- explained he wanted to heat check a 3-pointer, but didn't like the opportunity. Therefore, he swung the ball, knowing it would rotate back to him with the intention of attacking his defender, Gilgeous-Alexander. However, when he went to drive to the basket, the injury occurred. \"I knew what it was,\" Haliburton said. \"I turn around and look to see who's on the floor, I was like, 'Oh s---, no way.' And then I seen him screaming,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. The first five minutes of Starting 5 Season 2? Absolute CINEMA 🍿 Premiering on Netflix in 10 HOURS. pic.twitter.com/FWv797eBRl Haliburton revealed that he wanted to walk off, recalling that Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant walked off when he tore his Achilles. \"I can walk off. Like, it's possible. So I was like, 'Get me up, I'm gonna walk off.' It felt like just dead weight at the end of my leg,\" he said. \"I think that's when I became overcome with emotion just because that's when the reality really set in.\" Haliburton broke down in tears in the locker room with Jones, his father and his mother by his side. He got his ankle wrapped in ice and watched the rest of the game in the trainer's room, saying to the TV: \"Make it worth it, at least.\" With Indiana leading at halftime, Haliburton revealed that his biggest regret was not giving a halftime speech to the team. Oklahoma City ended up winning 103-91 to claim the championship."}

So which bets stand out? We asked our NBA betting experts André Snellings, Eric Moody, Eric Karabell, Jim McCormick and Steve Alexander to identify their favorite futures bet to make heading into the 2025-26 season. You're not going to break the bank with this one, but Luka has a huge chip on his shoulder after last season's shocking trade that sent him to the Lakers. And with LeBron James banged up to start the season, Doncic has a chance to be a one-man wrecking crew for the foreseeable future. He should challenge to lead the league in scoring and could average a triple-double this season. If the Lakers perform well, he should be solidly in the running to win MVP. And I think he will. -- Alexander Doncic averaged 28.2 PPG after his acquisition from Dallas last season, but we should expect him to be more comfortable -- and aggressive -- in his first full season with the Lakers. Remember, Doncic led the league in scoring at 33.9 PPG in 2023-24. It wasn't so long ago! In addition, LeBron is out to start the season as noted above, and it's not like Deandre Ayton will pick up his scoring slack. This is Luka's team! Perhaps we should take the odds on him winning MVP (+425) as well! -- Karabell Antetokounmpo is flying under the radar at these odds, but he has a real shot to reclaim the award. He's coming off back-to-back seasons averaging over 30 PPG, 11.5 RPG and 6.5 APG. In 14 games without Damian Lillard , he increased that to 31.1 PPG and 7.9 APG. With Lillard gone and Myles Turner spacing the floor, Giannis will have the ball in his hands more than ever. In a weaker Eastern Conference, Milwaukee should win a ton of games, and Antetokounmpo could post undeniable numbers that put him right back in the MVP conversation. -- Moody It's not a massive reward, but the Hawks are deeper and more dynamic than last season, and arguably have a better path to becoming a true two-way power than Orlando and its lack of shooting and creation. No disrespect to the Hawks team that upset Philadelphia to go the Eastern Conference Finals, but this current roster appears to be the best yet in the Trae Young era. -- McCormick • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list The Wolves are quietly one of the elite teams in the Western Conference, but because they were the No. 6 seed last season their excellence isn't immediately clear. Two seasons ago, they were tied with the Thunder and Nuggets for the best record in the Western Conference going into the final day of the season, then went on to the Western Conference Finals. Last season, they traded staple player Karl-Anthony Towns for a package including Julius Randle just before the season and struggled for months before finding their level late. From there, they were one of the hottest teams in the league over the final couple months of the season and again made the Western Conference Finals. They kept the core of their team together this offseason, but team leader Anthony Edwards should be even better at age 24 and as a team they should be much stronger this regular season than last. With this bet, they are getting plus money to reach a level they've surpassed two straight seasons and, if healthy, should do so again this season. -- Snellings"}

Create or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today! Sign up today! Embiid will participate in 62 games and average 28 PPG, 10 RPG and 1.5 BPG, making him a fourth- or fifth-round bargain. It is so easy to be pessimistic about Embiid and not only the constant concerns about him staying healthy, but the numbers when he does play. Many forget he averaged 67 games for the 2021 and 2022 seasons and the numbers were fantastic. It really wasn't that long ago. OK, so perhaps Embiid sits all/most situations with back-to-back games, but I will be optimistic and predict big things for Embiid and the 76ers, even if I remain scared to invest top-30 draft capital in fantasy. -- Karabell Davis is being drafted in the first round of fantasy drafts, but I don't see it. It looks to me like he's somewhat out of shape and hasn't done much to get excited about in the preseason, and his injury history is staggering. Add in that Kyrie Irving is not likely to play this season, and it's hard to see the Mavericks having a lot to play for down the stretch. I'm letting someone else draft Davis in all of my leagues, as the risk is too great. -- Alexander Everyone's treating Williamson like a risky fantasy pick, but the ceiling is massive. He put up 24.6 PPG, 7.2 RPG and 5.3 APG in 30 games last season and also posted career-best marks in steals and blocks. Yes, durability is a concern, as he has played 30 or fewer games in four of six seasons, but he enters 2025-26 in the best shape of his career. If he stays healthy, Williamson can smash his ADP (33.0) and finish inside the top 20. -- Moody Last season marked a career effort statistically, yet it still wasn't elite production compared with the high bar set at point guard in the NBA. I am a fan of Murray's game from a real basketball lens, but not as enthused in fantasy given the lack of any single special category. Denver capably replaced the usage and shooting volume of Michael Porter Jr . (with Cameron Johnson ) and arguably has more shot creation rostered than last season. -- McCormick I am higher on Sheppard than most. I think he is a clear top-60 player in category leagues and has similar upside in points leagues. Coming out of the 2024 NBA draft, I had Sheppard as the player in his class most ready to produce, with a consistent 3-point shot and strong combo guard skills. But Sheppard was drafted to a Rockets team with too many quality perimeter options to get an opportunity as a rookie. After the team traded two perimeter starters for Kevin Durant and lost Fred VanVleet to injury, Sheppard is now poised to earn starter's minutes and an honorary \"Sophomore of the Year\" award this season. -- Snellings"}

Russell Westbrook rises in the rankings after finally signing ... with the Sacramento Kings . Westbrook joins a backcourt where Dennis Schroder was the presumptive starting point guard, and regardless who starts it is likely both will play significant minutes. Westbrook has positive history with many of his new teammates, including Schroder, and is now solidified as a top-100 fantasy prospect in points leagues. Schroder takes a very small hit to his projections, since he may lose a few minutes to Westbrook. Keegan Murray will miss the next 4-6 weeks with a torn UCL ligament in his left thumb. If those estimates hold true, he would miss between 12 and 19 games before he could return. Ace Bailey is experiencing knee tendinitis in both knees. He may miss some time in the preseason, though it isn't clear whether this issue will officially impact his regular season availability. Nevertheless, as a rookie with a lot of unknowns at this level, this news caused me to drop his projected games played slightly which brings him down a bit in the rankings. 1.

Paul George is not expected to play in the Philadelphia 76ers ' season opener Wednesday against the Boston Celtics and still \"has some checkmarks he has to hit\" in his return to play following the left arthroscopic knee surgery he underwent in the offseason, ESPN's Shams Charania reports . The nine-time All Star's return could come in the not-too-distant future -- \"shortly into the regular season,\" per Charania -- and he participated in some five-on-five action in Thursday's practice. \"We are trying to get him through the thresholds of five-on-zero to some smaller-numbered live action yesterday, and then he jumped into a bit of five-on-five live today,\" coach Nick Nurse said Thursday . \"Just trying to keep moving him in the right direction.\" When asked if there's optimism about George's potential availability for the season opener, Nurse seemed skeptical. \"Nah,\" Nurse said. \"Yesterday was his first day live -- I mean small-number live -- and today was a short amount of five-on-five, so we have to just keep waiting.\" George, 35, had the surgery in mid-July after suffering an injury during a workout. It came just over a year after he agreed to a four-year, $212 million deal with Philadelphia the previous offseason. It was a brutally disappointing 2024-25 for both George and the 76ers. George struggled with several injuries, appeared in just 41 games and averaged just 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists. The 16.2 points per game were his lowest since 2014-15, in which he only appeared in eight games. The 76ers, who were also without Joel Embiid (limited to just 19 games) and Tyrese Maxey (52 games) for significant stretches, shut George down for the season in May. The 76ers, given Embiid and George's ages and injury histories, are one of the most difficult teams to project in 2025-26, even in what appears to be a wide-open Eastern Conference. When healthy, Philadelphia has plenty of star power and a solid supporting cast with Quentin Grimes , Jared McCain , Kelly Oubre Jr . and VJ Edgecombe , the No. 3 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft . Health, however, has been fleeting, and the team will hope George's likely absence to begin the year isn't a harbinger of injuries to come. The 76ers will close out their preseason schedule against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. While George won't play, Nurse said there's a chance Embiid could suit up in the preseason finale as he ramps up for the regular season. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Detroit Pistons have high hopes for the 2025-26 season after making the playoffs this past summer. Along with the continued development of star guard Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren , the Pistons were looking forward to the return of young guard Jaden Ivey to the lineup after he missed much of last season after breaking his leg 30 games into the year. Unfortunately, Ivey's return to the Pistons' lineup will be delayed for a few weeks. The team announced on Thursday that the fourth-year guard had a procedure to \"relieve right knee discomfort.\" The Pistons made clear that the knee issue is unrelated to his broken fibula from last season. Ivey will be re-evaluated in four weeks, which means he'll likely be out for even longer, meaning the Pistons will probably have to go the first month of the season without his presence in the lineup. Detroit's backcourt will take a different shape this season than what we saw a year ago. Cunningham is back as the leader, but Dennis Schröder is in Sacramento, Tim Hardaway Jr . is in Denver and Malik Beasley is still in limbo amid federal and NBA investigations into gambling allegations. Ivey was expected to take on a significant role with that trio moving on. While he is recovering from the knee procedure, offseason additions like Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson figure to get even bigger minutes than expected, while Ron Holland and Ausar Thompson might spend some time at the two. Ivey was in the midst of his best season when he suffered his broken leg, averaging 17.6 points per game and shooting 40.9% from 3-point range. He'll have to wait a bit longer than he hoped to return to the court to try and pick up where he left off prior to his injury. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Milwaukee Bucks and guard AJ Green agreed to a four-year, $45 million contract extension on Thursday, Green's agent told ESPN's Shams Charania . Green is coming off the best season of his young career in which he averaged 9.4 points per game and shot 42.7% from 3-point range, the 12th-best mark in the NBA among 174 qualifying players. He shot an even more impressive 44.5% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. The Bucks also outscored opponents by 3.1 points per game when Green was on the floor last season, the second-best plus-minus per game on the team behind only superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . Green represents a major developmental success for Milwaukee. An undrafted free agent out of Northern Iowa in 2022, Green got a Summer League invitation from the Bucks and spent the 2022-23 season on a two-way contract. He signed a three-year, $6.3 million contract in the summer of 2023 and now has earned by far the biggest payday of his career. The Bucks hope Green can continue his upward trajectory, and he will play a big role this year in a backcourt that includes veterans Cole Anthony , Gary Trent Jr. , Kevin Porter Jr. and Gary Harris , among others. Green has played in all four preseason games this year and is averaging the second-most points (11.3) and minutes (20.4) on the team while shooting 46% from deep. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

On the Portland Trail Blazers ' first day of training camp, coach Chauncey Billups took a moment to give the team's rising star, Shaedon Sharpe , a bit of advice. While practice continued on the court in front of them, Billups draped his left arm around Sharpe's neck and dropped the knowledge that only a former NBA Finals MVP and five-time All-Star can. \"You're a great playmaker,\" Billups told the 22-year-old Sharpe. \"If I could have the ball in your hands, you coming downhill at somebody, see the whole floor, everything's going to open up in a blender? I want that all the time.\" Billups and the Blazers are bullish on Sharpe this season, his fourth in the league. The 6-foot-5 guard has improved his scoring average each year, from 9.9 points in his rookie campaign to 15.9 and then to 18.5 last season. And he's set for an even bigger offensive role this year. With the team trading away Anfernee Simons , who led the team in scoring last season (19.3 points per game), Portland will need a go-to scorer, and the obvious candidate is Sharpe. In addition, Billups has stressed to the team all offseason about playing at a faster tempo to take advantage of the Blazers' strengths: youth and athleticism. And that style of play only benefits the freakily talented Sharpe. Those are just some of the reasons why SportsLine player prop expert Alex Selesnick is high on Sharpe this season. Selesnick, who is 1,008-799 and up $3,213 on all prop picks since joining CBS Sports in 2021, has made Sharpe to win Most Improved Player (+2000) one of his four best prop picks for the upcoming NBA season. \"Sharpe has always been long on talent and a natural scorer, however I like his chances of taking a major step forward as he is going to lead Portland in shot attempts,\" Selesnick says. \"And at just 22-years-old he is still developing. We caught a glimpse of what that might look like last season with Sharpe averaging over 25 points per game over the final three weeks.\" In the team's first preseason game , Sharpe picked up where he left off last season, scoring 22 points in just 23 minutes on 9-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-8 on 3-pointers. Sharpe says he spent the offseason working on his 3-point shot while studying film on other players who play his position, including Anthony Edwards and Devin Booker . \"There's always room for improvement,\" Sharpe says. \"So I'm [going to] keep building on what we have here, and what I'm trying to accomplish.\" Here are Selesnick's top non-player futures for the upcoming NBA season. Nuggets to win NBA Finals (+600) This is a position I opened right at the start of NBA free agency after seeing some of the moves Denver made. First, I love the Nuggets trading Michael Porter Jr . for veteran Cameron Johnson , who will provide them with spacing. MPJ was such a liability both defensively and in the postseason, and Johnson, despite being a league-average defender, is a significant upgrade. Denver also swapped Dario Saric for Jonas Valanciunas , which I also like, and signed both Bruce Brown and Tim Hardaway Jr . I believe this might be the best roster Denver's had during Nikola Jokic's tenure. Jokic is still the best player in the world and at the peak of his powers. The West is top-heavy, but I'd make Denver the favorite. Hawks to win Southeast Division (+150) Hawks Over 47.5 wins Hawks to win Eastern Conference (+1000): 0.25u These were two spots I hammered when these lines originally populated, and the numbers have adjusted. No team in the East looks to have improved more on paper than Atlanta. The Hawks added a trio of proven veterans in Kristaps Porzingis , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard . All three are guys who can give you solid minutes in the playoffs. The combination of Alexander-Walker and Dyson Daniels is going to give opposing backcourts fits. Don't forget Trae Young , Onyeka Okongwu , a healthy Jalen Johnson and last year's No. 1 overall pick, Zaccharie Risacher . If this team stays relatively healthy I expect the Hawks to blow past 48 wins and if some of their younger talent develops, we're looking at a darkhorse to win the East. Mavericks to make playoffs (+115) This is my largest position in the NBA futures market. Sure the Western Conference is loaded, but the Mavericks look extremely formidable, particularly defensively and I love their depth. No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg joins a veteran-laden roster led by a pair of top-20 players in Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving . The latter is still recovering from an ACL injury but is ahead of schedule and could return to the team by December. Dallas bolstered its backcourt by adding D'Angelo Russell and resigning Dante Exum , who has developed into a solid two-way player. The trio of Davis, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II are going to provide the Mavericks with elite rim protection. Naji Marshall , Max Christie , P.J. Washington and Klay Thompson are all guys who are capable two-way players and can give you solid minutes in the playoffs. I believe this team has a ceiling of 55-58 wins, and while Dallas may be a tier below Oklahoma City, Houston and Denver, the Mavericks should make the playoffs barring significant injuries. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

We're projecting each team", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. NBA offense by and large improves over time. A decade ago, the average NBA team scored 105.6 points per 100 possessions. Five years later, that figure increased to 110.6. Last season, it was 114.5. And yet, that wasn't the all-time high. In fact, we saw a 0.8 points per 100 possession decline leaguewide from the 2023-24 historic high of 115.3. The average NBA team posted a worse field goal percentage, 3-point percentage, free-throw rate and true shooting percentage than it did in the 2023-24 season. So this begs a question: Has NBA offense peaked? Have defenses finally caught on to the league's 3-point-heavy modern offenses? Well, no. This was actually a pretty natural balance to what we saw in the 2023-24 season, when league-wide offense dipped by nearly two points per 100 possessions after the All-Star break because the league began allowing defenses to play more physically. Some of those subtle rule changes persisted into last season, but offenses started to adjust to them. It's not as easy to score as it was two years ago, but offenses are learning how to navigate this new, more physical environment. There are a lot of ways in which they're doing that, but the most notable is their shot diet. Last season gave us the biggest year-over-over increase in average 3-point volume since 2019, as the average team took 2.5 more 3-pointers per game than it did in 2024. Of course, this isn't a catch-all solution to offensive problems. Denver took the fewest 3s in the league and ranked fourth on offense. The Knicks ranked 27th in 3-point attempts and fifth in offense. That's fairly encouraging for a league that drew plenty of criticism for its 3-point volume last season. Its proof that there's more than one way to skin the proverbial cat here. Take Houston's double-big alignment, perhaps the least-spaced lineup a contender used last season. It scored 125.7 points per 100 possession, according to Cleaning the Glass, which put it in the 98th percentile among all NBA lineup combinations. You can win shooting 3s. You can win in the mid-range, as the Knicks and Pacers so often did. You can win on the glass as the Rockets are trying to do. Keep this in mind as we rank all 30 NBA offenses. Talent is of course key, but don't sleep on intent. A team can go far by putting its players in the right places and taking advantage of the trends guiding its opposition. These rankings will attempt to encompass all conceivable factors, including likelihood of injury, expected lineup decisions and age-related improvement or decline. We are not ranking which offenses are the best in a vacuum. We are attempting to predict what the final offensive rating leaderboard will look like. With that in mind, let's dive in. The calculus here is relatively simple. Denver's offense is always great when Nikola Jokić is on the floor. In fact, in each of the past five seasons, they've scored more points per possession with Jokić on the court than that season's No. 1 offense posted for the entire year. The issue has always been with their bench, but the offseason additions of Jonas Valančiūnas, Tim Hardaway Jr . and Bruce Brown should meaningfully improve that bench before even considering the creation upgrade Cam Johnson brings over Michael Porter Jr . There's so much low-hanging fruit for new head coach David Adelman to pluck as well. The Nuggets ranked dead last in the NBA in 3-point attempts last season. If they can just creep closer to average, their offense should meaningfully improve from there. All of the ingredients for a No. 1 offense are here. Cleveland just had the second-best offensive regular season in NBA history. Losing Ty Jerome hurts, but he was somewhat duplicative of what their other guards already brought. Lonzo Ball injects some very helpful pace into the NBA 's seventh-slowest team from a year ago. They'll have De'Andre Hunter for the entire season, and Larry Nance Jr . offers a bit more front-court versatility than they had last season. Injuries are the risk here, but Kenny Atkinson's scheme fit this roster like a glove last season. Cleveland should have one of the NBA 's best offenses next year. The Knicks might have the most ways to beat an opponent of any offense in the NBA . Getting Mitchell Robinson back for double-big lineups should reinvigorate their offensive rebounding, an area in which they led the league comfortably during the 2023-24 season. Yet with Karl-Anthony Towns in place and Mike Brown seemingly more open-minded about lineups than Tom Thibodeau was, they can also comfortably play five-out looks with three shooters to maximize the Towns-Jalen Brunson pick-and-roll. Brunson is one of the best late-clock and late-game creators in the NBA , and the preseason returns have been pretty encouraging on Mike Brown's less rigid offense. Cleveland and New York also get the benefit of playing an Eastern Conference schedule, which should help them pad their numbers compared to their Western Conference counterparts. The Thunder have pretty much everything the Knicks do on offense, but in many cases their version is better. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won MVP last year, putting him a level above Brunson. Jalen Williams is a better wing creator than Mikal Bridges or OG Anunoby , though we'll see how his recovering wrist looks early in the season. Their double-big lineup with Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren thrived offensively thanks in large part to stellar offensive rebounding numbers. They never turn the ball over. That look will be back this year. The concerns here are pretty minor, but they exist. How healthy will Williams be early in the season? How much of an effort will they make to incorporate rookie Nikola Topić when he returns? How much harder is their West schedule compared to New York's and Cleveland's in the East? And how much do they really care about running up regular-season wins? They'll be somewhere near the top of the league, but with all of those things in mind, fourth feels like the appropriate compromise. Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now : They have skinny Luka Dončić. Everything starts there. In 2020 Dončić's Mavericks posted what was then the best offensive rating in NBA history with no other All-Stars on the team. He's that transformative of an individual shot-creator. Adding LeBron James and Austin Reaves is the icing on the cake. No team has more individual creation than the Lakers, and that insulates them against injuries like the one James is recovering from now. Yes, the Lakers were somewhat underwhelming offensively last season, but they were integrating Dončić midseason. Now they've had a full training camp to build around. He has a real offensive center in Deandre Ayton , and while he's not quite the lob threat Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively were, he's a vast overall improvement on the small-ball looks the Lakers relied on last year, especially if Ayton is motivated to prove himself in a contract year. There are some reasonable concerns here. Specifically, there's very little off-ball shooting in place here. Everyone wants to dribble. They won't always be able to. And of course, we don't know what James will look like in his age-41 season. But the Lakers were a candidate to rank No. 1 before the James injury dampened enthusiasm slightly. The post-Kevin Durant Warriors have been deceptively mortal offensively. They haven't ranked higher than ninth since he left, and were somehow 16th during the 2022 championship campaign. Much like the Nuggets, though, most of those issues arise when they don't have their best player. Golden State was 13.4 points per 100 possessions worse offensively without Stephen Curry last season, and in the past, even during the championship years, that figure has been bigger. You're making a meaningful bet on either a Jonthan Kuminga trade or Brandin Podziemski taking a step as a bench-unit creator here if you think the Warriors will rank this high, but obviously, that's what I'm doing. It helps that the Warriors should be a good deal better with their starters on the floor this season. Lineups featuring Curry and Jimmy Butler , which we only saw from February-April, ranked in the 88th percentile offensively last season, according to Cleaning the Glass. Al Horford unlocks so much for Golden State as a shooter, passer and screener. The Warriors are always deceptively strong on the glass, and only the Thunder scored more points off of turnovers last season. Both the Warriors and our next team are at risk of age-related decline, but they both look very strong on paper. Last season, the Clippers were pretty intentionally a defense-first team. Adding John Collins , Chris Paul and Bradley Beal will have defensive consequences, but the offense figures to take a leap with them in place. They were another high-end offense that struggled without their best players. The James Harden and Ivica Zubac-less minutes were mostly a mess for the Clippers, but bringing in Beal and Paul as bench creators and Brook Lopez as a legitimate, NBA-caliber backup center should help on that front. The hope here is that Kawhi Leonard plays more than the 37 games he participated in last season, though it's unclear what sort of mental toll the investigation into possible cap circumvention hanging over this team takes on them as the year progresses. The spacing will improve simply by virtue of playing Kris Dunn and Derrick Jones Jr . fewer minutes, though if that is indeed how this plays out, don't be surprised if the Clippers dip a bit as an offensive rebounding team. They were already bad on the front, and with less athleticism on the floor, they might prefer to devote even more resources to transition defense. Still, this team is deeper and more offensively inclined than it was a year ago, so expect a jump in the rankings if they stay healthy. From October through December of last season, the Timberwolves ranked 22nd in offense. From January through April, they ranked fifth, seemingly solving the fit issues that the Anthony Edwards-Julius Randle pairing presented early on. That required changes and growth all around the roster. Randle trimmed his mid-range frequency and turnover rate. Edwards took (and made) far more 3s than he ever had. It helped that Jaden McDaniels took a bit of a leap as well, averaging almost 15 points per game from February on by attacking the basket more aggressively than he ever has. It doesn't always look pretty. There's a concerning lack of playmaking here as Mike Conley ages, and the hope is that Edwards takes a step in that regard this season. But on a pretty simple level, if you win on the offensive glass and have a lot of players that can create their own shot, your offense is probably going to be pretty good. Few teams have a wider range of possible offensive outcomes than the Rockets. Let's say Amen Thompson grows into his higher-usage role, Alperen Sengun builds off of his stellar EuroBasket performance and Reed Sheppard is a 40% 3-point shooter on reasonable volume. Throw in the Kevin Durant addition and this could be a top-five offense. There's another plausible world in which the league adjusts to Houston's jumbo lineups and somehow manages to limit their behemoth offensive rebounding rate (36.3% last season, more than three percentage points higher than any other team, and 50.3% when Sengun and Steven Adams played together) while the young players struggle to fill Fred VanVleet 's shoes. In that scenario, the Rockets are below average. I lean slightly towards the former, but the caveat here is that Houston's margin for injury is very small. The shooting and individual creation will improve through Durant's presence alone, but Sheppard and Aaron Holiday are really the only traditionally guard-sized dribblers on the team. Durant and Sengun can certainly handle some creation responsibility, but the sheer lack of guards on the roster could make things difficult across and 82-game grind. Still, the roster is young and ready to improve, and Durant will open up so much that it seems reasonably safe to assume that someone between Sheppard, Thompson and Sengun can pick up enough of VanVleet's ball-handling to keep this offense afloat. For years the Hawks were good on offense and bad on defense. They attempted to rectify that by grabbing every big wing they could find. They've had success on that front, but those same big wings have largely been iffy shooters. The trio of Dyson Daniels , Zaccharie Risacher and Jalen Johnson made around 34% of their 3s last season, so the Hawks addressed that by grabbing a great shooting center (Kristaps Porziņģis) and two shooting wings ( Luke Kennard and Nickeil Alexander-Walker ). Now, Atlanta has achieved balance. It's still going to be a Trae Young pick-and-roll fest, but one in which the Hawks can more comfortably mix and match lineups to find the right combinations. When they need more shooting, Porziņģis addresses it. When they have enough on the perimeter, they can spread out around Young and the bouncier Onyeka Okongwu . Those big wings are all capable ball-handlers, which not only eases the bench issues the Hawks have always had, but gives Atlanta more optionality offensively. They don't have to be the Young show on every possession, and that extra ball-handling helped them get to the line quite a bit last season. Health is a risk between Johnson and Porziņģis, but this is a deep and versatile enough group to handle some injuries. Playing Giannis Antetokounmpo at point guard with four shooters around him is a pretty straightforward offensive formula. It was obviously a small sample, but point-Giannis lineups after Damian Lillard 's blood clot last year posted a 127 offensive rating in 385 minutes. Myles Turner is a big offensive upgrade over Brook Lopez. Kevin Porter Jr. was good for them after his deadline acquisition, and Cole Anthony was a solid get for the minimum. As much as they'll miss Lillard's individual scoring, the offense as a whole, with Giannis, is going to work. But during that same 11-game stretch without Lillard, Milwaukee's offense dipped by almost 15 points per 100 possessions whenever Giannis sat. That's the issue here. How much rest can the Bucks get away with giving him? What happens if he misses two or three weeks with an ankle sprain? Remember, over the past seven seasons, he has always missed between nine and 19 games. There's a real chance the offense craters when he does. There isn't another starting-caliber shot-creator on this roster. Doc Rivers teams never get offensive rebounds, nor are they especially creative. The Bucks ranked in the bottom-10 in both passes per game and average distance traveled on offense, per NBA.com tracking data. Both numbers are iffy without context, but they just go to show how much the Bucks rely on Antetokounmpo to generate their offense. It should be good when he's playing and bad when he isn't, so this really comes down to how much of him we see this season. Count me as the last person on the internet that still has some faith in Joel Embiid . Last season was an unmitigated disaster. The year before that he averaged more points than minutes, and before that he won MVP. There is a middle ground between those extremes, and there is so much perimeter talent here that it would take another onslaught of injuries to slow this offense down completely. Jared McCain got Rookie of the Year votes despite playing in 23 games, and he's still the fourth guard on this depth chart. Paul George has become an afterthought. Even amid last year's mess, they still took the right shots, ranking sixth in free-throw rate, eighth in percentage of shots within three feet of the rim and 13th in 3-point attempt rate. Nobody's saying Embiid has another MVP in him. But unless he's once again limited to 15 or 20 underwhelming games and the rest of the firepower here is similarly hampered, this offense is going to be pretty good. The Magic have had a bottom-10 offense 13 years in a row. There is literally not an active member of the Magic that has played for or against a league-average Magic offense. This is the year that changes. Jalen Suggs ' health is a concern here. Despite his inconsistent shooting, his playmaking on both sides of the ball is an important source of offense. But you don't give up four first-round picks for a player without expecting an immediate impact. Desmond Bane 's elite shooting will go a long way for an offense that ranked last by a mile in 3-point percentage a year ago. His secondary playmaking helps as well, and adding Tyus Jones gives them a more traditional point guard when one is needed. Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero both took meaningful steps last season, and even despite the poor shooting and injuries, the Magic had the NBA 's second-best free-throw rate and sixth-most points per game off of turnovers last season. They won't be a great shooting team, but they get to the line, get to the basket and generate points off of turnovers through their elite defense. So long as the shooting is reasonable, the offense is going to improve. The Pistons didn't really excel in any one area offensively. They didn't crack the top 10 in free-throw rate, 3-point attempt rate, 3-point percentage, rim rate or offensive rebounding. They ranged from pretty good to below-average in basically everything, and it came together to form a passable offense because Cade Cunningham was good enough to lift an otherwise defensively-inclined roster. He'll do the same this season, but there are roster questions beyond him. Can they properly space the floor with Amen Thompson playing in a perimeter slot? Can the returning Jaden Ivey match the secondary ball-handling Schröder brought after the deadline? Can he maintain his encouraging shooting improvement from before his injury? There's certainly room for growth here. The roster is young and the offseason tweaks made sense in light of the complicated Malik Beasley situation. They're counting on Duncan Robinson to match the remarkable shooting season Beasley just had, but he's no slouch himself. Ultimately, your perception of the Detroit offense will come down to how you rate Cunningham. At the level he played last season, it's hard to see Detroit slipping further than this. I don't know what to do with Boston. There's a world in which a couple of ankle sprains in November and December create an impromptu tank. There's a world in which Boston's overall offensive structure is so sound that they land in the top 10 even without Jayson Tatum . They were the first team in NBA history to take more 3s than 2s last season. Expect them to become the first team to ever shoot 50 3s per game this year. Only the Thunder turn the ball over less than the do. They also never get to the rim or the free-throw line. Maybe they still have enough shooting to thrive in that structure. Payton Pritchard and Anfernee Simons have obvious deficiencies defensively, but they can certainly shoot, and if they make 3s at anything resembling the rate they have in the past, maybe they can make up for their talent deficit by giving the unheralded big men who will play this season (notably Neemias Queta ) more chances to score as a roller against defenses that are stretched thin. The middle feels like an appropriate compromise, but they could really go either way. Does the roster make much sense? No. They needed a point guard following the De'Aaron Fox trade, but in Dennis Schröder, they got less of a playmaker and more of an individual creator, and in Russell Westbrook they got, well, Russell Westbrook. The back court is crowded with Schröder, Westbrook, Malik Monk , Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan all used to having the ball more than they'll be able to here. Speaking of which, will Keegan Murray ever get the on-ball reps he needs to take the next step? He'll miss the beginning of the season due to a UCL tear. But truthfully, this is just the floor for the amount of talent the Kings have on offense. If you have Domantas Sabonis , some shooting and a bunch of players who can create their own shots, you're going to score points. You'd hope for better shot-selection here, as the Kings neither shot enough 3s nor drew enough fouls last season, but at least they never turn the ball over. They'll brute force their way to a decent offense, but considering they ranked seventh last season, they could be a good deal better if not for these front office own goals. The Spurs are banking a lot offensively on Victor Wembanyama 's shooting, because their three primary guards ( Stephon Castle , De'Aaron Fox and Dylan Harper ) range from iffy to nonexistent shooters. Rookie Carter Bryant has a long way to go as a shooter as well, so space is going to be at a premium. But there is just so much creation here. Wembanyama looks so much more confident with the ball now than he did a year or two ago, and the strength that's added will only make him more imposing. The guards can get to the rim, and they'll love throwing Wembanyama lobs. Ultimately, at least for now, the whole is probably going to be less than the sum of its parts. As this group figures out its identity and grows, that will likely change. But they badly need more shooting before they can be an above-average offense. This is the weirdest offense in the NBA . D'Angelo Russell is the only proven guard here. Cooper Flagg has flashed point guard skills. Jason Kidd loves empowering young stars as ball-handlers, with Giannis Antetokounmpo being the primary example. But that's much more of a developmental tactic than a winning one. It is just exceedingly rare that a rookie can be the primary ball-handler on a good offense even if his individual numbers are good. When Luka Dončić won Rookie of the Year, he ranked 20th. Looking for such a player on a decent team? A year later, Ja Morant 's Grizzlies ranked 21st despite reaching the Play-In. Flagg has MVP potential. It probably isn't going to lead to great team offense in Year 1, especially with the iffy shooting that will come out of double-big lineups. Those units are probably going to have to rebound at close to the level that Houston has with its double-big look to survive, except no Jason Kidd-led Mavericks team has ever ranked higher than 23rd in offensive rebounding. Some of that is personnel. Some of it is preference. His teams tend to focus more on transition defense. What sort of concessions will Dallas be willing to make defensively in the name of offense? Because Russell and Klay Thompson is simultaneously the only viable offensive backcourt and explicitly not a viable defensive one, as Russell has always been a poor defender and Thompson, at this point, can really only defend bigger forwards. This roster is just too unbalanced in its current condition, and if Davis suffers any of his frequent injuries, they lose the talent surplus they think will get them through this. Could Kyrie Irving address some of these issues? Sure. We just have no idea when or if he'll return. If there's going to be a surprise team to emerge with a top-10 offense, it would be the Bulls. They were 17-10 after the All-Star break, including a blistering period in March that came against a Charmin-soft schedule. While they lack the obvious star power that teams above them have, they do have a distinct style that matches their talent. They're the fastest team in the NBA and they hoist a billion 3s. It's straightforward, mathematically sound and fun to watch. Now, can you trust Josh Giddey to create a good shot late in a high-leverage game? Probably not. He still has a ways to go off of the ball even with last year's shooting growth. But if you just need someone to generate night-to-night regular-season offense? He's your man, and removing Zach LaVine from the equation also empowered Coby White , who averaged almost 28 points per game in March. Toss in a possible Year 2 leap for Matas Buzelis and you've got an offense that's light on star power but reasonably high on upside. Shooting guards and centers. That's it. Even the players who aren't centers or shooting guards are spiritually centers or shooting guards. Dillon Brooks has the heart of a chucker. If Ryan Dunn 's shooting doesn't improve, opposing teams will guard him with a center. Now, fortunately, those shooting guards and centers are reasonably good shooting guards and centers. Devin Booker is a star. Grayson Allen has led the NBA in 3-point percentage. Jalen Green is still a very athletic No. 2 overall pick despite getting dumped by Houston. Mark Williams is a killer offensive center when he's healthy. There's talent here, and it's not entirely devoid of skill diversity. But there's just not enough playmaking here or reliability in the front court to assume the offense as a whole is actually going to be, well, good. It'll have good nights and stretches, but it's just not clear yet how all of these overlapping pieces are going to actually function together. Throw out basically everything that happened last year. They changed the scheme completely, adopting a revolutionary offense devoid of pick-and-roll. It worked until it didn't. Coaches got fired as a result. Now we're back to something a bit more ordinary, and that's disappointing, because the Grizzlies right now don't really have the personnel to execute \"ordinary.\" Ja Morant is too unreliable from a health perspective. They were wise to go out and add a second high-level bench creator in Ty Jerome, but he comes with plenty of his own risks. The entire front court is hurt at the moment, so we can't say with much certainty that they'll be able to maintain the offensive rebounding that has been their trademark in recent years. Oh, and Desmond Bane is gone. This is a transitional year for Memphis. A lot of it will be spent rediscovering an offensive identity it can keep moving forward. The Raptors been near the top of the league in passes per game in both years under Darko Rajaković, and they're a strong offensive rebounding team. They never take 3s, but they've never really had the players to take many 3s. Will that change this season? Brandon Ingram tends to take six or seven 3s per game when he's playing for a contract and three or four when he isn't. Would they bench RJ Barrett for Gradey Dick to improve their spacing? Scottie Barnes regressing on that front is a big blow. There's the danger of a cap dump here, as the Raptors are somehow over the luxury tax for this weird mishmash of a roster. Health is always a concern as well, or at least has been in recent years, and their last few notable draft picks ( Collin Murray-Boyles and Jamal Shead ) are much more defensively-inclined. There's enough talent here to survive, but it's hard to imagine too much more than that. Indiana is far likelier than Boston to pivot into a gap-year tank. Boston's offensive identity is schematic. Indiana's was based on a single player, Tyrese Haliburton , who is out. You could even argue they lost their second-most important offensive player purely from a schematic perspective in Myles Turner because of how rare it is to find centers who can shoot and score inside. They're going to have to reinvent themselves completely for a single year. Andrew Nembhard is an awesome supporting piece, but there just isn't real evidence that he can be a primary point guard on a good offense. Heck, even his scoring is a bit suspect. Compare his regular-season and playoff shooting numbers. The difference is jarring. Bennedict Mathurin is playing for a contract. The Pacers will give him chances to post numbers, and Rick Carlisle is a genius. He'll find ways to make the most of what he has. He just has so much less than he did a year ago that it seems likelier that they ultimately accept defeat on a lost season. There are two different conversations we need to have here. There's the first one that covers what the team looks like healthy, because hey, skinny Zion Williamson , that's potentially interesting. Except for the fact that this team is still sorely short on shooters. None of the centers shoot. Herb Jones is only intermittently guarded on the perimeter. Jeremiah Fears is a work in progress. How much will Jordan Hawkins get to play? His role has fluctuated quite a bit across his first two seasons. It's going to be hard to take advantage of even the best version of Williamson with this kind of spacing. For now, the only reliable shooters we can trust to play major minutes are Jordan Poole and Trey Murphy. And then there's the other conversation we need to have about the Pelicans, the one we have every year, where we get to December and half of the team is hurt and it's just an all-around bummer. It's a shame, too. Williamson was quietly great down the stretch last season. Trey Murphy is growing into a star. There's talent here. It's just a dangerous combination of unlucky and incompatible. There are actually things to like in Portland. They're a great offensive rebounding team thanks to Donovan Clingan . They have a lot of high-IQ supporting pieces. Deni Avdija took a meaningful step last season. But who's driving the bus here? Not Scoot Henderson , who will miss the beginning of the season and presumably have to earn his minutes from there. Could it be Shaedon Sharpe ? He's had an impressive training camp by all accounts and has star-caliber tools. But we just don't know who the engine is going to be. There are a lot of good role players and no obvious high-usage scorer. If one of the younger players pops, the Blazers have more offensive potential than this. But we've been saying that for a few years now. Someone needs to prove it before they can climb up lists like this. There was a disturbing lifelessness from the Heat offensively, especially late in games. They ranked 27th in fourth-quarter offense, and they got progressively worst as the year dragged on. The Jimmy Butler drama was obviously a component of those struggles, but he also highlighted problems that had been growing for years. This equal-opportunity offense requires a level of shooting and overall talent that the Heat just don't have anymore. Tyler Herro making the All-Star Game was nice, but it was in the East, and nobody would mistake him for a traditional star guard. He's at his best working off of another high-level scorer, as Butler was. With Herro out early in the season and rumors of a schematic reinvention swirling, the Heat have an uphill climb ahead of them on offense. LaMelo Ball is rarely healthy. Brandon Miller missed most of last year. They still don't really have a center, and while that's going to manifest more noticeably on defense, it matters offensively as well. It's not like the Hornets have the personnel to play small and win solely on the basis of shooting. It's their second year under Charles Lee. The hope here is that they can successfully adopt a more definable system and take a meaningful step towards at least respectability. But when you're never healthy, never get to the line and now that Mark Williams is gone, will probably never get offensive rebounds either, the path to being a good offense just gets so narrow. There are only so many crazy shots Ball can make. Kon Knueppel will help, but it feels like they're at least another year away. Does anyone believe Lauri Markkanen will still be on the team in February? If the answer is no, the only other player on the team who averaged at least 12 points per game is Keyonte George , who did so shooting 39.1% from the field. They're tanking. When you're tanking, you rid yourself of valuable players. Some of the young guys will grow. Ace Bailey has looked very promising in the preseason. But this team is built to lose and that is what it will do. Give Will Hardy some credit. The Jazz somehow ranked seventh in free-throw rate and 3-point attempt rate and sixth in offensive rebounding rate last season. They're well-coached enough to do the right things. They just don't have the players yet to do those things at a high enough level to actually win. The Nets will enter the season with only seven players on their roster with at least four years of experience. That means at least half of their roster will essentially be comprised of players either literally on rookie contracts or at least in that age range. Nobody on this roster averaged four assists per game in the NBA last season, and the team leader, Cam Thomas , averaged less than one pass per minute as recently as the 2023-24 season despite ostensibly being a point guard (or at least having the ball as often as one does). These passing numbers seem notable as their highest-paid player is Michael Porter Jr., who is used to shooting off of passes from Nikola Jokić. At least the Nets are properly committed to the tank this year. They have CJ McCollum . Corey Kispert is a good shooter. That's about all I've got here. Khris Middleton is never healthy. The young players are all projects picked mostly for athletic traits that have shown promise, but haven't yet grown into steady production. They ranked 29th in 3-point percentage, never got to the line, turned the ball over constantly and were a below-average offensive rebounding team. Keep an eye on the individual development of those recent draft picks. As a group, the Wizards still have a ways to go. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Being a franchise player can be tricky business -- for the player and the NBA franchise. Finding the proper match where the union is solid and neither side has a wandering eye can be complicated. Ahead of his 11th season, Nikola Jokić recently said \"my plan is to be a Nugget forever.\" That represents the best-case scenario in a fickle business -- two sides that can't imagine being without each other. Somewhat less ideal is what unfolded during Bucks media day, when managing governor Wes Edens said he had a conversation with Giannis Antetokounmpo this offseason in which his franchise player expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. When asked about it shortly thereafter Giannis replied \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Ouch. When it comes to franchise players, it's not just about the player's talent but also the fit with his team. Less than a year ago everyone figured Luka Dončić would be a Forever Maverick and one day get a statue outside American Airlines Center in Dallas just like Dirk Nowitzki before him. Now Luka plays for the Lakers . The Franchise Player Tiers that follow try to keep all that in mind: How good is the player and what kind of situation is he in for the short and long-term? And in some cases, as we go lower down the list, are the players in question actually franchise-level talents or do their teams just want to squint at them hard enough to convince themselves? No surprises here. Each of these guys finished in the top five of our Top 100 list heading into this season. Jokic has won three of the last five MVPs -- and likely could have had more if not for voter fatigue -- and remains one of the betting favorites along with SGA to reclaim that particular piece of hardware. He bootstrapped a not-nearly-as-deep Nuggets team into forcing Game 7 in the second round of the playoffs against the eventual champion Thunder. And in the annual general manager survey conducted by NBA.com , Joker -- who is listed by the league at 6-foot-11, 284 pounds -- was also the overwhelming choice as the NBA 's best passer and highest basketball IQ. Because he does stuff like this: SGA is coming off a banner season where he delivered Oklahoma City's first championship parade. In the process he became just the fourth player in NBA history to lead the league in scoring while winning MVP and Finals MVP, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. Then he signed a monster four-year, $285 million extension in July. Who's doing it better than that guy? (Rhetorical.) Luka made five straight first-team All-NBA selections before that run was temporarily halted last season due to nagging injuries that kept him below the 65-game threshold required to qualify. He was also the center of the most shocking trade in recent memory (or ever) when he was shipped to the Lakers in a deal that will haunt Mavs fans -- and by extension Dallas GM Nico Harrison -- forever. Dončić is still only 26, and now we'll see what kind of havoc he unleashes on the league with his new slimmed-down revenge body . Wembanyama was already tall, but apparently he grew again? The Spurs are now listing him at 7-feet-4. Feels like that shouldn't be allowed, especially given his already outsized skillset. Last season, he became just the second player in NBA history to record a line of 25+ points, 5+ rebounds, 5+ assists, 5+ steals and 5+ blocks in multiple games. The other guy is Hakeem Olajuwon. That's good company. Unfortunately for Wembanyama, his second season was cut short when he was shut down after just 46 games due to deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. Despite that, he still led the league with 176 blocks -- which was 28 more than Brook Lopez , who finished second in that category and played 80 games, and 63 more than Evan Mobley , who won Defensive Player of the Year. Wembanyama is only 21. This is a superhero origin story where he's still learning what his abilities are. The rest of the league is in so much trouble when he figures out how to fully use his powers. If it was only about talent, Giannis would be safely ensconced in Tier 1, and he and the Bucks would be happily married forever. Alas, there are other factors here, namely how long he will remain in Milwaukee. When determining franchise players, it helps to know which franchise he might be employed by -- not just right now but moving forward. Antetokounmpo recently said that he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season but reserves the right to change his mind in \"six, seven months.\" That not-so-muffled scream you hear is coming from Bucks fans who will have to deal with this topic for the foreseeable future. The Bucks decided to waive-and-stretch Damian Lillard this offseason, a short-term patch that allowed them to poach Myles Turner from the Indiana Pacers in a desperate attempt to stay relevant and appease Giannis. (Elsewhere on the desperation and appeasement front: The Bucks signed two of Giannis's brothers, Thanasis and Alex. We're maybe one more probing Knicks call from distant cousins and aunties getting on Milwaukee's payroll.) Stretching Lillard will cost the Bucks $22.5 million per season over the next five years, severely hampering their team building options. Giannis has already said he wants to win another championship. He'll be 31 in December. Even in a weakened Eastern Conference, can the Bucks realistically offer him that opportunity anytime soon? Put another way, who's the third best player on that team after Giannis and Turner? Is it Bobby Portis ? Kyle Kuzma ? AJ Green ? Whatever the answer, it's not great. There's a reason why the Knicks reportedly looked into acquiring Giannis this offseason. There are 29 other teams watching this with great interest and waiting for him to ask out so they can potentially pounce. As for Steph, the greatest shooter of all time isn't going anywhere, and the Warriors have high hopes for a full season of him paired with Jimmy Butler , longtime running mate Draymond Green and new center Al Horford . Unfortunately, time comes for all of us. This will be Curry's 17th season, and he turns 38 in March. There's an argument to be made that how much time he has left should outweigh time already served, that younger players with their whole careers ahead of them (like the guys in Tier 5) should be higher than someone who has most of his in the rearview. You could certainly make that argument -- but I won't. What he has behind him is a whole lot more than most players will ever muster, and that counts for quite a bit. And oh yeah, he still made second-team All-NBA last year . He's not done yet. Big news, NBA fans.

Ant previously said he doesn't want to be the face of the league, but since he's become the face of the Wolves he's helped pick up a franchise that was down bad for a while. The man took the Wolves to back-to-back Western Conference finals, has played more than 72 games in each of his first five seasons, and is generally a delight whether he's throwing down monster dunks, leading the league in 3-pointers made as he did a year ago, or entertaining us (well maybe not Lakers fans) with a little postseason walk-and-trash talk . Cade Cunningham made his first All-NBA selection last season. In the process, he took the Pistons from the worst team in the league two seasons ago when they won just 14 games to a 44-win team that claimed the six seed in the Eastern Conference, making Detroit the first team in NBA history to triple its win total year over year. The last seven MVPs have all been foreign-born players. The last time someone from the states took home the hardware was James Harden back in 2018. If you were betting on the next American to win the award, look no further than one of these two. Maybe this group doesn't have the same Q rating as the players ahead of them but their teams are in good shape with them leading the way. Jalen Brunson finished in the top five of the MVP voting two seasons ago, has made two straight All-NBA teams, and helped the Knicks reach the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years. Donovan Mitchell finished fifth in MVP voting last season, made first team All-NBA and was a key reason why the Cavaliers had their best season (non-LeBron division) in recent memory. And Paolo Banchero got a five-year $239 million max extension and has a lot of people -- hi, it's me, I am \"a lot of people\" in this context -- eyeing the Magic as a make-the-leap team this season. Oof. Both suffered Achilles tears during the postseason, impacting not just the playoffs but the offseason approach for both organizations. The Celtics moved on from Jrue Holiday , Kristaps Porzingis , Al Horford and Luke Kornet among others in order to avoid paying around half a billion dollars (!) for a roster that likely won't have Tatum this season -- even though he recently posted a video of himself dunking mere months removed from his surgery. Must be the shoes 👀🔥 pic.twitter.com/SQsxrWDAkX Haliburton had a spectacular postseason run and looked great to start Game 7 against the Thunder in the Finals before suffering the injury that everyone feared. That gave the typically financially conservative Pacers the cover they needed to let Myles Turner walk this offseason with the evident thought process being something approaching \"why pay more for a team that can't win anything significant until Haliburton is back when you can just go get Jay Huff ?\" I like Jay Huff by the way. Hi Jay if you're reading this (and even if you're not). Even so, that is a tough turn of events for Pacers fans. The Mavericks had a 1.8% chance to land the top pick in the draft and one of the most-hyped prospects of the last two decades. Losing Luka was a blow Mavs fans might never recover from, but pulling a hyper-talented multi-positional rabbit out of the super-long-odds lottery hat is not too bad as consolation prizes go. Flagg can impact the game at both ends of the floor, and with Kyrie Irving still recovering from an ACL injury, we might get a healthy dose of Point Cooper early on this season to supplement D'Angelo Russell . The Rockets are the only team in this exercise with two players listed (other than the Heat , but that's a different situation). This is sort of a choose-your-own adventure situation where there are no wrong answers on which one could become the face of the franchise. Sengun came in six spots higher in our Top 100 and made the All-Star team last season, while Thompson was selected as the most athletic player, the most versatile defender, and the most likely to have a breakout season in the NBA.com GM survey. For my money, I'm going with Thompson. I mean, just look at this . Just watch how fast Amen Thompson accelerates pic.twitter.com/ORSMu9yjVh There's a reason why everyone from LeBron James to Steve Kerr to De'Aaron Fox has openly gushed about Thompson's athleticism. This is the tier where questions start popping up and you wonder if the franchise player can provide the proper answers. Booker signed a two-year $145 million extension this offseason that the Suns rushed to give him even though they could (and should) have waited. Owner Mat Ishbia has called him the franchise player, indicated multiple times he's not going anywhere, and also said that he and Booker are \"aligned\" on the Suns future. The Suns won 36 games a season ago and missed the playoffs when Kevin Durant was in uniform alongside Booker. KD now plays in Houston. Color me skeptical that it will go better for Booker and the Suns in a loaded Western Conference when he's now paired with another high-usage, high-volume (and far more inefficient) shooter in Jalen Green . Since Kawhi left Toronto for L.A., the Clippers have gotten out of the second round once and have been a first-round exit in each of the last three postseasons. Part of struggle has been his injury history, but he was healthy for last year's playoffs and the Clips still got bounced in seven games by the Nuggets. Then there's the investigation into questions about an alleged no-show endorsement deal hovering over him and the team that don't figure to go anywhere anytime soon. The Clippers are deep and talented -- but even with Kawhi, they're still the Clippers. This tier is the Island of Misfit Toys and Broken Dreams. Joel Embiid is a former MVP who has missed close to half the games in his career due to a variety of injuries and has never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Zion Williamson has played 30 or fewer games in four of his six NBA seasons, including last year. Ja Morant has never played more than 67 games in a single season, and appeared in a total of 59 games over the last two seasons combined. And unlike Embiid and Williamson, I'm not convinced that Morant -- who, it should be stipulated, is as athletic and enjoyable to watch as anyone in the NBA when healthy -- is even the best player on his own team when that team also employs two-way star Jaren Jackson Jr . What are we even doing here? This is the hang your head in your hands tier. Trae Young is still waiting and hoping for the Hawks to offer him the four-year $229 million extension he's eligible to sign. If you're made to wait and wonder about that kind of thing, it's generally a sign that you're not really the franchise player. (Related: put me down for Jalen Johnson actually being the best player on the Hawks.) Same goes for Josh Giddey, who had to haggle with the Bulls over his latest deal during restricted free agency before landing on an average annual value of $25 million over four years. Good work if you can get it, but not truly a franchise player. After Miami bundled Jimmy Butler off to the Bay, it felt like the leading man role was being transferred to Tyler Herro by default, but if you prefer Bam Adebayo as the star avatar here that's fine. Either way, the Heat got dusted in a four-game sweep by the Cavs last postseason. Not a great result for whoever wants to own that. Adebayo shot just 43.8% from the field in that series and was minus-73 over four games. Herro was even worse. He hit just 41.5% of his shots and was minus-87. Yikes all the way around. The Raptors would love for Scottie Barnes to make them a thing. So far, he hasn't and they're not. Even in a weak Eastern Conference, is Barnes good enough to make them anything more than a back-end playoff team? I'm skeptical. And LaMelo Ball -- the living embodiment of the classic no-no-yes chaos agent with the mayhem dials cranked up as far as they will possibly go -- came in at No. 53 in our Top 100. Do not blame me for that. I was the lowest on him of all our voters at No. 76. I still think I might have had him too high. He tossed up a YOLO catch-and-shoot fadeaway 3 the other day that made exactly no sense to anyone in the building except him; it was preseason, but the man is already in midseason form. You will notice that the Nets , Wizards , Kings , Jazz and Blazers have no one listed here. Some of them are better positioned than others going forward. The Blazers have good pieces, if not anyone who fits into a franchise or even star context. And I wouldn't bet against the Jazz figuring things out over the long haul when they have not one but two Ainges in charge. Even so, all of them should consider some sort of blood sacrifice to curry favor with the Basketball Gods, or at the very least burn some sage. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Dwyane Wade is one of the best basketball players of the last 25 years. In fact, he ranked 11th in our CBS Sports' top 25 players of the 21st century. He's a three-time champion, 13-time All-Star first-ballot Hall of Famer and a member of the NBA's 75th anniversary team. And that's just a small snapshot of his accolades. He's six years removed from throwing on his iconic No. 3 jersey and has since started a career as a basketball analyst, both in the podcast space and on television. As he prepares for his new gig as a member of NBA on Amazon Prime's broadcast crew, Wade shared when he knew it was time to retire. \"Once I knew that I didn't have that special quality anymore, that I lost all my powers and I became a regular basketball player, the game was not as fun as it used to be,\" Wade told GQ . Wade spent 14 years of his 16-year career operating at peak levels. Even at 35-years old, he was still averaging 18.3 points a game, something only seven other players have accomplished since 2000. But those last two seasons saw a downturn in production from one of the league's most efficient scorers when he was in his prime. It's a situation most professional athletes go through when they're reaching their twilight years. Perhaps the only two people it hasn't impacted are LeBron James and Tom Brady, two titans who have defied father time. Brady played until he was 45 and won a Super Bowl at 43. James is about to turn 41 in December and is still operating at All-NBA levels. While James is set to miss his first season opener in his record-breaking 23rd season due to sciatica, there still isn't a more feared image for opponents than James driving full speed into the lane with the objective of finishing at the rim when healthy. Wade was once that way, too. He wasn't quite the physical specimen James is, but his quickness and athleticism made him one of the most difficult players to guard. \"When you had the career I had, you don't envy someone else's journey,\" Wade said. \"I got everything out of the game of basketball that I possibly wanted.\" Wade wasn't just one of the best players in the league, he was one of the most popular, too. His talent transcended the Miami Heat fanbase, so it wasn't uncommon to see No. 3 Wade jerseys overflowing at away arenas whenever he and the Heat came to town. Fans chanting his name -- or booing him -- is a feeling that can't be replicated outside of the NBA, and while he likely doesn't miss back-to-back games, or the grind of an 82-game regular season, there is one thing the Hall of Famer misses. \"What I do miss is being better than people,\" Wade said. \"I miss being good at something, really good at it.\" © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . After laying an egg (pun intended) in the first two games of the ALCS at home, the Blue Jays needed to show signs of life in Game 3. Well, their vital signs look just fine from where I'm sitting. After falling behind 2-0 in the bottom of the first, Toronto's bats woke up, and the team smacked the cover off the ball. Five different players -- George Springer , Vladimir Guerrero Jr. , Alejandro Kirk , Addison Barger and Andres Gimenez -- hit home runs as the Blue Jays ran away with a 13-4 win to make it a 2-1 series. What was the key to the Jays' offensive resurgence ? As Mike Axisa explains, it was their ability to jump all over Mariners starter George Kirby 's fastball. The best job in America, maybe the world, is a fired college football coach. No one gets paid more (millions) to do less (nothing), and the price tags have skyrocketed in recent years. Less than one year after taking Penn State to the College Football Playoff, James Franklin was shown the door on the heels of consecutive losses to Oregon , UCLA and Northwestern . On his way out the door, Franklin will cash a $49 million check, the second-largest buyout in college football history. Our own Brandon Marcello took a deep dive to find out what's behind these ballooning contracts and buyouts in college football. Sometimes, these gargantuan deals stem from one thing: Fear. The higher-ups at these schools are scared to miss out on -- or lose -- the hottest names in the sport. As the money continues to explode ( nine coaches are set to make at least $10 million in 2025), here are the biggest buyouts in college football today: 1. Kirby Smart , Georgia ($105.1 million) 2. Lincoln Riley , USC ($80+ million) 3. Ryan Day , Ohio State ($70.9 million) 4. Mario Cristobal , Miami ($61 million) 5. Kalen DeBoer , Alabama ($60.8 million) Most of those coaches are relatively safe at their current gigs, but these nine coaches are feeling the heat . At least the severance packages will be quite generous. Our NBA Top 100 players list was released on Tuesday, but we have another list that's just as interesting. Adam Finkelstein captured a snapshot of the league's future in his 25 under 25 ranking . It's hard to beat the combination of youth and skill, especially when it means cheaper contracts in the present and a bright future down the road. Every player on this list has both of those, and one of them already has a ring. Mentioned in the same ballpark as Victor Wembanyama and Anthony Edwards , Thunder star Jalen Williams comes in at No. 6 after helping Oklahoma City win its first NBA title. His ability to accept a role and play it to the best of his ability is invaluable, according to Adam Finkelstein. Here's a little taste of the top 10 -- that's called a tease, folks. 6.

A highly anticipated 2025-26 NBA season tips off Tuesday, and the league might revolve around the usually football-crazy Southwestern USA because there are major story lines in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio as well as the defending league champions and reigning MVP playing in Oklahoma City. The Western Conference looks miles better than the East with the likes of superstars Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton expected to miss this season. Milwaukee tried to stay competitive sans Damian Lillard by eating the remaining $113 million of his deal via waivers and signing Myles Turner. Giannis Antetokounmpo will have to play at an MVP level for the Bucks to hang in the East provided he's not traded. Lillard returned to Portland but won't play this year. Incidentally, the past seven NBA MVP winners have been born outside the United States: Greece's Antetokounmpo (twice), Serbia's Nikola Jokic (thrice), Cameroon's Joel Embiid and then Canada's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Thunder last season. I find an American to be the best value this year; James Harden in 2018 (Houston version) was the last USA winner. If you are into collectibles, there is something new in the Association this season as Fanatics/Topps is bringing its patch and gold logo patch programs per ESPN. Reportedly, all rookies will wear an NBA debut patch on his uniform that will be removed after play and put onto an autographed, numbered rookie card. Last season's MVP (Gilgeous-Alexander), Rookie of the Year (San Antonio's Stephon Castle) and Defensive Player of the Year (Cleveland's Evan Mobley) will have a Gold NBA Logoman patch placed on their uniforms, which will be removed after play and inserted into rare trading cards. I have picks for all those awards this year but subbed in Most Improved Player for Defensive Player of the Year because the Spurs' Victor Wembanyama (-180) seems all but a sure thing to win it if he doesn't get hurt again. The 7-foot-4 shot-blocking demon was the runaway favorite for DPOY at last season's All-Star break but wasn't able to play after due to deep vein thrombosis. The 2023 first overall pick is good go to for his team's opener in Dallas next Wednesday. That's must-see TV with Wemby vs. Flagg. I certainly don't rule out Gilgeous-Alexander but like Heisman Trophy winners, NBA MVPs generally have to exceed their previous season's numbers to repeat and I'm not sure SGA can do better than 32.7 points per game on 51.9% shooting from the field, 6.4 assists per game and 5.0 rebounds per game. I do quite like Antetokounmpo to have a big season and he's pretty good value at +1100. But the Bucks might not be very good -- and as noted, Antetokounmpo might be traded. Because I like the Knicks to win the watered-down East, why not take Brunson at this terrific number? He just led New York to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000. Playing more games against a watered-down East while MVP contenders in the West have to face much tougher competition can only help Brunson's cause. Voters already love him as Brunson won the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year for 2024-25. And that was while he was playing under a defensive-minded head coach in Tom Thibodeau. New head coach Mike Brown should bring in some modern offensive concepts to put Brunson in position to be even more efficient. This price is obviously too short for much value, but Flagg is such a cut above the rest of the rookie class. The only way he doesn't win is if the No. 1 overall pick misses a ton of games with an injury. Note that players aren't required to play 65 regular-season games to be eligible for Rookie of the Year, unlike other major awards. I'm just not sure I see another rookie who will contribute as much to a potentially good team. The No. 1 overall pick won ROY in 2023 (Orlando's Paolo Banchero ) and in 2024 (San Antonio's Wembanyama), but it went to No. 4 overall pick Castle of the Spurs last year. While a handful of clubs have had back-to-back Rookies of the Year, no team has had three in a row. San Antonio's Dylan Harper , the No. 2 overall pick this year, is +1000. But he won't even start most games as a rookie with De'Aaron Fox and Castle in the backcourt. Harper is raw, while Flagg is much more polished. This recommendation is 100% a result of Fred VanVleet's season-ending injury for Houston, as arguably no player will benefit more from playing time and having the ball in his hands than the 22-year-old Thompson, the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft. With the departures of Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green to Phoenix in the Kevin Durant trade, Thompson was expected to take on a larger role even before the injury. As it was, Thompson took a massive step forward last season in his sophomore campaign, raising his scoring from 9.5 PPG as a rookie to 14.1, his rebounding from 6.6 to 8.2, his assists from 2.6 to 3.8 and his blocks from 0.6 to 1.3. If he makes a similar third-year jump, Thompson will likely not only win this but be named an All-Star for the first time. The 6-foot-7 Thompson is already an elite defender and made the All-Defensive first team in 2024-25. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James is targeting a mid-November return to the floor after being sidelined with sciatica, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Wednesday. The Lakers announced Oct. 9 that James would be out 3-4 weeks, but Charania noted that James, 40, will take a \"patient approach\" with his rehabilitation process. Reports surfaced earlier this month that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute and would likely miss the entire NBA preseason . It was reported that James was ramping up his workload to prepare for the Lakers' season opener against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. However, his timeline to return has been pushed back, meaning he will miss his team's first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career. If James is indeed out until mid-November, it's possible he would miss the first 10-15 games of the season. The Lakers have a five-game road trip starting in Atlanta against the Hawks on Nov. 8 and don't play back in Los Angeles until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz . That game against the Hawks will be L.A.'s 10th game of the season. Notably, NBA awards such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA require players to play in at least 65 games. James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 70 games played during the 2024-25 season, en route to earning Second-Team All-NBA honors. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Sacramento Kings have reportedly signed forward Keegan Murray to a five-year, $140 million rookie extension, per ESPN's Shams Charania . The fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft was set to become a restricted free agent next summer, but this new deal locks him in with Sacramento through the 2030-31 season. The hope is that Murray can return to the version of himself that averaged 15.2 points on 35.8% from 3-point range in his sophomore season. He looked like a solid 3-and-D threat that season, but his numbers took a dive last season (12.4 points, 34.3% from deep), in part due to all of the changes around him on the roster with the additions of DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , and the departure of De'Aaron Fox . There was also the firing of Mike Brown and promoting Doug Christie to the lead position, which certainly contributed to Murray's third-year slump. But with a full offseason with this roster and coaching staff, Murray could certainly return to form. Unfortunately, though, he'll be starting the season on the injured list after suffering a torn ligament in his thumb which will keep him sidelined for 4-6 weeks . That's a massive loss out the gate for the Kings. But in the long-term, locking Murray into an extension is a win for a franchise that has seemed directionless over recent years. Murray's extension comes on the heels of the team signing veteran guard Russell Westbrook to a deal on Wednesday, adding him to an already overcrowded backcourt. It's unclear how Westbrook will fit on this roster, or what minutes he'll get given the team already employs Dennis Schröder, Malik Monk and Keon Ellis . But that's small potatoes when you consider all the bad moves the Kings have made over the years (like trading Tyrese Haliburton ). Signing Murray to an extension was the smart move. Either the Kings can see how Murray continues to develop, or he becomes a valuable trade chip for a contending team looking for size on the perimeter who is a career 37.2% 3-point shooter. Murray holds the Kings record for most 3s made in a single game (12), according CBS Sports research. He also broke the NBA rookie record for most 3-pointers in a season (206) and is one of just three players to post at least 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the last three seasons. The other two players in that category are Anthony Edwards and Derrick White , pretty good company to be in for the fourth-year forward. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

We have reached my favorite part of the sports calendar. The NFL and college football seasons are in full roar, it's the tail end of the MLB playoffs, the NHL is nearly two weeks into its season, college basketball is right around the corner and the NBA tips off Tuesday. The opening doubleheader is Houston at defending NBA champion Oklahoma City, which will raise its first title banner, and the nightcap is Golden State at the Los Angeles Lakers . That has lost a ton of luster because LeBron James , who will be 41 in December, will miss what could be his final opening night and is without an official timetable to return due to sciatica. James won't even be re-evaluated until after the first week or two of the season. This could be the final year of the legendary James' career, as he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time. So while I'll give you some 2025-26 NBA predictions here, you won't see any Lakers-related picks until I have some clarity on James. Do I think they have any shot at a championship? Nope. And I'd probably lean Under 48.5 wins (-145) because the team will likely limit James a lot this year to make sure he's healthy for the playoffs. These odds below are from a mix of DraftKings and FanDuel , whichever gave me a better price. This play is partly because the entire Eastern Conference looks so weak this season, but I believe the Raptors are on the rise again, led by Scottie Barnes . They have largely been irrelevant since a 48-win season in 2021-22, which was their last trip to the playoffs. Last year, Toronto won just 30 games, but that was part of the rebuild kickstarted the season before with trades of Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby . The team was also hammered by injuries. The Raptors were the in top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness. The only player who got into more than 65 games was then-rookie guard Jamal Shead . He was part of a really solid rookie class alongside Ja'Kobe Walter , Jonathan Mogbo and Jamison Battle . And now this season they've added Collin Murray-Boyles , the No. 9 overall pick in this year's draft, as well as former All-Star Brandon Ingram . He was acquired around last year's trade deadline from New Orleans but never ended up playing for Toronto due to injury. I also think Toronto at +105 to reach the Eastern Conference Play-In Tournament is good value. Either the Knicks, Cavaliers or Magic seem likely to win the incredibly watered-down East this season. Boston gutted its roster and is missing Jayson Tatum due to injury. Milwaukee lost Damian Lillard . Defending conference champion Indiana will not have its best player in Tyrese Haliburton . I never trust Joel Embiid and the Sixers. I really like Orlando after it traded for Desmond Bane in the offseason, but it's a young team that hasn't learned to win in the playoffs yet. I favor the Knicks simply because I think they finish with the East's best regular-season mark, and thus the playoffs would go through Madison Square Garden. Cleveland, which had the East's best mark last year, will be missing Darius Garland and Max Strus to start the season due to injury. The Thunder sure look like a blossoming dynasty, but so did the Celtics after they won the 2024 title. Things can go wrong. But OKC is so young and in such good shape contract-wise with its three best players ( Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren ) all now signed to long-term deals. The rest of the league should be very afraid. I would have considered Houston here after the Rockets traded for Kevin Durant , but the Rockets' odds then rose to the current number +1100 when they lost starting point guard Fred VanVleet to a season-ending torn ACL in September. The former NBA champion helped lead Houston's turnaround from lottery team to playoff contender over the past two seasons. Denver (+600) had a good offseason and might have one more run in it, but the Thunder are still miles deeper and have Holmgren and fellow 7-footer Isaiah Hartenstein to deal with Nikola Jokic in a possible playoff matchup. The Thunder blew out the Nuggets in Game 7 of the 2025 Western Conference semifinals. I don't generally like betting teams in any major sport to repeat, much less at such a cheap price. Plus, champions have a bulls-eye on their backs. I will be playing Under 63.5 wins for the Thunder (-160 at DK). But short of injuries, I don't really see a club beating OKC in a long series. Holmgren has proven himself a bit of an injury risk, and Williams continues to recover from surgery on his right wrist after playing the entire postseason with torn ligaments, but injuries generally hit older teams the hardest, and OKC is still one of the league's youngest. That's what made last season's title even more impressive. Last year, the Thunder had an average age of 25.6 years to become second-youngest championship team in league history, older than only the 1976-77 Portland Trail Blazers led by Bill Walton. Oklahoma City over New York in the Finals is a +1200 second-favorite on the exact result board after OKC over Cleveland at +1100. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "Draymond Green doesn't think he could average 20 points on a lottery team", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/draymond-green-doesnt-think-he-could-average-20-points-on-a-lottery-team/", "published_at": "2025-10-15T20:39:43+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Green has no desire to play \"bad basketball\" on a losing team", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Draymond Green begins his 14th NBA season when the Warriors take on the Lakers Oct. 22 on opening night. He is a four-time champion, Defensive Player of the Year winner, four-time All Star and two-time All-NBA player. He will retire as a first-ballot Hall of Famer easily, and despite the ever evolving roster around him, Green will almost certainly retire with the Warriors. But Green's also at the point in his career where we see some decline in players, which often leads to the team making a tough decision in moving on from them in favor of a younger -- or in Klay Thompson's case, a cheaper -- option. However, Green doesn't appear to be itching to leave Golden State, and even if he did it certainly wouldn't be for a rebuilding team. \"Could I average 20 [points] on a lottery team? I have no interest in doing that,\" Green said on the \"Why is Draymond Green Talking About Football?\" podcast when asked how much he could average on a lottery team. \"You want me to go play bad basketball? ... I once averaged 15 [points] on a great team. So, you do the math.\" Green is probably the worst person to ask that question to, because he's never been the type of player to chase stats. The reason he's considered an all-time great is because he carved out a role for himself with the Warriors which consists of a lot of intangible things that don't show up on the box score. He's going to be the defensive anchor, capable of sliding between multiple positions, can be the connector offensively as a facilitator and is the heart of the Warriors dynasty with his fiery personality which has its pros and cons. That lone season Green averaged 15 points (actually was 14 points but that's a minor discrepancy) is the year that the Warriors set the record for most regular season wins with 73. That team clicked on all cylinders in more ways than one, and could be considered the peak of Golden State's powers despite losing in the Finals to LeBron James and the Cavaliers . Since that year, Green's role has been less of a scorer and more as a Swiss army knife doing whatever is necessary. \"I don't know if I have that mindset anymore,\" Green said. \"That's a mindset that you have to have, and I left that mindset so long ago that I'm not sure I could even tap back into that. ... The reason I got to the NBA is because I could score. To then come into the NBA and be doing that, and then like have to switch the whole thing up, it's hard to just go back to that. It requires you to change how you see the game. There's a certain way that I had to start seeing the game for our teams to work. So to then try to flip back to that, it's a very tough thing to do.\" Luckily, Green probably doesn't have to concern himself with those hypotheticals, because it would be incredibly shocking if he didn't retire with the Warriors. Or at the very least if he were to leave, he'd certainly join another championship-contending team. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

We all have our favorites. Every year, the NBA staff at CBS Sports ranks the 100 best players in the league. And every year, inevitably, each of us has a player or two that we ranked substantially higher than everyone else. Maybe it's a young player we expect to grow. Maybe it's someone on a team we happen to watch more than others. Maybe it's a player who's been stuck in the wrong circumstances but is primed for a breakout. Or maybe it's just irrational faith. But it's a central part of the basketball-viewing experience. We all have players that we simply believe in more than anyone else. So this year, we're going to put our metaphorical money where our mouths are. Each of us decided to highlight one player that we ranked higher than all or most of the rest of the voters. Below, we will explain what we see in those players that the rest of the basketball world does not. These are the players that our staff consider to be the most underrated in the NBA going into the 2025-26 season. The Pelicans are so cursed that the one reasonably consistent part of their team is by far the most overlooked. Trey Murphy isn't the predestined franchise player battling conditioning issues like Zion Williamson . He's not the ace defender with wildly fluctuating shooting percentages like Herb Jones. He's really the only young player in New Orleans who has simply arrived and progressed in a somewhat linear fashion towards potential stardom. You can count on one hand how many players combine his shooting and athleticism, and with so many teammates missing time last season, Murphy, No. 72 on our list, got his first taste of a star-caliber work load. He handled it with aplomb, largely maintaining his efficiency despite increased volume while getting to the line and assisting at career-best rates. Things may be rough in New Orleans, but Murphy is the diamond waiting to be mined from this mess. -- Sam Quinn There's been so much discussion about the Nuggets ' offseason acquisitions to boost their depth that it seems like everyone has forgotten about Braun, who snuck on to our list at No. 95. He was awesome last season in a breakout campaign in which he averaged an extremely efficient 15.4 points on 58/39.7/82.7 shooting splits. Only four other players in the league averaged at least 15 points on 58% shooting or better last season, and they were all centers: Giannis Antetokounmpo , Domantas Sabonis , Mark Williams and Ivica Zubac . Braun is an excellent cutter and finishes everything in transition, which makes him a perfect partner for Nikola Jokić. No Nuggets teammates played more minutes together than Braun and Jokić, and when they were on the floor Denver had a plus-11.8 net rating. The big question for Braun and the Nuggets is whether he can become a more consistent outside shooter. He shot 39.7% last season, but only took 2.8 attempts per game; in the playoffs, when teams dared him to beat them, he made just 29.6% of 5.1 attempts per game. -- Jack Maloney I anticipate a minutes bump and an All-Defense nod for Thompson this season, and I bet he'll be much higher on next year's list. Yes, his poor shooting is a problem, but, fortunately, he's awesome at pretty much everything else. Few defenders are as much of a menace one-on-one, and his feel for the game on both ends is exceptional. Thompson, ranked 75th on our list, gets ridiculous rebounds, and the Pistons plan to put him on the ball a lot more this season , which means everybody will get to see that he has much more to offer on offense than his cutting in the halfcourt and his speed in transition. -- James Herbert I understand why the ranking on Embiid was so varied, given injuries have to factor into these projections. That said, if Embiid can get back to even playing 50+ games this season (certainly a big if), I think 26 is far lower than he belongs. He is one of the most dominant forces in the game when he's functional, and as he ramps up for the regular season, the hope is he's closer to the level we saw before his latest knee injury in 2023-24. I don't know if we'll ever see the MVP-level Embiid again, but even if he's 85% of the player he was at his peak, he's among the game's best bigs. This is a player who averaged north of 30 points and 10 rebounds per game for three straight seasons (while providing high-end rim protection). Perhaps I'm wish-casting a bit here, but I really hope we see at least one more run of Embiid near his best because he is one of the most unique, talented forces the league has ever seen. -- Robby Kalland Maybe Josh Hart's problem is that he's too easy to forget. Or at least he's severely undervalued. But this guy -- ranked 94th in our Top 100 -- does everything for the Knicks . I could've made the argument that he was New York's second-most important player last season. You might not agree, but I assure you on a lot of nights it's an honest argument. He swings so many games with his rebounding, pace pushing, end-to-end buckets, et cetera. We all love to focus on some of the lineup limitations he brings because of his shooting inconsistencies, but bottom line is Hart can be a borderline top-50 player when it comes down to impacting winning. -- Brad Botkin © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Sacramento Kings are signing free agent point guard Russell Westbrook , his agent told ESPN's Shams Charania . Details of the deal weren't immediately reported, but the expectation is that Westbrook is signing for his veteran minimum to help bolster Sacramento's backcourt rotation. Westbrook, 36, will be playing his 18th NBA season for his seventh different team after spending the 2024-25 campaign with the Denver Nuggets . Since Westbrook was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Houston Rockets in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Nuggets. The Kings will be Westbrook's fourth different team since the start of the 2022-23 season. With Westbrook going to Sacramento, he will provide point guard depth to a team that entered the offseason without a true player at the position on the roster. The Kings signed free agent point guard Dennis Schröder to a three-year deal earlier this offseason but had strong interest in Westbrook dating back to the opening of free agency in July. Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver, averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Sacramento entered the offseason with a logjam in the backcourt with Keon Ellis , Malik Monk , DeMar DeRozan , Zach LaVine , Devin Carter and new first-round rookie Nique Clifford . When the Kings traded De'Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs at last season's trade deadline, Sacramento experimented with Monk at point guard after he entered the season as a reserve, but it didn't work out.

Lists like this -- 25 under 25 in this case -- lists are not uncommon, especially heading into the 2025-26 NBA season. But instead of adding to the significant amount of discourse already in that area, we're going to tweak that concept just a bit and rank the 25 best prospects in the NBA today. Ranking prospects can be vastly different than players because one is about forecasting for the future, while the other is an assessment of where they are today. In other words, this list is more about who are the best long-term assets, or who could be the best players when they reach their prime, and not who are the best today. Put it another way, if salary camp implications weren't a consideration, which active NBA players under the age of 25 would you most like to have if you were building a roster. Let's get to it. This list is debatable at virtually every spot, except this one. The only way that Wemby isn't the best long-term prospect in the NBA is if durability becomes a huge problem. Despite last year's blood clot issue, we don't have any evidence that is the case. To the contrary, prior to that, his availability had exceeded expectations. His unprecedented overlap of measurables and mobility allows him to change the game defensively unlike any other player in the league. Offensively, he's been given the freedom to shoot threes and stretch his game over the last two years and, while some of his efficiency metrics could trend up, he showed more alpha potential than even most projected on draft night two years ago. The bottom line is that if he's healthy, he's every bit the generational talent that was promised. Edwards may be one of the older players on this list, but he's also one of the best players in the NBA right now. He put up 28 points per game last year while leading the association in made 3s. For those of us that have been tracking him since high school, it's the escalation of his shooting that has proven to be the biggest surprise. The force with which he can create is not unsurprisingly, but couple that with the shooting and creation for others, and you have a player who looks poised to be one of the league's best guards for the foreseeable future. Of course, nothing cements a player's reputation like their production under the bright lights, and the 24-year-old has already developed a reputation for having that clutch gene come playoff time. The 22-year-old Banchero is coming off a shortened 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged nearly 26 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists. So, while there are probably a handful of reasonable candidates to round out the top three, ultimately Banchero got the nod for two distinct reasons. First and foremost is the extreme rate of improvement. I've been watching him live since the spring of his freshman year of high school and seen him make notable jumps with each passing year. Second, despite being just 22-years-old, he's already a proven offensive focal point. This year, he's going to have the chance to prove he can do it on a contender as the addition of Desmond Bane should be critical to taking the Magic to the next level. Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now : While I don't expect Flagg to be better this season than everyone below him on this list, this ranking is on long-term potential. If I were starting a team today, I would choose to build around him rather than anyone else besides the aforementioned three. He can play multiple positions, change the game defensively, and has an ideal overlap of intense competitor and instinctive processor. If he proves he can be the type of offensive alpha who can lead a contending team, then this spot might even prove to be too low, but it's relatively aggressive given some of the already proven prospects that are still behind him. He's also 18 years old. In other words, he's got a runway of the next 15-plus years. What we saw last season was essentially what most of us who have seen Cunningham since high school have been expecting for years. Cunningham became one of the best players in the NBA. He not only averaged 26 points, nine assists, and six rebounds per game, but he put up a career high 35.6% from 3 on a career high 5.3 attempts per game, all the while leading the NBA's most-improved team. The shooting fell off a little bit in the playoffs, but everything else was just as good. Simultaneously, he was very solid on the defensive end of the floor. So, if the shooting keeps getting more reliable, especially in key moments, and most importantly he stays healthy, Cunningham should be poised to play the best basketball of his career for the next five or so years. SGA may have been the MVP, but Williams was just as valuable to OKC's championship run. His versatility, two-way impact, and consistent improvement are all widely acknowledged, and rightfully so. Beyond that though was his toughness to play through injury and unselfishness to buy into his role and not allow any fraction or dissent to be formed around role allocation. The only knock is that he is more Robin than Batman on the offensive end, but that may be contextual. Not only did he put up 22 points per game on 48/37/79 shooting, but he averaged five assists per game and was one of the best iso scores in the NBA according to the advanced analytics. Other than Wemby, Holmgren is the young center that I would most want to build my roster around for the foreseeable future. In a league that values two-way versatility and offensive spacing, Holmgren is a 7-footer who can stretch the floor and already an elite rim protector. The durability of his frame has been a talking point for years now, and after missing the 2022-23 season and 50 regular-season games last year, that's going to continue to be a key variable in his future. However, he's functionally stronger than almost anyone expected, provides optionality to their lineups because of his ability to play the four or five, and is still sacrificing some of his individual offense to build this young championship core. There is a case to be made that Thompson is both the best athlete and non-Wemby defender in the NBA. He's also one of the more versatile, and maybe even positionless, players in the NBA. In just two seasons, we've seen him guard everyone from opposing big men to guards. Now, to start Year 3, with Fred VanVleet going down with injury and Ime Udoka experimenting with some jumbo line-ups in the preseason, we may get a chance to see if Thompson has some of that point guard potential that was talked about a couple of years ago when he was going through the pre-draft process. The reining Defensive Player of the Year was also named second team All-NBA last year, while pushing his numbers to nearly 19 points and nine rebounds per game on a Cavs team that won 64 games. Essentially, it was the realization of the vast potential that has been easily recognizable since his days in high school. The 24-year-old is poised to be the hub of a top-notch defense for years to come, but it will be the progression of his offensive game that ultimately dictates his ceiling. Based on the early reviews this preseason, when Mobley has been handling the ball and extending his range more, his two-way versatility appears to be still ascending. Sengun is the most polarizing player among the top 10, even among NBA decision-makers. His supporters cite his interior skill, playmaking from the 5 spot, and surprising durability. His doubters the limited athleticism, lack of defensive versatility, and rim protection. He is starting this season in the best shape of his career so far, with an opportunity to be even more of a playmaker in VanFleet's absence, and alongside a generational scorer like Kevin Durant . It's also worth noting that Sengun doesn't rely on athleticism to be productive, so the 23-year-old's style should age well. Maxey is the oldest player on this list and will turn 25 in less than a month. Put another way, while some players project to be trending up for the foreseeable future, he's now probably in his prime. The 2023-24 season was one in which he showed real potential stardom. Last year wasn't just riddled by injuries, but also declining efficiencies and a 3-point percentage that was almost 10% lower than two years prior. With Maxey's ability to make on-ball reads having dramatically improved over the years, he can be virtually unguardable when the 3s are falling. Increased physicality and durability are other points of emphasis, as he steps into more of a true leadership role for the Sixers. Is he or is he not a true No. 1 option on offense? That is one of, if not the, biggest question that faces the Raptors moving forward. Getting a definitive answer to that question is also one of the major subplots of this season. Barnes was a 22-year-old All-Star a couple of years ago, but saw his numbers drop across the board last year as his volume increased. Even if he proves to be better suited as a secondary option though, he still has the potential to impact the game in a multitude of ways, on both ends of the floor. The key variable hasn't changed since he was in high school though ... so much of it comes down to the shooting. We're now at the point on the list where we've exhausted all the probable lead creators. In Orlando, Wagner has been slotted as the secondary option behind Banchero, and yet he still put up 24 points, six boards, and five dimes last season. The combination of wing size at 6-foot-10 and playmaking off the dribble, makes him a true mismatch problem, while his defensive value is often understated as well. For a non-primary though, the floor spacing is going to have to keep coming. He's been under 30% from behind the arc for two consecutive years, despite being above 85% from the free-throw line, and needs to be able to create more space off the ball. What we said on draft night four months ago remains true today. Harper is a big lead guard with size, strength, length, and terrific natural instincts. His long-term success is going to come down to three key variables: shooting, durability and defense. He's battled nagging injuries for years, historically has had a bit of a flatter shot, and never had to truly commit to maximizing his defense. But he has all the tools and talent and now looks like he could be the best sub-20 point guard prospect in the league. Johnson finally started to turn potential into production as a 21-year-old back in the 2023-24. Last year, came the full breakout before he was derailed by a shoulder injury. A high-level athlete on the wing with positional size and playmaking for others, he now looks like a real building block for Atlanta. The only caveat is that this optimism is based on two seasons in which he has played only a combined 92 games. So, like others on this list, shooting and durability are key pieces. Alongside an ultra-skilled shot-maker like Trae Young though, he's found an ideal fit to maximize what he does best. Staying in Atlanta, we have one of the best up-and-coming perimeter defenders in the league. Daniels' defensive playmaking metrics were off the charts last year with 3.7 stocks per game and nearly six rebounds leading to the Most Improved Player award. Not only is he a playmaker on that end, but he protects Young, and simultaneously made notable strides with his offense. If he can sustain, or continue, the gains he made as a floor spacer and keep providing some secondary creation, his value should only continue to ascend this year for the Hawks. Just three years removed from being the 21st pick, Braun has already proven to be one of the best picks of his draft class. He moved into the starting lineup last season and more than doubled his production, averaging 15 points, five boards, and nearly three assists on 58/40/83 shooting. What's a little misleading is that he attempted only three threes in his roughly 34 minutes per game, so his gravity will increase with his volume, but he's an extremely efficient transition finisher to complement Nikola Jokic 's open court passing, and also a plus defender. In short, he may not be a star, but he looks like a long-term NBA starter. After four seasons in Washington, Avdija's new zip code brought a breakout year with the Blazers. He averaged 17 points, seven boards, and four assists while sustaining the notable jump in 3-point shooting that he posted the year before with the Wizards . The best part was that he continued to raise the level of his game as the season went on. At 6-foot-9, he combines strength and physicality with playmaking off the dribble to create a definite mismatch problem, not to mention a solid positional defender. Now he looks like a core building block moving forward for Portland. Lively exceeded expectations right out of the gate as a rookie in Dallas, and maintained those numbers, albeit in an injury-plagued sophomore year. Still just 21 years old, the hope is that he will establish himself as the Mavs' clear-cut top center this season. He has immense defensive potential with his size, length, shot-blocking, and relative mobility. Offensively, he's a lob threat and extremely efficient finisher, although life without Luka Dončić may be a bit different. That niche alone gives him the potential to be a starting center in this league for the next decade, so long as he can stay healthy. Miller was recently tabbed by league GM's as one of the favorites to have a breakout season. While he played just 27 games last season, we saw some clear evidence of where his game was trending. He was taking a high-volume approach from behind the arc and basing the rest of his attack around the threat of his jumper. There was growth as a passer for others, but continued struggles as a finisher, and defender. This year, it feels like Charlotte is at a crossroads and needs to decide if they'll continue to build around Miller and LaMelo Ball . Last year's Rookie of the Year is a big guard with size, strength, athleticism, on-off ball versatility and two-ways tools. He was already one of the Spurs' best perimeter defenders last year, not to mention a consistent scoring threat at 15 points per game. The question this year is whether or not he can take the next step in a perimeter rotation that is both young and collectively strained from a spacing perspective. In other words, how are all these driving playmakers going to coexist if they can't space the floor for each other. This is bound to be the most debated spot on the list. To be clear, this isn't about sheer talent. Ball's natural ability with the basketball, creativity, and vision, coupled by his tremendous positional size, form the profile of a truly elite prospect. Through five NBA seasons though, there are two glaring problems and a looming question. First, he can't stay healthy. He's played more than 51 games just once and hasn't eclipsed 47 games in any of the last three years. Second, he's one of the most lackadaisical defenders in the league. Put it together, and despite his gifts, Charlotte has to be wondering if he can ever drive winning at a consistent level. The case for Bailey is simple -- he's a high-level athlete with wing size and tough shot-making ability. The case against him has to do with his overall feel and efficiency. The summer league provided evidence for both perspectives. What has been encouraging though are the early returns in the preseason as Bailey has already made real strides with his understanding of how to get to spots, not waste dribbles, and move without the ball. You never want to overvalue the preseason, but the signs of growth are real and his upside has always been undeniable. Anyone who followed last year's draft knows Edgecombe is an elite athlete, has a ton of defensive upside, and a consistently developing offensive game. What most people don't yet have a full appreciation for is his competitiveness and drive to improve. It's that, and not just the physical tools, which could fuel his development in the coming years. There's clearly plenty of work to be done, but Edgecombe is poised to be an overachiever. There's a case to be made that Giddey is one of the more undervalued young players in the league. He's been a starter in all four years in the association. Last year, his first in Chicago, he averaged 15 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists on 47/38/78 shooting. After the All-Star break, he put up 21 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists per game. Those all-star caliber numbers earned him a new 100-million-dollar contract, but still arguably not enough respect across the league. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Rookie patches are about to change the hobby again — only this time in the NBA. Fanatics recently announced it will include Rookie Debut Patches for players starting with the upcoming NBA season . Even though the season hasn’t begun yet, the chase is already on for the most coveted of all those NBA Rookie Debut Patch cards — the Dallas Mavericks’ Cooper Flagg. The Rookie Debut Patch Autographed card has already become one of the most collectible modern cards. In March, the MLB Rookie Debut Autographed Patch card of Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes sold for $1.1 million to Dick’s Sporting Goods . That sale turned a lot of heads, thrusting modern baseball card collecting into the spotlight — a space long dominated by vintage cards. The question as we head into the NBA season: Can Flagg’s Rookie Debut Patch card beat that number? It’s quite possible. There are a couple of elements that could boost Flagg’s card over the Skenes record. The first is the international appeal of the NBA. It has a massive global following, especially in Asia, where many of the most sought-after NBA cards have ended up. The league has held preseason games in Asia since 2004, including two games in Macau this year that coincided with the Asia Sports Collectors Convention (ASCC). The ASCC’s special guest signers were also overwhelmingly former NBA stars, including Dwyane Wade, Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett. Topps added another international layer last week, launching its first NBA product in 15 years — 2025-26 NBA Match Attax — exclusively in China. Another factor: Many of the top modern card sales have been basketball cards. Of the top five sales in 2025 so far, all have been modern NBA cards, with four of the five sold privately. Those cards have ranged from $2.3 million to $12.9 million and have featured some of the NBA’s all-time greats, including Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Luka Dončić. Adding the layers of a robust international market, and private collectors seeking high-end cards, there may well be a person or group willing to take a gamble on Flagg’s Rookie Debut Autographed Patch when it hits the market later this season. The NBA tips off the 2025-26 season on Oct. 21, with Flagg and the Mavericks' first game coming on Oct. 22. It’s safe to say many eyes will be on that game as fans wait to see what the newest rookie can do. If Flagg lives up to the hype, don’t be shocked if his card becomes the most expensive Rookie Debut Patch card ever."}

They'll win games they frankly have no business winning. But ultimately, this team has a fairly set ceiling, despite acquiring Norman Powell for freaking peanuts. Could this season, if they finish in the play-in again, prove to shake the foundation of Heat culture? Maybe, maybe not. But at the very least, it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to be open to new interpretations of roster construction. The arrival of Joe Dumars to helm the front office has already been a disaster in terms of asset evaluation. One look at this roster, and it's clear the odds are against the Pelicans making any type of competitive push. With an increasingly angered fan base, eventually the organization is going to need a fall guy, and that person is unlikely to be Dumars. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Enter Willie Green, who is entering his fifth season as the organization's head coach. So far, he has won 148 games, lost 180 and hasn't exactly stood out as a beacon of hope for fans. While he's done reasonably well given the circumstances, 10 total playoff games isn't enough to save him from the chopping block, especially if the team starts poorly and the franchise needs an excuse to keep fans invested. It appears all the more likely Green will be out of there if things go sideways. Is it fair? Probably not. But when has that ever stopped any NBA organization from firing its coach? Doc Rivers is notorious for avoiding responsibility, blaming his players, not playing young guys and installing offensive systems that lack nuance. With the Bucks firmly up against the wall, after waiving and stretching Damian Lillard, and spending their last remaining bullets on signing Myles Turner, they're going to look for a scapegoat as soon as Giannis Antetokounmpo sneezes, and odds are good that will be Rivers. The twist is that firing Rivers would easily be justified, even without the element of a scapegoat, but that probably won't stop the Bucks from applying that logic anyway, seeing as Rivers is easier to replace than making significant roster upgrades. (That's what happens when you decide to paint yourself fully into a corner.) Of course, it shouldn't just be Rivers potentially seeing his head roll here. The franchise spends more time being concerned about retaining Antetokounmpo than actually trying to build a contender around him, which is what he wants. General manager Jon Horst and the front office have spent years attacking the problem from the wrong angle, and seem hell-bent to continue that pattern for ... reasons? We'll see if the Bucks come out swinging and use the downfall of the Celtics and Pacers to their advantage. If they do, perhaps they all slide into safety. But that won't leave Bucks fans particularly optimistic about the future. Hornets are usually very protective of their colony and are ready to throw down in tough times. That hasn't been the case for a while in Charlotte. This organization is all over the place to the point where we can't limit any one person to becoming the sacrificial lamb. If this teams starts off poorly again, especially with a healthy roster, everything should be on the table, including moving off, yes, LaMelo Ball. The roster lacks cohesion and symmetry, and has developed habits that make you wonder if it can ever turn the narrative around as a collective group. This team needs better players, a stronger strategy and a true long-term plan, all of which seem to be a bit of an afterthought these days. Organizational changes should be more than welcome, especially if the Hornets are far below .500 when the calendar turns to 2026. The answer is a resounding no, and that's not the worst part. Including them here, which intends to point toward possible reactions to poor performance, is actually a joke, because they don't make changes. In fact, the front office and coaching staff, namely Artūras Karnišovas and Billy Donovan, seem to continue receiving contract extensions for a job not done, by just finding themselves in the play-in tournament every year. If the league had such issues with the Philadelphia 76ers that it decided to move Sam Hinkie off his post during The Process, what exactly is keeping it from doing the same to the Bulls? At least The Process Sixers had a plan and made a genuine attempt at acquiring future stars, to a point where they could compete for a championship. The Bulls are standing still, by choice, and that should infuriate the league enough to reach out to Mr. Burner, Bryan Colangelo, to at least do something other than what's currently being done. (That's a joke. No team should entertain Colangelo as a real option.) But the point stands. This organization rewards its own members in reaching pointless mediocrity, and if that isn't grounds for change, then what is?"}

Like, the comfortable thing to do is to not do my -- I call them night labs, which is when I shoot at night,\" Tillman told Celtics insider Chris Forsberg. \"But the comfortable thing is to not do the night labs and to just be home every night and just kicking it and just being content with everything that I have. \"I'm grateful for everything that I have, but I'm not content with it. And the separation I guess for me is that I just want the most that I can get out of playing basketball. And so for me, in order to get that, you've got to put in the work.\" Tillman noted that the night labs involve more than just shooting. \"You have to do all these extra stretches and get all this treatment and get massages all the time.

While the game itself presents numerous variables that determine wins and losses, hard work away from the arena never loses. \"Preparation to me is like, when I say it's better than the game, it's more so just getting to see yourself progress and progress and progress and progress, because in a game, you have wins and losses,\" he said. \"But like when it comes to just progression, working out, there's not too many losses -- as long as you're pushing yourself in there.

Some of the potential obstacles on the Knicks’ path to the NBA Finals have been cleared in the eyes of Miller and others with Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics and Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers suffering Achilles injuries that are expected to sideline them for most or all of the season. The Knicks went 51-31 last season to take the third seed in the East behind the Cleveland Cavaliers and Celtics. New York upset the Boston in the second round before falling to Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Knicks brought back their entire core, added depth with Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele, and replaced head coach Tom Thibodeau with Mike Brown . With both the Celtics and Pacers each missing their top player, and with up-and-coming teams like the Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic still developing, the Knicks are expected to compete with the Cavs for the top spot in the East. “Cleveland had the best record a year ago…they kept their core intact, but they’re still unproven in the playoffs,” Miller said. “To me, the Knicks with their new coach in Mike Brown and the best clutch player in the game from a year ago in Jalen Brunson, I just think everything is set up for the Knicks to win the East. Now again, you’ve gotta go out there and actually do it, but I think this is the year for the Knicks in the East, guys.” “Well, Reg,” Miller’s fellow NBC analyst Jamal Crawford added, “I’m shocked to hear you give the Knicks this much love.” It's in the NBA Finals where Miller thinks the Knicks could run into trouble. The defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder open the season Tuesday against the Houston Rockets in the NBA’s long-awaited return to NBC. Miller, who will call the season-opening game on NBC and Peacock alongside Crawford and play-by-play announcer Mike Tirico, believes the Thunder are positioned for a potential dynasty. “Are we seeing the formation of maybe a young Chicago Bulls team here in OKC?” Miller asked – comparing the young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren to the Bulls’ 1990s core of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. “With Shai being à la MJ, and J-Dub being à la Scottie Pippen, Chet-Rodman? I mean they have the makeup, the coaching pedigree, they’re very deep and from everything I’ve been reading and watching, they seem very hungry. Look, I know the West is loaded and Denver has reloaded, and Minnesota, but to me OKC, if they stay hungry and healthy I love their chances of repeating.” The celebration for the upcoming season and the league’s return to NBC got underway Thursday in New York City at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Outside the iconic building is a new LED-basketball court that’s open to the public and a display of 30 customized basketballs – titled “30 Rocks” – designed by local artists to reflect the culture of each NBA team and the unique style of the artist. A post shared by NBA (@nba) The Larry O’Brien Trophy also made its way to the Top of the Rock. A post shared by NBA on NBC and Peacock (@nbaonnbc) “The NBA is like no other sport in terms of excitement, energy, greatest athletes, front row seats to it for those of us who get to broadcast the games,” Tirico said, “and I cannot be more excited for next Tuesday in Oklahoma City as they raise the banner and get this started.” Miller was one of the faces of the league when NBC last broadcasted NBA games from 1990 to 2002. Some of his most memorable performances aired on the network – usually against the Knicks. “When this opportunity presented itself with NBC, I had some of my best moments on this network,” Miller said. “And personally, for a chance for myself to come home and be able to tell stories and hopefully create new moment for the next generation, personally for me, I’m a kid in a candy store.”"}

As it has been for seemingly decades, the Western Conference is just better. It’s deeper than its Eastern counterpart, and this season it also features the two best teams in the league. All of which makes projecting it difficult because every team’s margin for error is small, except maybe the Thunder. Let’s break down the West by Tiers. 1. Thunder 2. Nuggets 3. Timberwolves 4. Rockets 5. Lakers 6. Warriors 7. Clippers 8. Spurs 9. Mavericks 10. Grizzlies 11. Pelicans 12. Trail Blazers 13. Kings 14. Suns 15. Jazz Denver Nuggets defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder The two best teams in the NBA are in the West, and ultimately, it is going to come down to them — the Western Conference Finals might as well be the NBA Finals. Oklahoma City won the title last season, it’s bringing back 14 players from that roster, and its core players are just entering their prime and are still improving. Denver has the best player on the planet in Nikola Jokic, and they finally went out and upgraded the talent around him with Cameron Johnson (an improvement over Michael Porter Jr.), Jonas Valanciunas (the best backup Jokic has had), Bruce Brown, and Luke Kennard joining Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon. I am picking Denver to win it all because of Jokic, but this would be a coin toss of a series. After that, there are a bunch of good teams, but with questions that have to be answered — these seven teams could land in almost any order (I just trust a couple more in the playoffs, so they rank higher): • Minnesota has made the Western Conference Finals in back-to-back years, and star Anthony Edwards is on the verge of being a top-five player in the world, but there are doubts about them taking another step without Nickeil Alexander-Walker (now in Atlanta) and an aging Mike Conley at the point. • Houston was in my top contenders tier until Fred VanVleet was lost for the season with a torn ACL. The Rockets are an elite defensive squad with depth and improving young talent all over the roster — Alperen Sengun was an All-Star and Amen Thompson is about to be. The addition of Kevin Durant fixed their biggest need, half-court offense. However, without VanVleet, we need to see how Thompson and Reed Sheppard handle the role of initiating the offense. If it comes together, the Rockets are a legitimate threat to the Thunder and Nuggets, but VanVleet is a bigger loss than people realize. • The Lakers are without LeBron James to start the season, but that’s not really what’s concerning (Luka Doncic is such a floor raiser it shouldn’t impact them that much). Los Angeles is going to be good, but if it is going to threaten OKC and Denver it has questions to answer: Will they defend well enough, particularly in the minutes Doncic and Austin Reaves are both on the court? Is Deandre Ayton going to consistently be the defensive presence in the paint and rim-running big man on offense the Lakers need? Do the Lakers have enough shooting around Doncic? Can the Doncic/LeBron/Reaves trio develop enough chemistry during the season to overcome the defensive issues? That’s a lot of questions. • The analytics-based projection systems love the Warriors and the trio of Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green. Golden State undoubtedly will be an outstanding team when healthy, but with those three players all being over age 35, plus four other key rotation players — Al Horford, Seth Curry, Gary Payton II and Buddy Hield — all being 32+, can this roster stay healthy and be rested and fully charged for the playoffs? It’s a question of age with this group, and Jonathan Kuminga is not going to save them on that front (if he’s even there after the trade deadline). • The Clippers could finish anywhere from 3-7 in the West and it wouldn’t surprise me – I don’t expect the cloud of the Aspiration/Kawhi Leonard scandal to bother this veteran team on the court. The Clippers are deep and talented, look for a bounce-back season from Bradley Beal. Tyron Lue’s biggest problem when this team is healthy is getting everyone minutes. Health is the big question though, especially for Leonard and James Harden. While I love the Clippers for the first 82 games, when it gets to the playoffs, I do not trust their health or Harden. • Victor Wembanyama is going to have a monster year on both ends of the court for the Spurs, Dylan Harper looks like the real deal, and this is a team that — once De’Aaron Fox gets healthy — could start to come together and finish top six in the West. This season feels like the first big step to San Antonio being a title contender within a couple of years. • The front line of Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg and Dereck Lively is one of the best in the NBA – this is a long, athletic team across the board. Once Kyrie Irving returns midseason (think 2026, but there is no timeline), the Mavericks quickly become a team capable of making a late push up the standings, the team nobody wants to see in a playoff series. The teams after that just have even more questions, and that’s rough in a conference this deep. Memphis is starting the season without Jaren Jackson Jr., Zach Edey and Brandon Clarke, their top three big men, so how much of the load can Ja Morant handle on his own? A slimmed-down Zion Williamson has looked good in preseason, but he’s got to stay healthy for a season and lift up everyone around him — on a kind of mismatched roster — before we start to believe. Portland has so much athleticism, youth, and potential that they will be fun to watch, but they are not yet a good team. Sacramento has plenty of talented offensive players — Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Dennis Schroder, the just-extended Keegan Murray — but this is the “ Island of Misfit Toys ” roster and it could get ugly (plus, midseason trades of stars are coming). I have the retooling Suns in the “hoping for the play-in” tier to start the season because Devin Booker is in his prime and elite, but this roster isn’t a threat (the Wizards hold swap rights on the Suns’ first-round pick next June, which could get strange late in the season). The Jazz are at least honest about their plans this season, and watching Ace Bailey and the other young talent will have us tuning in to see how things look. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry is known for his long-range ability on the basketball court. Apparently, that superpower extends to all of Curry's sporting accolades. Curry showed off his fantastic driving ability and clutch skills during an episode of Bryson DeChambeau's YouTube show \"Break 50\" on Wednesday. During the episode, Curry even managed to outdrive DeChambeau, who is known for his ridiculous drives. Before the episode truly got underway, DeChambeau explained Curry was among the most-requested guests to appear on the program, which features DeChambeau teaming up with a celebrity or athlete to try and shoot under 50 at a golf course. Tom Brady, Adam Sandler and President Donald Trump have all appeared on the show in the past. Once Curry hits his first shot, it's apparent why fans wanted to see him compete with DeChambeau. Curry drilled the ball onto the green, leaving it just 4 feet from the hole. He sunk the putt on his next shot, giving the team a -2 right off the bat. Curry essentially played a flawless game early, not allowing DeChambeau to putt on the first three holes. After a ball rimmed out on the fourth hole, DeChambeau finally got his chance to sink his first putt of the day. He was successful, keeping the team in the hunt for a score under 50. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] It was a dominant performance by both men. Curry and DeChambeau combined to shoot par on just one hole on the day. They were so dominant elsewhere, with multiple eagles, that they managed to shoot a 49, accomplishing their goal of breaking 50. While DeChambeau played excellent golf, that was expected. Curry's dominance was so impressive that DeChambeau quipped \"you need to play professional golf\" after the 18th hole. Curry played it off, telling DeChambeau \"don't you start.\" Curry going pro in another sport isn't likely to happen soon. The 37-year-old is still among the best players in the NBA. Last season, he averaged 24.5 points with the Warriors and helped the team upset the Houston Rockets in the first round of the NBA playoffs. Curry will look to win his fifth NBA championship this season, as the Warriors try and regroup after somewhat of a down year. While Curry still has a few years of strong production left in him, the end of his career will be here before long. At that point, he might want to consider taking up golf. Plenty of athletes from other sports have tried — and mostly failed — at becoming professional golfers after retiring from their main sport. Curry was so good in DeChambeau's video that he could wind up breaking that trend."}

Green has earned four NBA All-Star selections, two All-NBA nods and a Defensive Player of the Year award, while Curry has collected two MVP trophies and revolutionized the modern game with his shooting. So many around the league have put Curry on a pedestal — including coach Steve Kerr, who told Burke he is “the solar system of everything Golden State does.” Burke reminded Green that much of the conversation centers on maximizing Curry’s greatness and getting him a fifth ring.

Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. “Everybody else can say what they say, and that's fine, but I know how he feels,\" Green explained. \"And as long as I know how the man feels, that's good enough for me, you know, I know the love and support and appreciation that he has for me. If I'm not appreciated by one other person, what other one really matters if he does?” As the Warriors prepare for another season and a possible fifth championship run, Green’s focus remains on the same thing that’s fueled their dynasty from the start — his belief in Curry and the team around him.

At best. To think he would only miss six games or so after having battled this nerve issue since late July or early August was highly unlikely, it was going to be longer (which is why our initial story suggested mid-November was more realistic). Now comes the report that the Lakers are being “patient” and want the 40-year-old to return to full health, not rush him, which has them thinking mid-November for LeBron’s return, via Shams Charania of ESPN speaking on NBA Today . “I’m told that the Lakers and LeBron are looking at around mid-November as a realistic debut for him, and so October 30th would be the earliest that the Lakers would be officially reevaluating LeBron James, but it is expected he will need at least a few weeks after that point. A source told me tonight that LeBron will be taking a patient approach with this rehab from nerve injury.” That tracks with what we know about recovery from sciatica, it is not a fast process. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, His return ultimately depends upon healing whatever is compressing the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. The nerve can be compressed by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, muscle tissue after lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. LeBron’s injury is not going to hit the Lakers too hard on the court at the start of the season (he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors on NBC and Peacock ). Luka Doncic is one of the great floor raisers of the game — just having him makes a team competitive — and he enters the season in the best shape of his life and playing with a chip on his shoulder. However, to reach their ceiling in the playoffs, the Lakers will need not only a healthy LeBron but him and Doncic (and Austin Reaves, and Deandre Ayton) on the same page and clicking. Building chemistry takes time and is the one thing delayed by his return. LeBron averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game and was named Second Team All-NBA. LeBron’s historic streak of making 21 consecutive All-NBA teams is in jeopardy this season because, after missing games to start the season, his ability to get to the 65-game cutoff (imposed by the league) is in question.

Moody started the first two preseason games but has since been sidelined by a calf strain. He did not practice on Thursday and will miss the preseason finale Friday night against the Los Angeles Clippers at Chase Center. “I would say Moses is doubtful for the opener,” coach Steve Kerr said. “He just hasn't practiced yet, and we're hoping that he gets on the floor maybe Sunday or Monday. But without enough ramp-up time, he's doubtful for the opener.” With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Moody’s expected absence is a considerable blow to Golden State’s guard/wing rotation. Guard De’Anthony Melton , reconditioning after surgery last December to repair a torn left ACL, will be sidelined until at least November. Both are quality defenders capable of filling the role alongside Stephen Curry in the backcourt. With LA’s Luka Dončić looming on opening night, to whom does Kerr turn? There is no perfect move. Brandin Podziemski has started three of the team’s four preseason games , alongside Curry for two of the three games. He’s an option, but he seems too light to match up with Dončić. Kerr also considers Podziemski his best choice to lead the Warriors’ second unit . Buddy Hield has started alongside Curry in the past and could get consideration this time around. He’s a better physical matchup with Dončić, but such an assignment would come with the risk of early fouls that could limit Hield’s offensive impact. He thrives on offense when coming off the bench and exploiting opposing second units. Gary Payton II could get a look, as his defense could annoy Dončić as well as anyone. But that move would severely cramp Golden State’s floor spacing on offense. Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Would Kerr turn to rookie Will Richard ? Feels like a reach to have someone – anyone – make his NBA debut against an MVP candidate. But Kerr makes it abundantly clear that he believes in Richard , so the possibility can’t be ruled out. “He has great feel,” Kerr said of Richard. “He's a really good cutter. The game flows when he's out there, at both ends. He’s making the right reads and rotations defensively. He’s got a 6-10 wingspan, so he gets his hands on a lot of balls, but it's the reeds that really (stand out).” With the versatility of veteran center Al Horford , a two-big lineup – Horford joined by 7-foot Quinten Post up front – deserves consideration. That, however, would force Draymond Green or Jimmy Butler III to contend with Dončić. There are pros and cons to such a decision. What’s clear is that the Warriors don’t have an ideal defender against Dončić. Neither young Klay Thompson nor experienced Andre Iguodala will be on the floor. Andrew Wiggins, who drew the assignment in recent years, is with the Miami Heat. With five days to go, Kerr and his staff will convene to explore their options and make a decision.

And given the increase in the number of games that will air on broadcast TV, it’s all but inevitable that sales revenues will be up sharply compared to the year-ago period. According to booking data furnished by Guideline, which captures actual agency investment figures from the six major U.S. holding companies as well as most of the large independent shops, total NBA ad spend reached $1.52 billion last season, up 15% versus 2023-24. ABC/ ESPN enjoyed a heady 20% boost in sales volume, while TNT closed out its final season as an NBA media partner with a 9% lift in ad dollars. Under the new suite of rights deals, which includes national coverage across the Disney and NBCUniversal platforms, as well as Amazon ’s Prime Video, the ad dollars are expected to climb even higher. In addition to the NBA’s amped-up broadcast footprint—NBCU will produce 100 regular-season games, with that allotment set to be split evenly between a weekly Tuesday night showcase on the flagship network and an exclusive streaming package via Peacock —pricing is up compared to last fall. In a video interview, Sean Wright, Guideline’s chief insights and analytics officer, said his team anticipates marked revenue growth for the NBA’s media partners, as the boost in the volume of available inventory has coincided with a “healthy increase on the price side.” In other words, “It’s not just that there’s more games on more platforms, it’s that they’re able to charge a little bit more—and those CPM increases are consistent with what we’ve seen over the last few years with the NBA.” Per Guideline, the cost of reaching NBA fans across the league’s TV and streaming partners is up 19% year-over-year. If the upcoming NBA campaign is anything like past seasons, much of the in-game commercial breaks will be stuffed with spots paid for by automakers, fast-food restaurants, retail outlets, movie studios (and their streaming counterparts) and financial services. Not that there’s a whole lot of airtime still up for grabs; as NBC noted earlier this month, nearly all of its in-game NBA inventory was auctioned off during the spring upfront bazaar … although naturally the company is holding a percentage of units back to sell in the scatter market. While the money that comes in via the usual Madison Ave. channels goes a long way toward defraying the cost of carrying the NBA’s games, advertising doesn’t pay the full freight. Per Guideline’s analysis, ad help offset about 50% of most top-tier sports rights fees, with affiliate revenue, retransmission consent fees and other third-party payments accounting for a good chunk of the remainder. Wright said Ad Land’s contribution to paying off the annual rights bill has been remarkably consistent over the last 10 years, holding steady at around that 50% mark despite a range of marketplace disruptions and various spasms at the macroeconomic level. For example, in 2017 U.S. sports ad revenues came in at $9.1 billion, or 51.7% of that same year’s total broadcast rights fees ($17.6 billion). Guideline projects that ad sales in 2026 will climb to $17.1 billion, which works out to 52.1% of the $32.8 billion in rights payouts that will come due next year. As long as sports remains the straw that stirs TV’s drink, the ad dollars will continue to roll right in. Wright estimates that live sports will generate nearly 40% of total ad revenue for the linear TV space in 2025, up sharply from 20% just eight years ago. That’s a function of sports’ stranglehold over linear audiences—recall that sports claimed 93 of the top 100 most-watched broadcasts in the non-Olympic, non-election year that was 2023—and the fact that primetime entertainment continues to lose share to streaming. Per Nielsen live-same-day data, the average network sitcom/drama/unscripted series last season averaged just 414,228 adults 18-49 per episode, which marked a 13% drop compared to the year-ago period and a staggering 24% loss versus the 2022-23 demo deliveries. While it’s too early to get a read on how the new TV season is shaping up, marketers’ enthusiasm for the new-look NBA slate is manifested in not only the elevated pricing and sellout rates, but also by way of all the new sponsors that are in the mix. By NBCU’s reckoning, 20% of their NBA advertisers are first-time buyers of NBC/Peacock inventory, and 10% of its 170 backers are new to the NBA as a whole. NBC and Peacock will set the stage for the season to come on Tuesday night with an inaugural East coast/West coast doubleheader, as the Thunder and Rockets get the ball rolling at 7:30 p.m. ET, followed by Warriors-Lakers at 10:30 p.m. Among the premium backers that’ll be visible during the opener are presenting sponsor (and official NBA automotive booster) Kia and American Express, which has its brand staked to the halftime show. Like Kia, Amex is also a long-time league marketing partner, signing on as the NBA’s official payment services marque in 2010.

A smile – OK, a smirk – lit up his face as he talked about the unforgettable night for several minutes. Little did he know he would experience yet another life-changing moment a few weeks later. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! At Media Day, Murray was asked about where negotiations stood as he entered the final year of his rookie contract . Murray, as expected, kept things simple as he detailed his mindset at the time. “I told my agent, for me, I just don't want to worry about that,” he said. “I told him he can handle the business side, and when I hear from him, or if I see his contact on my phone, I want it to be something important. Murray got that call on Wednesday. The Kings locked up their former No. 4 overall pick for the long haul, agreeing to a five-year, $140 million contract extension with Murray on Wednesday, his agent Mark Bartelstein confirmed to NBC Sports California. Murray, the second-longest tenured King only behind Domantas Sabonis, will remain in Sacramento for the long run. And that’s a win-win for both sides. Since being drafted by Sacramento in 2022, there has been much discussion about whether Murray has lived up to the expectations of a lottery pick. He was off to a convincing start in his rookie season, mostly serving as a 3-point sharpshooter while breaking the NBA’s rookie 3-point record along the way. He also finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting. In the seasons following, his shooting took a dip while his focus shifted to the defensive end of the court. In three seasons with Sacramento, Murray has averaged 13.3 points on 45.1-percent shooting from the field and 37.2 percent from distance, with 5.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 32.5 minutes per game. Within the blink of an eye, Murray has emerged as one of the best 3-and-D wings in the league. And now, with a new contract and the loss of De’Aaron Fox last season, Murray is on a clear one-way path toward becoming the face of the franchise in Sacramento along his trek of reaching two-way stardom potential. “I think you guys know how I feel about Keegan,” coach Doug Christie told reporters before Sacramento’s preseason game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. “Incredibly versatile player. Love him as a person. Just watching him grow up as a young man and watching his game continue to blossom. “From the time I took over, just trying to put air underneath his wings. And let him know that he's highly valued and we truly, truly appreciate him here.” A large part of what’s holding back Murray’s offensive surge falls on Sacramento’s roster construction. He’s had to share the court with players who demand the ball in their hands, taking away and limiting his own touches. It appears that won’t change during the upcoming 2025-26 season. Murray will start alongside Dennis Schroder, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis. A small, and perhaps irrelevant, sample size through a few preseason games shows spacing continues to be an issue for this team – specifically with that lineup. But this move to lock up Murray for at least the next six seasons makes at least one thing clear: the Kings are committed to building this team, the rotations and lineups around Murray. It might not be this season, but it’s becoming more and more evident that’s the end goal. Aside from roster construction, the next step in Murray’s evolution is to be more aggressive offensively . He knows it, his coaches demand it and his teammates encourage it. “A key component to our success is Keegan — on both ends of the ball,” DeRozan told reporters during training camp earlier this month. “We won’t be able to go nowhere if we don’t get the best out of him every single night.” That will be the goal this season and beyond for Sacramento. While speaking to the media for more than 15 minutes during end-of-the-season exit interviews back in April, Murray reflected on his NBA journey thus far. He made it clear that he wasn't disappointed in his third NBA season with the Kings, despite some outside noise critiquing his inability to make a notable and consistent leap. Murray was committed to staying patient, knowing his time would come. \"I've had to fill different roles within the team, now that I think about it, every year,\" Murray said at the time. \"So with me, I think eventually it'll pay off. I know that eventually good things are going to happen. So I'm not worried about anything. \"I know my time is going to come, and whether it's next year, or a couple years after, I know eventually it'll be my time.\" Well, that time is now. And while Sacramento's brass maneuvers through unclear waters, Murray's signing at least gives a loyal Kings fanbase something to look forward to now and in the future as the \"Keegan! Murray!\" chants are here to stay. Download and follow The Deuce & Mo Podcast"}

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 51-31 (lost to the Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals) Offensive rating : 117.3 (5th) Defensive rating : 113.3 (13th) Additions : Guerschon Yabusele, Jordan Clarkson Subtractions : Precious Achiuwa, P.J. Tucker Complete roster The Knicks pulled off somewhat of a stunning upset, ousting the defending champion Boston Celtics in a six-game second-round playoff series. They ran into their ceiling a round later, losing to the fifth-seeded Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals. They defied expectations, only to fall short of them. It is a weird situation. On the one hand, nobody figured them for the league's final four, not with two 60-win teams plying their trade in the East. On the other, they got there and had a real chance to make the Finals. For that, the Knicks decided to part ways with Tom Thibodeau, the coach who got them there. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] There is no doubt that over the course of Thibodeau's tenure the Knicks overachieved. They reached the playoffs in four of his five seasons on the bench, winning four playoff series — more than the franchise's 13 other coaches this century combined. And their best player, Jalen Brunson, is a 6-foot-2 point guard. Brunson also happens to be one hell of a player. He averaged 26 points (49/38/82 shooting splits) and 7.3 assists per game at the helm of a top-five offense, garnering MVP votes for a second straight season. He was incredible in the playoffs, making clutch play after clutch play. How much longer he can maintain this pace as an undersized superstar remains to be seen, but at 29 years old he is squarely in his prime. He is also bolstered by one of the league's best playoff rotations, featuring Karl-Anthony Towns, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Josh Hart and Mitchell Robinson. The additions of Guerschon Yabusele and Jordan Clarkson make the Knicks deeper. With Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton sidelined for the Celtics and Pacers, respectively, New York has as clear a view of the NBA Finals as it has had since 1999. The Knicks saw a chance and took it. Kind of. Upon firing Thibodeau, the Knicks sought interviews with a handful of employed coaches, all of whom turned them down. In the end, they landed on Mike Brown. Brown is a good coach. He took what he learned offensively as an assistant for the 2022 NBA champion Golden State Warriors and applied it to the Sacramento Kings, ending the franchise's 17-year playoff drought. They thought they were better than they were, too, and fired him in the middle of last season. [ Get more Knicks news: New York team feed ] That's the thing. Sometimes it isn't the coach. Sometimes it is the personnel. And the Knicks have not had the personnel to reach the Finals. They have what some might consider a fatal flaw — the defense of Brunson and Towns. Neither is a stopper. Not close to it. Only they have to be on the floor together. And together they submitted a middling defense last year. Can Brown scheme around two defensive issues? More likely, Brown will lean into his team's incredible offensive prowess, using more Brunson-Towns pick-and-rolls and movement in the offense, hoping to squeeze more from what was already a top-five outfit. With Tatum and Haliburton out of the picture and the East's last two champions in a gap year, the path to the Finals is open for the Knicks. They think they have the personnel now, but do they have the coach? Brown coaches the Knicks up as one of the league's elite offenses and finds a way to field a serviceable defense, perhaps benefitting from the presence of Robinson, who missed a good chunk of last season with an injury. Brunson maintains as one of the league's elite playmakers. Towns, who has reached the finals of both conferences the last two years, carries that confidence into this season. Bridges and Anunoby find some consistency as reliable two-way performers, and the Knicks are the class of the East. Brunson steps back from the MVP race. He and Towns cannot scrape together a top-10 defense. Bridges and Anunoby are as inconsistent as ever. Yabusele and Clarkson are not playoff difference-makers. Brown is no better than Thibodeau. The Knicks slam their heads against a sub-Finals ceiling once again, even in a watered-down Eastern Conference, and the outlook for the 2026-27 season is no better. Maybe they take another crack at trying to trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo, but do they have the assets to get him?

Fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus picks five guards who should deliver eye-opening production in Yahoo's new format, High Score. It's fair to say Pritchard enjoyed a breakout campaign last year. However, when factoring in an anticipated surge in usage and production with Jayson Tatum out of commission, his sixth-round ADP seems light. Pritchard averaged 17.9 points with 4.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists with 3 3s in 33 minutes per game with Tatum off the floor last season. Not to say those'll be his numbers this season, but it'll be close. The Celtics offense is built on generating 3s, and Pritchard launches them at one of the highest rates in the NBA. He was 11th in 3-point attempts in 2024-25 and I don't see that shifting when they'll need a village to make up for the usage and volume that typically went to Tatum. In 17 career starts, Pritchard sports a solid 17/5/6 line, so he'll get the counting stats to best last year's 6MOY production. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Mathurin’s aggressiveness is finally being matched with opportunity. He can get hot quickly, and as long as he locks in on defense, he'll be one of those boom players who's ideal for High Score. Mathurin is a strong bet to outperform his ADP in the 9th-10th rounds. Here's why: Pacers HC Rick Carlisle said that Mathurin will start. When playing at least 30 minutes in his career, Mathurin is averaging 20.3 points with 5.9 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. Averaged 35 minutes per game with Tyrese Haliburton off the floor in 2024-25. His scoring increased by nearly 5.5 points per game to 21 ppg with a jump from four to seven free-throw attempts per game. His usage rate climbed 3% to 25% with Haliburton out. There's a chance that Mathurin becomes the Pacers' leading scorer this year and he'll surely be in talks for Most Improved Player with the spike in usage, scoring and opportunity. He's off to a great start in the preseason , leading all Pacers with 18.3 PPG in 17 minutes per game across three contests. Another player where I'd categorize last year's numbers as a mini-breakout, Ivey was well on his way to being in the Most Improved Player conversation until he suffered a broken fibula. The injury cut his season to just 30 games, robbing fantasy managers of a player who was outperforming his draft capital. Now that Ivey is fully recovered from the injury, I'm going back to the well after he's firmly entrenched as the secondary playmaker and scorer for the Pistons. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] He posted a respectable 17/4/4 line last year and with the Eastern Conference thinner, Ivey could push for MIP or possibly an All-Star nod depending on how the Pistons perform. I'm high on his skill set, and in High Score, not having to include turnovers puts him well over 30 fantasy points per game. The upside, however, could peak in the range of 40- 50+ fantasy points, which he did five times last season. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt High Score draft results Nembhard will take on a key playmaking role for the Pacers, averaging 11 points, 6 assists and 3 rebounds in 26 minutes without Haliburton last season. Fantasy managers can comfortably expect his minutes to jump to over 30 per game, especially with reliable backup T.J. McConnell (hamstring) on the shelf for a month. Nembhard is currently being drafted in the seventh round. I think that's too low, considering there aren't many guards available past that point in drafts who can deliver at least six assists with efficiency and steals. He's shown he can take over a game, scoring too, so in High Score, there's more boom potential than you'd expect. With no Haliburton, projecting a career year from the four-year pro is hardly a hot take. There's been no indication that Sheppard will join the starting unit by the beginning of the regular season. That said, I'm not putting too much stock in it. He'll for sure be in the rotation playing more minutes than he ever has in his professional career, with Fred VanVleet (knee) out for the season. That accounts for something. Recognizing that college and the NBA are vastly different situations, Sheppard at least has some history of shooting the ball efficiently and making an impact defensively. The defensive area is where I think he'll win over Rockets HC Ime Udoka and in time, he'll find comfort as a reliable passer and knock-down 3-point shooter. I could be early on this breakout, but there's potential, especially considering he has 25+ minutes coming his way with that amount of talent surrounding him. The second-year guard's impressed over his past two preseason outings, delivering 12.5 points, 3.5 boards, 2.5 assists on 53% shooting from the field and 50% from 3. The Rockets will likely tinker with the lineups depending on the matchups, but Sheppard's poised to make some noise in fantasy this season when he earns that bigger workload."}

Fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus picks five frontcourt breakouts — forwards and centers — who should deliver eye-opening production in Yahoo's new format, High Score . [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Thompson enters the year healthy and ready to dominate after averaging 1.12 fantasy points per minute last season. With elite defense and potential growth in scoring and rebounding, his ADP is climbing as we approach the final big draft weekend. Thompson's moved up from 90 to 80 on Yahoo, and over the past seven days, he's jumped to 77th overall. I've seen Thompson go as high as the fifth round in 12-team leagues, and while I understand the upside, he'll need a substantial leap in scoring alongside his patented defensive and rebounding numbers to reach those heights. But I'm much more willing to bet on Ausar's ascension rather than on Tobias Harris, who is declining while taking some of the usage and volume from Thompson. In terms of pecking order, Jaden Ivey is the main threat to Thompson going off offensively. That said, I'm still banking on the latter outperforming his rising ADP while being firmly in the conversation for Most Improved Player. Thompson is one of 22 players ranked in the top 150 with dual eligibility in High Score, which allows fantasy managers to move him into any roster spot interchangeably. Sharpe steps into a bigger role with Anfernee Simons gone, averaging 27.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 10 games without him last season. Sharpe has looked outstanding in the preseason, sharing primary scoring duties with Deni Avdija. Sharpe's eligible for an extension (that hasn't been granted yet), so there's some financial motivation for him to raise his level of play heading into his fourth NBA season. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] You can only put so much stock into the preseason, but he's been one of the top risers, averaging 19/5/3 with a steal across three games. He's also shot an encouraging 49% from the field and 39% from 3 over that span. There's a ton of upside here and any growth outside of his scoring and displaying his freakish athleticism will produce the best numbers of his career. He's already on pace after putting up career-highs in win shares, usage and assist rates in 2024-25. Like Thompson, Sharpe's dual eligibility also gives him a boost in High Score and across formats. With a new contract, Jović seems to have the edge over Kel'el Ware, offering more playmaking, floor spacing and shotmaking. His draft stock remains very affordable at 132 overall. Coach Erik Spoelstra has prioritized getting Jović more playing time alongside Bam Adebayo. It's an important anecdote because Coach Spo has been singing Jović's praises all offseason, while also publicly challenging Ware's effort and readiness. I remain high on Ware, but Jović's skill set is more conducive to running a functioning offense, especially while Tyler Herro rehabs his ankle injury. Jović averaged a career-high 10.7 points per game in 25 minutes per contest. Still, his true potential lies in utilizing the uptick in minutes to generate more rebounds and assists with another step forward as a scoring threat, capable of delivering 14-15 points per game. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt High Score draft results The Bulls' commitment to Buzelis signals his importance, and he'll start in Year 2 after averaging 13 points, 4 rebounds and 1 block in under 27 minutes as a rookie. With increased minutes, he'll easily justify his 86th overall ADP. I expect his ADP will trend up this weekend as he's showcased his two-way ability for much of the preseason. In four preseason outings, he's been the most consistent scorer for the Bulls, dropping 17 points with 4 rebounds, 2 blocks on 56% shooting from the field, 39% from 3 and 88% from the charity stripe. The runway is clearing for takeoff and, at an eighth round ADP, Buzelis is the right kind of breakout potential to target as you approach the latter part of fantasy drafts. If we're talking about High Score, Sarr is in an ideal position to ball out. First, Washington has no shortage of youth on their team. Even though vets like CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton are there, Sarr doesn't have to compete for minutes like some of the other wings on the team, leaving a sizeable gulf in the frontcourt that Sarr can reliably occupy. The efficiency issues are valid. However, since High Score doesn't factor efficiency into the scoring system, the egregious turnovers and poor shot quality won't register on the fantasy stat sheet. Sarr put up strong numbers in limited action in the preseason too, averaging 12 points with 8 rebounds and 3 stocks per game in just 17 minutes per night. Sarr is entering his second season in the league and is already the team's best defensive anchor. The stocks will be there, plus he averaged 1.08 FPPM as a rookie. Now it's about playing more than 28 minutes a night regularly — which is achievable as long as he can stay out of foul trouble."}

In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Who are the top No. 4 options?", "body": "Manage your account ... Anyone can list the best players in the NBA, but basketball is as much about chemistry as it is talent. Within each of the league's 30 teams is a hierarchy, and how well each of the five players on the court understands and performs his role within that hierarchy is every bit as important as his individual skill. While depth was vital to the success of the Thunder and Pacers last season, and we understand coaches often say, \"It's about who closes the game; not who starts it,\" the pursuit of a roster's most cohesive five-man unit is still paramount. Three of last year's top four starting lineups on our list — the Thunder, Knicks and Timberwolves — reached the conference finals. In this series, we rank each team's starters for a broader look across the league. Ideally, a lineup has its superstar, a deferential co-star, a third star who owns his role, a fourth option and a fifth starter to tie it all together — clear Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. How close does your team come to an ideal lineup? What is a No. 4? Here is how we described him last year ... Generally, he is not a star; if he is, he better be a role player first. And if he is both, then your team is a bear. At the very least, he should be too good to ever deny a starting spot. He can be a table-setter or a rim-runner, but his skills have to complement everyone above him in the pecking order. He can get you 20 points on any given night, but he will not on most, because his defense is of greater import. You cannot be a one-dimensional fourth option, for if you are, your team is likely not very good. It is a funny thing: Nos. 4 and 5 can be comparable in ability, and if they are both good, your team is good. And if they are both not good, your team is not good. It is often here where teams are separated — where delineations become a little clearer and rosters decline a little steeper. And money plays a part in that. You do not want to pay your fourth option a max contract, but you want to pay him what he is worth, and whether he provides value could mean the difference between contending or pretending. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Not bad. But let us add: The NBA's most recent salary restrictions, which include a second apron that acts as a hard cap, actually preclude teams from paying fourth options what they might deserve for any significant period of time. Consider the Celtics, who had to sell off parts from their championship core once the luxury taxes became too punitive. It cost them Jrue Holiday, who was interchangeable as a fourth or fifth option, starring in his role on both ends and never at any point taking away from the team. That reallocation of resources, coinciding with Jayson Tatum's Achilles injury, dropped Boston from the top spot on our overall rankings this season, which we will get to by week's end, and it could come for the Thunder as soon as the end of this season. Value may be the most important aspect of a No. 4, though we will rate them on both their skill and fit. Lastly, we sourced these lineups and each player's status within them with beat reporters around the league. We appreciate everyone who casted a roster; there are too many people to thank in this space. And we recognize that not every player listed here will be in an opening-night starting lineup. Injuries occur. Coaches change their minds. But just know that this is our best guess at the rotations we will likely see most often from each team. We've unveiled our rankings of the top No. 1 , No. 2 and No. 3 options. Without further ado, your five best No. 4s ... The Knicks were not a deep team last season. Nor were they an especially top-heavy roster. They rode a handful of rock-solid players — four of whom will be making more than 20% of the salary cap as soon as next season — to the Eastern Conference finals, ousting the defending champion Celtics in the process. One of those players is Anunoby, who is in the second season of a five-year, $212.5 million contract. That is expensive for a fourth option. It stings less since their best player, Jalen Brunson, took a below-market deal. It stings even less when Anunoby earns his keep, which he did last year, playing the most games of his career, defending all five positions and serving in a more prominent offensive role when called upon. Anunoby can and did do a bit of everything, especially over the final month of last regular season, as injuries winnowed New York's rotation to six or seven reliable players. Over a 20-game stretch, Anunoby averaged a 24-5-3 on 49/42/84 shooting splits, adding 2.7 blocks and steals per game, catapulting the Knicks to the No. 3 seed and a pair of playoff series victories for the first time since the 2000 campaign. He can do more as a playmaker, collecting as many as eight assists in a game (despite his average of 2.2 a night), and the Knicks would surely like to see him be that player more often, but he is predisposed to being a deferential player. That is what they need from their fourth option, who can be interchangeable with Mikal Bridges as a third option . And here's to Anunoby being a little more assertive at the age of 28. Allen is a recent All-Star, making the team for the first and only time in 2022, when he averaged a double-double as a rim-running and -protecting dynamo. He has been the same player over the past four years, posting 15 points (on 66.3% shooting from the field) and 10.2 rebounds per game and finishing as high as 10th in the Defensive Player of the Year race. Allen is one of the best role-playing centers in the league. His frontcourt combination with Evan Mobley — one of the highest-rated second options in the NBA — is devastating on defense. Together they allowed 110.3 points per 100 meaningful possessions, according to Cleaning the Glass , which would have ranked fifth in the league if averaged over the full season. Just as impressively, that combination yielded 121.7 points per 100 non-garbage possessions on offense, which would have led the league. Their net rating as a tandem (+11.5) helped the Cavaliers to 64 wins a year ago. Here's the thing: He can pick-and-roll to the rim, where he converts two-thirds of the time, or he can screen away from the ball, freeing up teammates, and he does not seem to prefer either way. You never have to call a play for Allen, but he will find his way to a nightly double-double one way or another. Last season, we slotted Michael Porter Jr. as a third option on the Nuggets, if only because he imagined himself as such. After all, Porter is one of the league's best shooters, converting 40.6% of his six 3-point attempts per game for his career, and at nearly 7 feet tall that is a serious weapon. His defense was not at the same level, though, and at a cost of $38.3 million this season his salary became a team-building obstacle. So, they flipped him for Johnson, whose $21.1 million salary is more befitting a complementary player. And Johnson is a more willing fourth option, a role he played to some degree on a contender in Phoenix. He is a superior connector to Porter, ceding whatever control necessary to Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon (a more dynamic two-way player than Johnson), while playing superior defense, too. Johnson's shooting is not that far from Porter's, either, as he has shot 39.2% on 5.9 3-point attempts per game in his career. He played as a primary option on the Nets last year, averaging a 19-4-3 on 48/39/89 shooting splits, but he has the basketball IQ to become just as efficient in a smaller role. He is a better fit for the Nuggets, who enter this season with the NBA's second-best title odds , trailing only the defending champion Thunder. Johnson's ability to expand on Porter's role with fewer touches is a big part of that. Surprised to see Flagg so high on this list? He is the only player among this cohort who has a realistic chance at becoming a first option sometime very soon. As is, the Mavericks will ease their No. 1 overall draft pick into the season, slotting him behind veterans Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson and D'Angelo Russell as a fourth option. But there are multiple layers to what Flagg can accomplish this season. He could be undeniable right away, assuming control of this team, even in the presence of Davis, and forcing the Mavericks to reconsider their longterm direction. He could be the connective tissue that ties this team together as a playoff contender in the West, as it bides its time for the return of Kyrie Irving. Either way, he should be very, very good. Remember: Flagg graduated early from high school and announced himself as the best player in college basketball — by far — at the age of 18. He does not turn 19 until four days before Christmas, but he has all the tools in the shed, which makes him equally dangerous as a future first option or a current fourth option. He is, first and foremost, a winning player. The Magic identified Desmond Bane as their third option behind Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner, trading the rights to four first-round draft picks to get him. It was a masterful bit of roster construction, not only because Bane was already one of the league's best third options, but because it pushes Suggs one spot down the pecking order, where his complementary two-way skill set makes him a perfect fit. When last Suggs submitted a healthy season in 2023-24, he made the All-Defensive second team and shot 40% on a handful of 3-point attempts per game. That is him as a player, along with some juice as a playmaker, though he was less efficient as both a shooter and passer last season, when he got injured. Health is a major factor for Suggs. He has missed 117 games over his four-year career. But his recent practice work, which included contact, has him on pace to meet his target return date of the season opener. Here is hoping he can stay healthy, because the acquisition of Bane allows him now to focus on what he does best as one of the league's most dependable 3-and-D role players on a fringe contender. 6.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 50-32 (fourth in the West, lost to the Thunder in the second round) Offensive rating : 118.9 (4th) Defensive rating : 115.1 (21st) Additions: Cameron Johnson, Bruce Brown, Tim Hardaway Jr., Jonas Valančiūnas, Curtis Jones, Tamar Bates Subtractions: Michael Porter Jr., Russell Westbrook, DeAndre Jordan, Dario Šarić, Vlatko Čančar Complete roster See what I did there ? Jokić enters his 11th NBA season broadly, if not universally, acclaimed as the best player on the planet. He is, in the eyes of bookmakers and NBA decision-makers alike, neck-and-neck with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander atop the list of favorites for the 2025-26 NBA Most Valuable Player award … which, if he were to win, would make Jokić just the sixth player ever with four MVP trophies, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James. The big fella has led the Nuggets to 50-plus wins — or, in two COVID-shortened campaigns, a 50-plus-win pace — in six of the last seven seasons. (The one shortfall: 2021-22, when injuries limited Michael Porter Jr. to just nine games and kept Jamal Murray off the court entirely … and Jokić broke Wilt’s all-time record for Player Efficiency Rating , averaged a then-career-high 27.1 points per game, carried Denver to 48 wins and a playoff berth, and won MVP.) That includes last season, when — in a somewhat chaotic campaign that saw both head coach Michael Malone and general manager Calvin Booth get fired just three games before the playoffs — Jokić averaged a triple-double en route to pushing the Nuggets to 50 wins and the No. 4 seed; averaged a triple-double to push the Nuggets past the Clippers in a seven-game Round 1 classic ; and averaged 28-14-6 to push the Thunder to seven games in Round 2 despite, by series’ end, Porter Jr. playing with one arm , Aaron Gordon playing on one leg , and Denver’s bench essentially consisting of Russ and prayers (and, sometimes, prayers for Russ). Jokić’s presence all but guarantees the Nuggets’ floor: 50-ish wins, a top-five offense, a top-five to top-10 net rating, and at worst a puncher’s chance against any opponent they draw in the playoffs. Denver’s ceiling , though, is often determined by his supporting cast. When his teammates — especially playmaking partner Murray and two-way Jack-of-all-trades Gordon — are healthy and humming, the Nuggets can beat anybody. When the help isn’t there, though — especially when Jokić takes a breather — neither are the results. As Tom Haberstroh noted earlier this month on The Big Number , over the last three postseasons, the Nuggets have been outscored by 96 points in 389 minutes with Jokić on the bench — an average of 8.1 points per 100 possessions , and an 11.8-per-100 swing from when he’s been on the court . As confident as he is about lineups featuring Jokić, Murray, Gordon and rising young wing Christian Braun, head coach David Adelman knows that has to change if Denver hopes to get back to competing for titles. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] “I’m not worried about how the starters are going to flow together. It’s just trying to find the right group with that second unit,” Adelman said at Nuggets media day . “[...] We can’t be minus-12 every night in those [non-Jokić] minutes. It’s just a killer. And we rarely blew people out because of that. And when you do that, you run your guys into the ground, and then the playoffs come, and you’re back playing guys 40 minutes a game, and that just can’t be the case.” The new Denver front-office combo of Ben Tenzer and Jon Wallace sought to address that issue over the summer. Out went MPJ (and, crucially, an unprotected 2032 first-round pick) in exchange for Cam Johnson — a deal that saved the Nuggets more than $35 million over the next two seasons, while returning a plus shooter (39% from 3-point land on 7.2 attempts per game) who could bring more off-ball activity, off-the-bounce dynamism and defensive acumen than Porter did. (Fun fact: Going by Taylor Snarr’s estimated plus-minus numbers at Dunks and Threes , Johnson — who finished at +2.4 — ranked better than any single non-Jokić Nugget last season.) The Nuggets then promptly turned the Cam-for-MPJ savings into immediate help. They signed 2023 title winner/franchise favorite Bruce Brown and veteran scoring swingman Tim Hardaway Jr. , adding depth, shooting, secondary playmaking and experience on the wing. They also flipped the little-used Dario Šarić for Jonas Valančiūnas — a bruising, experienced, dependable and productive backup center through whom Adelman can run offense when Jokić is off the floor … and that he can maybe, sometimes, just for fun, play alongside Jokić in twin-towers lineups against some of the other giganto-ball squads the Nuggets might have to knock off in the course of running the Western gauntlet. It’ll be up to Adelman to tinker, mix, match and find the right lineups to not only keep the second units from hemorrhaging points, but maybe even extend the lead on some nights. (Dare to dream!) He looks to have plenty of options, though, between the incoming vets, rising youngsters Julian Strawther and Peyton Watson, and returning 2024 first-round pick DaRon Holmes, who missed all of what would’ve been his rookie season following a ruptured Achilles tendon . [ Get more Nuggets news: Denver team feed ] Questions remain: about Murray’s health, fitness and continued viability as Denver’s No. 2 option ; about how smoothly Johnson will slide into MPJ’s starting small forward slot; about the backup point guard spot behind Murray (can Brown and Jalen Pickett effectively split the duties?); about whether personnel and schematic changes can generate more 3-pointers from an offense that’s ranked dead last in the share of its shots that come from beyond the arc in consecutive seasons ; and, perhaps most importantly, about whether Adelman can turn this collection of players into something better than last season’s bottom-10 defense. (Swapping MPJ and Westbrook for Johnson and Brown could help there .) If those questions wind up having mostly affirmative answers, then the Nuggets should once again find themselves in the running for home-court advantage in the first round of the Western playoffs, feeling like they’ve got the best player in every series they enter — and, this time, a posse to go with him. That’s the sort of combination that gives you a chance to win the whole thing — even with a juggernaut like Oklahoma City standing astride the conference. “They are definitely the hunted one and they’re playing good,” Jokić recently told reporters . “Hopefully we can be the — how do you say it? The silent knight? Silent horse? Dark horse.” See what he did there? Jokić remains the class of the NBA, winning that historic fourth MVP. Murray plays a full healthy season at the level we’ve seen him reach for stretches, finally earning that long-awaited first All-Star berth. Adelman plays the right notes in the second unit, turning what’s long been a glaring weakness into a defined strength. The Nuggets form like Voltron into an absolute war machine, turning in the NBA’s No. 1 offense, winning 60 games, snatching the No. 1 seed away from the Thunder and storming to a second NBA championship. Turns out JV, THJ and Brown aren’t, like, league-shaking additions. Denver’s still good in the regular season, but the same bugaboos persist: Murray starts slow and misses time, the non-Braun young guys don’t pop, and the team still largely bleeds points whenever Jokić sits. The Nuggets struggle to rise above the din in the loud and crowded West, failing to get out of the second round yet again, with all the moves they’ve made ostensibly tantamount to just rearranging deck chairs; the front office starts to think seriously about whether bigger moves are required, and what kind of market they might find for Murray or Gordon. Season opener : Oct. 23 at Golden State Complete schedule I’m not entirely sure that Valančiūnas + Brown + Hardaway = four more wins. Then again, through Jokić, all things are possible, right? Screw it: Let’s go over. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • LA Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

So much has changed since. They weren’t supposed to win a title in 2022 and haven’t made it past the second round of the NBA playoffs since. The Warriors’ core is historically old, and also have the talent and experience to be reawakened as a sleeping giant in a league of parity where a young man’s game is played. There are three avenues the always intriguing Warriors can go down in the upcoming 2025-26 NBA season: Good, bad and great, with questions and answers for all options. Let’s map out how the Warriors can wind up in each final destination. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! This road is a straight shot to right about where the Warriors wound up last season. In this scenario, they finish with between 46 and 49 wins and are anywhere from the No. 8 seed in a loaded Western Conference to the No. 6 seed. They have highs, they have lows and end up as an above average team. The Warriors last season started off red-hot, going 12-3 in their first 15 games. Then they imploded, falling right off a cliff. They also were two different teams in one season. Before the Jimmy Butler trade , the Warriors went through a five-game losing streak, two three-game losing streaks and four two-game losing streaks. After his acquisition, the Warriors had a losing streak – which lasted two games – only once.

To run it back as a similar result to last season, the Warriors’ veterans of Curry, Butler, Draymond Green and Al Horford would be bitten hard enough by the injury bug. Curry in this case is the lone All-Star with Butler either barely missing the cut or not being healthy enough. Their talent and experience is too much, but so are the miles on their bodies. Whether it was home or on the road, the Warriors were the same team last season. Literally. The Warriors were 24-17 at home and 24-17 on the road. But they also were just 5-11 against their Pacific Division foes. The older players are good enough but run into bumps and bruises and can’t always find their second gear on the second night of back-to-backs. The young players make minimal leaps and the Warriors can’t find a good enough upgrade at the trade deadline. Verdict : Unlikely Isn’t this scenario obvious? It all starts with the health of the Warriors’ core four. Horford (39), Curry (37), Butler (36) and Green (35) are all over 35 years old to start the season. Golden State will be rolling out a historically old group, and that always comes with major risk. Curry’s hamstring ended the Warriors’ 2024-25 season the second he began grabbing the back of his leg in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals. The Warriors were 7-5 without Curry in the regular season and then lost four straight games after his injury in the playoffs. They were 6-8 without Green and lost the one regular season game Butler didn’t play for them. But even the younger guys dealt with some injuries, too. Kuminga missed more than two months with a badly sprained ankle . Brandin Podziemski twice missed time and then had to undergo two surgeries in the offseason. Moses Moody missed just a handful of games but also is coming off surgery as well. De’Anthony Melton? He played a grand total of six games for the Warriors and won’t be ready until the first few weeks of November at the very, very earliest. Gary Payton II also always is an injury risk. A Warriors recipe for disaster is major injuries to their stars and older players, at least one bad injury to their younger players and steps backwards from them too. Their win total would be somewhere between 37 and 40 games, fighting to even make the play-in tournament. Verdict : Scary possibility, but unlikely Turn on the film from the moment Butler put on a Warriors jersey and stop right before Curry’s hamstring injury in Minnesota. Now imagine a full season of that team, which is the ride the Warriors are looking to revel in. From an offseason perspective, all the Warriors lost was Kevon Looney, which will be hard to replace in his own right. But they now have Butler from the start, while signing Horford and Seth Curry, and bringing back Melton and Payton. Once Butler arrived, the Warriors, like their newest teammates, found their joy again. The Warriors went 23-8 the rest of the regular season, which in an 82-game season would have them on pace for 61 wins. That win total is probably out of reach but there are reasons the analytics love the Warriors. Most sportsbooks have the Warriors’ over/under at 46.5 wins. One ESPN wins projection has the Warriors winning 56 games, and another ESPN simulation has them winning 63 and making it all the way to the NBA Finals. The goal should be at least 50 wins, which was tied for the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 seeds in the Western Conference last season. Winning that many games would ensure the Warriors wouldn’t have to be in playoff mode starting in early February. It also would mean they start hot out the gates, don’t have extended losing streaks, can withstand back-to-backs, have at least two All-Stars, their young players take major leaps and Kuminga is either too good to trade or brings back the exact player the Warriors need to compete for a title. Quick history lesson: The Warriors have made the Finals every season they have won at least 50 games with Steve Kerr as their head coach. Avoiding the play-in tournament is a must for the Warriors. Finding themselves as a top-four seed with home-court advantage is something the rest of the league doesn’t want to think about. Curry played like his first MVP season after the Butler trade and is as motivated as ever to chase his fifth ring. Compiling between 49 and 55 wins should have him gearing up for 16 playoff wins, and maybe even in the MVP hunt. Verdict : Better than 50/50 chance Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}
