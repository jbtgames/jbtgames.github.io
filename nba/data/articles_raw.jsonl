Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels down through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the entire preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, they are 56-78 (.418)."}

California Highway Patrol officers responded at about 10:40 p.m. to an unrelated car crash involving multiple vehicles on the northbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101, closing four of the six lanes to investigate, the agency said in a news release. When they reopened the lanes about an hour later, they saw a Range Rover SUV stopped in the road, south of the crash. Officers saw Pierce asleep at the wheel and \"noticed signs of alcohol impairment,\" so they conducted a DUI investigation, the press release said. He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, which will be reviewed by the Los Angeles city attorney. Pierce did not immediately respond to a message for comment, and additional contact information for him could not be immediately found. Pierce played for the Boston Celtics for 15 seasons, and most recently for LA Clippers before retiring in 2017. He also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards. The 10-time All-Star and the MVP of the 2008 NBA Finals was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go. It's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day by day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter. \"I've communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love, that the moment I step on this court or in this facility, I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I'm locked into whatever I have in front of me.

The Bucks next host the Pistons on Thursday in Milwaukee. \"I'm locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I'm locked in to this team. I'm locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.\" He went on to compare the offseason to a \"temptation\" period, but now that training camp has started, he's been off social media and focused on his craft. \"It's temptation. That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision.

(1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How much better did Luka Dončić's Lakers get?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-much-better-did-luka-doncics-lakers-get/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T15:52:35+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Lakers, who are in transition", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover.

Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024.

Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , Ayton is the wild card, especially considering his play in the Lakers' first two preseason games. After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31.

[ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer. Fewer shots mean fewer spike games, and that’s detrimental in formats where ceiling outcomes give you the best opportunity to win."}

A fan who spent hundreds of dollars for tickets to what he thought would be one of LeBron James ' final NBA games is looking to recoup the money in small claims court after it turned out \"The Second Decision\" teased by the Lakers superstar had nothing to do with his retirement.

He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat. Garcia said he purchased the tickets within 10 minutes of James' social media post. \"I was like, 'Holy s—, LeBron is going to retire! We've got to get tickets now,'\" the 29-year-old Garcia said. \"Like, literally, because if he formally makes this announcement, you know, there's gonna be some significant price changes, right?\" Read more: Shaikin: Dodgers hope a very, very rested hometown hero can pitch them into NLCS Garcia is a huge fan of the Lakers and James, as well as an avid basketball fan in general, so he thought it would be cool to see the NBA's all-time leading scorer play for the last time against the team he started his career with and brought its first title in 2016 after his return from Miami. \"Moments like that, I understand the value,\" Garcia said. \"There still may be some moderate value [to the tickets], however it's not the same without him retiring. I remember Kobe's last year, it was kind of what this would have been, per se, where every ticket was worth a lot. Every game had value. … \"I missed out on that. I was a little bit younger at the time. I obviously wasn't in a position to where I could just buy tickets unfortunately at that age. I believe I was like 18 or 19 at the time. And that's one of my biggest regrets as a sports fan. I really wish I could have gotten to Kobe's last year. So I see this as a potential to kind of make up for what I lost with Kobe.\" But \"The Second Decision\" ended up having nothing to do with retirement. It was merely a Hennessy ad . So now Garcia wants his money back.

So that's why I was really thinking, 'You know what, this might be grounds for a case.'\" A trial date has been set for Dec. 1. The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though. Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters at practice Tuesday that the organization hadn't been at all concerned about the meaning behind James' post the previous day.

Garcia said he didn't care what others might think about him jumping to the wrong conclusion or his effort to recoup the funds he spent after doing so. \"If I was the type of individual that was bothered by people's comments or reactions, would I have filed a small-claims lawsuit against LeBron James?\" Garcia said. \"I'm getting reactions. I mean, have you read some of these social media comments? I don't care. I am a very chill guy. ... I'm getting set to take on one of the most famous people in the world. I know what comes with that.\" In light of everything that has happened this week, though, Garcia said he'd still be willing to pay the same amount of money to see James play during his eventual retirement tour. \"Of course,\" Garcia said. \"I would probably spend more, because life is all about memories and experiences.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over. (Just not, like, as an actual bet with actual money.) East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26. Patrick Ewing (11,607) (James grabbed 546 rebounds last season. He trails Rodman by 223.) 1. John Stockton (15,806) 2. Chris Paul (12,499) 3. Jason Kidd (12,091) 4. LeBron James (11,584) 5. Steve Nash (10,335) (James doled out 575 assists last season. He trails Kidd by 507.) 3. Jason Kidd (2,684) 4. Michael Jordan (2,514) 5. Gary Payton (2,445) 6. LeBron James (2,345) 7. Maurice Cheeks (2,310) (James swiped 70 steals last season. He trails Payton by 100.) 4. Damian Lillard (2,804) 5. Klay Thompson (2,697) 6. Reggie Miller (2,560) 7. LeBron James (2,559) 8. Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets.

Fantasy basketball season is here, and the best way to prep for your drafts is to mock, mock again and mock some more! Drafting out of the No. 12 spot in a 12-team, 9-cat league offers the benefit of back-to-back picks to start your build, but it comes with its own set of challenges. The top-tier players have been selected, and your two picks will be the only ones you have until your next two picks nearly two full rounds later. I completed a mock drafting from this spot to show how it might play out. Here are the results and brief analysis. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , 1. Nikola Jokić (DEN - C) 2. Victor Wembanyama (SAS - C) 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL - PF,C) 4. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC - PG) 5. Luka Dončić (LAL - PG,SG) 6.

Jalen Johnson (ATL - SF,PF) Drafting from the 12 spot with back-to-back picks, my options are wide open, but there is some strategy involved here. With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27. Scottie Barnes (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 28. Jaylen Brown (BOS - SG,SF) 29. Josh Giddey (CHI - PG,SG) 30. Pascal Siakam (IND - PF,C) 31. Jamal Murray (DEN - PG,SG) 32. Bam Adebayo (MIA - PF,C) 33. Derrick White (BOS - PG,SG) 34. Franz Wagner (ORL - SF,PF) 35. Ivica Zubac (LAC - C) 36. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 37. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 38. De'Aaron Fox (SAS - PG,SG) 39. Desmond Bane (ORL - SG,SF) 40. Trey Murphy III (NOP - SF,PF) 41. Jaren Jackson Jr. (MEM - PF,C) 42. Kawhi Leonard (LAC - SF,PF) 43. Dyson Daniels (ATL - PG,SG,SF) 44. Deni Avdija (POR - SF,PF) 45. Jimmy Butler III (GSW - SF,PF) 46. Ja Morant (MEM - PG) 47. Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 48. Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56. DeMar DeRozan (SAC - SF) 57. Josh Hart (NYK - SG,SF,PF) 58. Jalen Duren (DET - C) 59. Walker Kessler (UTA - C) 60. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 61. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 62. Jarrett Allen (CLE - C) 63. Zach LaVine (SAC - PG,SG) 64. Darius Garland (CLE - PG) 65. Coby White (CHI - PG,SG) 66. Paul George (PHI - SG,SF,PF) 67. Payton Pritchard (BOS - PG) 68. OG Anunoby (NYK - SF,PF) 69. Brandon Ingram (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 70. Isaiah Hartenstein (OKC - C) 71. Rudy Gobert (MIN - C) 72. Immanuel Quickley (TOR - PG,SG) The purpose of mock drafts is to learn. Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76. Julius Randle (MIN - PF,C) 77. Michael Porter Jr. (BKN - SF,PF) 78. Norman Powell (MIA - SG,SF) 79. Anfernee Simons (BOS - PG,SG) 80. Bradley Beal (LAC - SG,SF) 81. Jrue Holiday (POR - PG,SG) 82. Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 83. Jalen Green (PHX - PG,SG) 84. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 85. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 86. Christian Braun (DEN - SG,SF) 87. Donovan Clingan (POR - C) 88. Matas Buzelis (CHI - SF,PF) 89. Mark Williams (PHX - C) 90. Bennedict Mathurin (IND - SG,SF) 91. Cameron Johnson (DEN - SF,PF) 92. John Collins (LAC - PF,C) 93. RJ Barrett (TOR - SF,PF) 94. Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (ATL - SG,SF) 111. Keegan Murray (SAC - SF,PF) 112. Dereck Lively II (DAL - C) 113. CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) 114. Zach Edey (MEM - C) 115. Aaron Gordon (DEN - PF,C) 116. Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night. Adding that nearly double-digit rebound total and 2.7 stocks per game could have Thompson looking like a top-10 player this season. Other Players in Consideration: Tyrese Maxey, PHI (ADP: 19.9) Alperen Sengun, HOU (ADP: 19.6) Evan Mobley, CLE (ADP: 20.1) LaMelo Ball (ADP: 29.7)"}

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told The Athletic's Nick Friedell in an exclusive interview. “How can I have their trust? And they can go to [owner] Joe [Lacob] and [general manager] Mike [Dunleavy] and be like, “Hey, we want to leave it with him. He’s going to continue what we’re leaving. \"So, I think about that all time, and I set myself up in that position to have that. And there’s a lot of other things than just skill that you need to be in that position.” There has been much chatter about life after Steph, and what that could look like. Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The light that gauges the effectiveness of their perimeter defense, particularly at the point of attack. That element is one of several essentials to Golden State’s success, and it has been considerably less than stellar. Opposing guards, some speedy and others shifty, are penetrating with regularity, resulting in paint points, free throws or kickouts to open shooters behind the arc. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! That was visible Wednesday night in the first half – with all minutes going to starters and rotation players – of a 129-123 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. It took a massive fourth-quarter comeback by the far end of the bench to wipe out a 16-point halftime deficit. Moses Moody started in the role of primary POA defender against Portland, with coach Steve Kerr pairing him with Stephen Curry in the backcourt. This vulnerability also was visible last Sunday, when Brandin Podziemski started alongside Curry in a 111-103 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. While it’s unreasonable to expect fantastic defense in the first week of the preseason, the Warriors can’t be delighted with a defense that allowed 39 points in the first quarter and 73 in the half. “They were flying by us,” Kerr said. “And then we were collapsing, probably too much. And then they had a ton of threes. I think they made 10 threes in the first half.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Wrong, coach. The Blazers drained 12 triples in the first half. They also posted a 24-16 edge in paint points. This was Golden State’s first look at a starting lineup that might start the 2025-26 NBA regular season. Curry and Moody in the backcourt, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at forward and Al Horford at center . All five posted negative plus/minus numbers in the first half. “I didn’t think we were ready to play,” Kerr said. “I don’t know that we got a good enough look at that lineup to really know. It should fit, with Al’s shooting and we have a lot of length. Moses on the ball. They took it to us right away.” Starting Moody against the Blazers was logical because he’s a rangy defender (6-foot-5, 7-foot wingspan) and a good 3-point shooter. The possibility of him as lead bird dog emerged late last season, after the Warriors traded Andrew Wiggins as part of the deal to acquire Jimmy Butler III, as Kerr explained before tipoff. “He got to guard the ball,” Kerr recalled of Moody. “He got to be in the starting lineup, and he became our point of attack defender, like Wiggs was before. And so, with Wiggs leaving, that opened a void on this team, because Jimmy's not that.” Moody has the potential to be all of that, but it’s clear he’s still trying to master the art of staying in front of quick guards. It’s a tough assignment. He has made 74 starts over four NBA seasons, but starring in that role took Klay Thompson about 300 starts. “They came out and hit us early,” Moody told NBC Sports Bay Area. “It felt like a different game than [against the Lakers]. \"We didn’t do much game planning and preparation. But I think their speed, especially in transition, got us.” Portland guard Shaedon Sharpe finished with a game-high 22 points in 23 minutes, on 9-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-8 from deep. He was plus-14 for the night. Backup guard Blake Wesley, blasting into the paint with relative ease, finished with nine points and six rebounds. Three nights earlier, four Lakers scored in double figures on Sunday – and all were guards: Gabe Vincent (team-high 16 points), Dalton Knecht (12), R.J. Davis (11) and Jack LaRavia (10). Along with their 49 combined points, they accounted for 12 assists. Golden State’s POA defense so important because there is no Victor Wembanyama waiting at the rim. There is no Anthony Davis or Rudy Gobert or Chet Holmgren. Not even a Donovan Clingan The preseason is a time for experimenting, for seeing what might work and what shouldn’t even be tried. It’s a work in progress, and there is plenty of time to patch it. But the early returns are worth watching. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Warriors again play the Blazers in the preseason next Tuesday, as well as the third game of the 2025-26 NBA regular season in what will be the second night of a back-to-back. Here are three takeaways from the Warriors’ second win to start their five-game preseason schedule. After opening the preseason with a small-ball lineup in the Warriors' first game , coach Steve Kerr switched gears and went big against the Blazers. Al Horford moved into the starting lineup, with the real decision being Moses Moody staying and Brandin Podziemski coming off the bench. Horford and Moody accompanied Curry, Butler and Green. “Al gives us the ability to play bigger with shooting,” Kerr explained at his pregame press conference. “Portland’s got a pretty big team and I would anticipate they’ll start [Donovan] Clingan. I think I mentioned last game, I don’t want to throw Draymond out there constantly against these big centers. So this is a good night to take a look at that lineup and see what we do.” The Warriors trailed 18-15 when Kerr first turned to his bench, replacing Moody and Horford with Buddy Hield and Post with a little more than five minutes left in the first quarter. Moody blocked two shots in the first minute, and Horford already had two rebounds and one assist. He should have had two assists by then if Moody would have converted an open layup. But Horford’s first assist was an eye-opening dime. The 39-year-old center grabbed a defensive rebound and went coast-to-coast, finding Butler in transition for an easy layup at the rim. Al Horford doing this as a 39-year-old center is absurd pic.twitter.com/UCi79KK6Br The starters didn’t play together again all night. Like the preseason opener, Curry, Butler, Green and Horford all sat the second half. Horford was scoreless in 11 minutes while missing his four shot attempts. Moody didn’t start the second half and was a minus-10 in 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. Once Kerr turned to his bench, the game flipped in favor of the Blazers. The Warriors used a 10-man rotation in the first quarter, using Podziemski, Hield, Post, Jonathan Kuminga and Gary Payton II off the bench. That unit lost its run 19-4 in the first quarter alone. The Blazers’ bench outscored the Warriors’ reserves 18-7 in the first quarter, and Portland went on a 13-0 run to hold a 14-point 39-25 lead going into the second quarter. By halftime, the Warriors were losing the bench battle 25-20. All of the Warriors’ bench players had a negative plus/minus, and Deni Avdija, who was up to 13 points, was the lone Blazers bench player in the negative. Seth Curry eventually will be an option off the bench for Kerr, and should at least provide more outside shooting. Curry “is still ramping up,” per Kerr, and has yet to play in the preseason. He will be waived by Oct. 18 and is eligible to be re-signed starting Nov. 11. Podziemski and Kuminga each were a game-low minus-17. If Toumani Camara starts making threes like he did against the Warriors, the rest of the league could have a problem on its hands. The Second Team All-Defensive selection from last season was part of the reason the Warriors were buried from long distance on their home court. Camara went 4 of 7 from 3-point range in the first half before missing his two attempts in the second half. Shaedon Sharpe also was 4 of 7 beyond the arc in the first half as the Blazers went 12 of 28 on threes through the first two quarters. The Warriors were losing the long distance battle, and were being beaten by speed. Most of the Blazers’ threes were open shots, and the Warriors were late to rotate. The Blazers shot 46.3 percent in the first half, including a 42.9 3-point percentage. The Warriors also only had two steals compared to six by the Blazers going into halftime, and they turned the ball over three times more than them – 12 to three. Effort and resiliency from the back of the bench deserves tons of positivity. First, the defensive miscues will have to be cleaned up ahead of Sunday’s game in LA against the Lakers.

Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels down through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the entire preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, they are 56-78 (.418)."}

California Highway Patrol officers responded at about 10:40 p.m. to an unrelated car crash involving multiple vehicles on the northbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101, closing four of the six lanes to investigate, the agency said in a news release. When they reopened the lanes about an hour later, they saw a Range Rover SUV stopped in the road, south of the crash. Officers saw Pierce asleep at the wheel and \"noticed signs of alcohol impairment,\" so they conducted a DUI investigation, the press release said. He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, which will be reviewed by the Los Angeles city attorney. Pierce did not immediately respond to a message for comment, and additional contact information for him could not be immediately found. Pierce played for the Boston Celtics for 15 seasons, and most recently for LA Clippers before retiring in 2017. He also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards. The 10-time All-Star and the MVP of the 2008 NBA Finals was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision.

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later.

For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League. He is set to back up DeMar DeRozan , so presumably he wouldn't get enough minutes early on, but he's another free agent I'll have my eye on once the season begins.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year odds, picks: Best bets, from favorites to long shots", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-sixth-man-of-the-year-odds-picks-best-bets-from-favorites-to-long-shots/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T14:55:07+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "The Sixth Man of the Year race will be wide open in the 2025-26 season", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "Rockets' Kevin Durant opens up about possible reunion with ex-teammate Russell Westbrook: 'It would be dope'", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-kevin-durant-opens-up-about-possible-reunion-with-ex-teammate-russell-westbrook-it-would-be-dope/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T16:40:18+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 season, Westbrook remains a free agent", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How much better did Luka Dončić's Lakers get?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-much-better-did-luka-doncics-lakers-get/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T15:52:35+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Lakers, who are in transition", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Boston Celtics great Paul Pierce was reportedly arrested under suspicion of DUI in Los Angeles on Tuesday, California Highway Patrol told multiple news stations in California and Boston. Pierce, 47, was reportedly found sleeping behind the wheel of his car on a Los Angeles freeway after 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover. Officers claimed they noticed signs of impairment from Pierce and began a DUI investigation. He was arrested under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Pierce's case will be \"presented to the Los Angeles City Attorney for review,\" per WCVB. While Pierce spent nearly his entire NBA career in Boston, he was born — and grew up — in California. Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers.

James, 40, signed a new contract with the Lakers in June and is set to become the first player to play across 23 separate NBA seasons. Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career. His tally of 1,562 regular-season appearances is just 50 short of breaking former Boston Celtics star Robert Parish's NBA record. The four-time NBA champion featured in 70 of the Lakers' 82 games last term and played on 71 occasions in the year before.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , Ayton is the wild card, especially considering his play in the Lakers' first two preseason games. After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31. If the injury requires more time to heal, or James needs a few days to get back up to speed, he's at risk of missing even more time as he recovers from the injury. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer.

A fan who spent hundreds of dollars for tickets to what he thought would be one of LeBron James ' final NBA games is looking to recoup the money in small claims court after it turned out \"The Second Decision\" teased by the Lakers superstar had nothing to do with his retirement. Norwalk resident Andrew Garcia filed a claim Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court that states that James owes him $865.66 because of \"fraud, deception, misrepresentation, and any and all basis of legal recovery.\" Read more: Plaschke: LeBron James is 'maybe' retiring? This is going to be fun Garcia told The Times that he spent that amount for two tickets to the Lakers' game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 31, 2026, at Crypto.com Arena, thinking it would be the 40-year-old NBA icon's final game against the team that drafted him in 2003. He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat. Garcia said he purchased the tickets within 10 minutes of James' social media post. \"I was like, 'Holy s—, LeBron is going to retire! We've got to get tickets now,'\" the 29-year-old Garcia said. \"Like, literally, because if he formally makes this announcement, you know, there's gonna be some significant price changes, right?\" Read more: Shaikin: Dodgers hope a very, very rested hometown hero can pitch them into NLCS Garcia is a huge fan of the Lakers and James, as well as an avid basketball fan in general, so he thought it would be cool to see the NBA's all-time leading scorer play for the last time against the team he started his career with and brought its first title in 2016 after his return from Miami. \"Moments like that, I understand the value,\" Garcia said. \"There still may be some moderate value [to the tickets], however it's not the same without him retiring. I remember Kobe's last year, it was kind of what this would have been, per se, where every ticket was worth a lot. Every game had value. … \"I missed out on that. I was a little bit younger at the time. I obviously wasn't in a position to where I could just buy tickets unfortunately at that age. I believe I was like 18 or 19 at the time. And that's one of my biggest regrets as a sports fan. I really wish I could have gotten to Kobe's last year. So I see this as a potential to kind of make up for what I lost with Kobe.\" But \"The Second Decision\" ended up having nothing to do with retirement. It was merely a Hennessy ad . So now Garcia wants his money back. Read more: Natalia Bryant makes her debut as a creative director with Lakers short film \"There is no circumstance absent him saying he's gonna retire that I would have bought tickets that far in advance,\" Garcia said. \"I mean, I buy tickets, but I don't buy tickets five months in advance. I'm the kind of person that buys tickets five hours in advance. It was solely, solely, solely based on that. So that's why I was really thinking, 'You know what, this might be grounds for a case.'\" A trial date has been set for Dec. 1. The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though. Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters at practice Tuesday that the organization hadn't been at all concerned about the meaning behind James' post the previous day. Read more: Hernández: Why has Shohei Ohtani gone missing at the plate for the Dodgers? \"We all knew it was an ad,\" Redick said . Garcia said he didn't care what others might think about him jumping to the wrong conclusion or his effort to recoup the funds he spent after doing so. \"If I was the type of individual that was bothered by people's comments or reactions, would I have filed a small-claims lawsuit against LeBron James?\" Garcia said. \"I'm getting reactions. I mean, have you read some of these social media comments? I don't care. I am a very chill guy. ... I'm getting set to take on one of the most famous people in the world. I know what comes with that.\" In light of everything that has happened this week, though, Garcia said he'd still be willing to pay the same amount of money to see James play during his eventual retirement tour. \"Of course,\" Garcia said. \"I would probably spend more, because life is all about memories and experiences.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over. (Just not, like, as an actual bet with actual money.) East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26.

Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets. Stephen Curry (25,386 career points) could climb as high as 13th (27,313) on the all-time list. Nikola Jokić needs 18 triple-doubles to surpass Oscar Robertson for second on the all-time list. Klay Thompson needs 277 3-pointers to surpass Ray Allen for third on the all-time list. Paul George needs 102 3-pointers to surpass Kyle Korver for eighth on the all-time list. Durant needs 100 3-pointers to surpass Vince Carter for 10th on the all-time list. Chris Paul needs 57 games played to surpass Jason Terry for 10th on the all-time list. Rudy Gobert needs 300 rebounds to become the 45th player ever to reach 10,000 for his career. Anthony Davis needs 185 blocks to become the 21st player ever to reach 2,000 for his career. Davis and George need 1,022 points and 1,303 points, respectively, to reach 20,000 for their careers."}

With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27.

Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56.

Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76.

Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110.

Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night.

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told The Athletic's Nick Friedell in an exclusive interview. “How can I have their trust? And they can go to [owner] Joe [Lacob] and [general manager] Mike [Dunleavy] and be like, “Hey, we want to leave it with him. He’s going to continue what we’re leaving. \"So, I think about that all time, and I set myself up in that position to have that. And there’s a lot of other things than just skill that you need to be in that position.” There has been much chatter about life after Steph, and what that could look like. Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The light that gauges the effectiveness of their perimeter defense, particularly at the point of attack. That element is one of several essentials to Golden State’s success, and it has been considerably less than stellar. Opposing guards, some speedy and others shifty, are penetrating with regularity, resulting in paint points, free throws or kickouts to open shooters behind the arc. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! That was visible Wednesday night in the first half – with all minutes going to starters and rotation players – of a 129-123 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. It took a massive fourth-quarter comeback by the far end of the bench to wipe out a 16-point halftime deficit. Moses Moody started in the role of primary POA defender against Portland, with coach Steve Kerr pairing him with Stephen Curry in the backcourt. This vulnerability also was visible last Sunday, when Brandin Podziemski started alongside Curry in a 111-103 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. While it’s unreasonable to expect fantastic defense in the first week of the preseason, the Warriors can’t be delighted with a defense that allowed 39 points in the first quarter and 73 in the half. “They were flying by us,” Kerr said. “And then we were collapsing, probably too much. And then they had a ton of threes. I think they made 10 threes in the first half.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Wrong, coach. The Blazers drained 12 triples in the first half. They also posted a 24-16 edge in paint points. This was Golden State’s first look at a starting lineup that might start the 2025-26 NBA regular season. Curry and Moody in the backcourt, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at forward and Al Horford at center . All five posted negative plus/minus numbers in the first half. “I didn’t think we were ready to play,” Kerr said. “I don’t know that we got a good enough look at that lineup to really know. It should fit, with Al’s shooting and we have a lot of length. Moses on the ball. They took it to us right away.” Starting Moody against the Blazers was logical because he’s a rangy defender (6-foot-5, 7-foot wingspan) and a good 3-point shooter. The possibility of him as lead bird dog emerged late last season, after the Warriors traded Andrew Wiggins as part of the deal to acquire Jimmy Butler III, as Kerr explained before tipoff. “He got to guard the ball,” Kerr recalled of Moody. “He got to be in the starting lineup, and he became our point of attack defender, like Wiggs was before. And so, with Wiggs leaving, that opened a void on this team, because Jimmy's not that.” Moody has the potential to be all of that, but it’s clear he’s still trying to master the art of staying in front of quick guards. It’s a tough assignment. He has made 74 starts over four NBA seasons, but starring in that role took Klay Thompson about 300 starts. “They came out and hit us early,” Moody told NBC Sports Bay Area. “It felt like a different game than [against the Lakers]. \"We didn’t do much game planning and preparation. But I think their speed, especially in transition, got us.” Portland guard Shaedon Sharpe finished with a game-high 22 points in 23 minutes, on 9-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-8 from deep. He was plus-14 for the night. Backup guard Blake Wesley, blasting into the paint with relative ease, finished with nine points and six rebounds. Three nights earlier, four Lakers scored in double figures on Sunday – and all were guards: Gabe Vincent (team-high 16 points), Dalton Knecht (12), R.J. Davis (11) and Jack LaRavia (10). Along with their 49 combined points, they accounted for 12 assists. Golden State’s POA defense so important because there is no Victor Wembanyama waiting at the rim. There is no Anthony Davis or Rudy Gobert or Chet Holmgren. Not even a Donovan Clingan The preseason is a time for experimenting, for seeing what might work and what shouldn’t even be tried. It’s a work in progress, and there is plenty of time to patch it. But the early returns are worth watching. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Warriors again play the Blazers in the preseason next Tuesday, as well as the third game of the 2025-26 NBA regular season in what will be the second night of a back-to-back. Here are three takeaways from the Warriors’ second win to start their five-game preseason schedule. After opening the preseason with a small-ball lineup in the Warriors' first game , coach Steve Kerr switched gears and went big against the Blazers. Al Horford moved into the starting lineup, with the real decision being Moses Moody staying and Brandin Podziemski coming off the bench. Horford and Moody accompanied Curry, Butler and Green. “Al gives us the ability to play bigger with shooting,” Kerr explained at his pregame press conference. “Portland’s got a pretty big team and I would anticipate they’ll start [Donovan] Clingan. I think I mentioned last game, I don’t want to throw Draymond out there constantly against these big centers. So this is a good night to take a look at that lineup and see what we do.” The Warriors trailed 18-15 when Kerr first turned to his bench, replacing Moody and Horford with Buddy Hield and Post with a little more than five minutes left in the first quarter. Moody blocked two shots in the first minute, and Horford already had two rebounds and one assist. He should have had two assists by then if Moody would have converted an open layup. But Horford’s first assist was an eye-opening dime. The 39-year-old center grabbed a defensive rebound and went coast-to-coast, finding Butler in transition for an easy layup at the rim. Al Horford doing this as a 39-year-old center is absurd pic.twitter.com/UCi79KK6Br The starters didn’t play together again all night. Like the preseason opener, Curry, Butler, Green and Horford all sat the second half. Horford was scoreless in 11 minutes while missing his four shot attempts. Moody didn’t start the second half and was a minus-10 in 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. Once Kerr turned to his bench, the game flipped in favor of the Blazers. The Warriors used a 10-man rotation in the first quarter, using Podziemski, Hield, Post, Jonathan Kuminga and Gary Payton II off the bench. That unit lost its run 19-4 in the first quarter alone. The Blazers’ bench outscored the Warriors’ reserves 18-7 in the first quarter, and Portland went on a 13-0 run to hold a 14-point 39-25 lead going into the second quarter. By halftime, the Warriors were losing the bench battle 25-20. All of the Warriors’ bench players had a negative plus/minus, and Deni Avdija, who was up to 13 points, was the lone Blazers bench player in the negative. Seth Curry eventually will be an option off the bench for Kerr, and should at least provide more outside shooting. Curry “is still ramping up,” per Kerr, and has yet to play in the preseason. He will be waived by Oct. 18 and is eligible to be re-signed starting Nov. 11. Podziemski and Kuminga each were a game-low minus-17. If Toumani Camara starts making threes like he did against the Warriors, the rest of the league could have a problem on its hands. The Second Team All-Defensive selection from last season was part of the reason the Warriors were buried from long distance on their home court. Camara went 4 of 7 from 3-point range in the first half before missing his two attempts in the second half. Shaedon Sharpe also was 4 of 7 beyond the arc in the first half as the Blazers went 12 of 28 on threes through the first two quarters. The Warriors were losing the long distance battle, and were being beaten by speed. Most of the Blazers’ threes were open shots, and the Warriors were late to rotate. The Blazers shot 46.3 percent in the first half, including a 42.9 3-point percentage. The Warriors also only had two steals compared to six by the Blazers going into halftime, and they turned the ball over three times more than them – 12 to three. Effort and resiliency from the back of the bench deserves tons of positivity. First, the defensive miscues will have to be cleaned up ahead of Sunday’s game in LA against the Lakers.

Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, the Lakers are 56-78 (.418)."}

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

Antetokounmpo's comments came in the wake of a report by ESPN's Shams Charania earlier this week that the Bucks engaged in trade discussions with the New York Knicks this offseason about a potential deal for the two-time MVP. Although Antetokounmpo acknowledged that he had not read the report, he again doubled down on his desire to compete for championships -- be it in Milwaukee or elsewhere. \"I've said this many times: I want to be in a situation that I can win,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go. It's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day by day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter. \"I've communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love, that the moment I step on this court or in this facility, I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I'm locked into whatever I have in front of me. Now, if in six, seven months I change my mind, I think that's human, too.\" After missing the beginning of training camp in Milwaukee with an illness, Antetokounmpo rejoined the team this past weekend in Miami before its first preseason game Sunday, although he did not play. The Bucks next host the Pistons on Thursday in Milwaukee. \"I'm locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I'm locked in to this team. I'm locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.\" He went on to compare the offseason to a \"temptation\" period, but now that training camp has started, he's been off social media and focused on his craft. \"It's temptation. That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision. And my decision today is that I'm here and I'm committed to this team.\""}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN.

For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Create or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today! Sign up today! Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League. He is set to back up DeMar DeRozan , so presumably he wouldn't get enough minutes early on, but he's another free agent I'll have my eye on once the season begins.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year odds, picks: Best bets, from favorites to long shots", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-sixth-man-of-the-year-odds-picks-best-bets-from-favorites-to-long-shots/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T14:55:07+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "The Sixth Man of the Year race will be wide open in the 2025-26 season", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Boston Celtics great Paul Pierce was reportedly arrested under suspicion of DUI in Los Angeles on Tuesday, California Highway Patrol told multiple news stations in California and Boston. Pierce, 47, was reportedly found sleeping behind the wheel of his car on a Los Angeles freeway after 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover. Officers claimed they noticed signs of impairment from Pierce and began a DUI investigation. He was arrested under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Pierce's case will be \"presented to the Los Angeles City Attorney for review,\" per WCVB. While Pierce spent nearly his entire NBA career in Boston, he was born — and grew up — in California. Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024. He found himself in the headlines in May, when he walked 20 miles to work after a bold prediction about the Celtics backfired."}

James, 40, signed a new contract with the Lakers in June and is set to become the first player to play across 23 separate NBA seasons. Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career. His tally of 1,562 regular-season appearances is just 50 short of breaking former Boston Celtics star Robert Parish's NBA record. The four-time NBA champion featured in 70 of the Lakers' 82 games last term and played on 71 occasions in the year before. Last season, James averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds per game and finished sixth in Most Valuable Player vote. The Lakers qualified for the play-offs in 2024-25 but lost 4-1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side.

Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31. If the injury requires more time to heal, or James needs a few days to get back up to speed, he's at risk of missing even more time as he recovers from the injury. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves. With James sidelined to start the 2025-26 NBA season, Dončić will look to carry an even bigger load early in the schedule."}

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer. Fewer shots mean fewer spike games, and that’s detrimental in formats where ceiling outcomes give you the best opportunity to win."}

He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat.

The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players. This report comes just days after USA Basketball announced that Duke coach Kara Lawson will coach the USA women’s national team for the next Olympic cycle and the Los Angeles Games.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over.

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26.

Maurice Cheeks (2,310) (James swiped 70 steals last season. He trails Payton by 100.) 4. Damian Lillard (2,804) 5. Klay Thompson (2,697) 6. Reggie Miller (2,560) 7. LeBron James (2,559) 8. Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets. Stephen Curry (25,386 career points) could climb as high as 13th (27,313) on the all-time list. Nikola Jokić needs 18 triple-doubles to surpass Oscar Robertson for second on the all-time list. Klay Thompson needs 277 3-pointers to surpass Ray Allen for third on the all-time list. Paul George needs 102 3-pointers to surpass Kyle Korver for eighth on the all-time list. Durant needs 100 3-pointers to surpass Vince Carter for 10th on the all-time list. Chris Paul needs 57 games played to surpass Jason Terry for 10th on the all-time list. Rudy Gobert needs 300 rebounds to become the 45th player ever to reach 10,000 for his career. Anthony Davis needs 185 blocks to become the 21st player ever to reach 2,000 for his career. Davis and George need 1,022 points and 1,303 points, respectively, to reach 20,000 for their careers."}

Jalen Johnson (ATL - SF,PF) Drafting from the 12 spot with back-to-back picks, my options are wide open, but there is some strategy involved here. With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27. Scottie Barnes (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 28. Jaylen Brown (BOS - SG,SF) 29. Josh Giddey (CHI - PG,SG) 30. Pascal Siakam (IND - PF,C) 31. Jamal Murray (DEN - PG,SG) 32. Bam Adebayo (MIA - PF,C) 33.

Jimmy Butler III (GSW - SF,PF) 46. Ja Morant (MEM - PG) 47. Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 48. Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56.

Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76. Julius Randle (MIN - PF,C) 77. Michael Porter Jr. (BKN - SF,PF) 78. Norman Powell (MIA - SG,SF) 79. Anfernee Simons (BOS - PG,SG) 80. Bradley Beal (LAC - SG,SF) 81. Jrue Holiday (POR - PG,SG) 82. Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 83. Jalen Green (PHX - PG,SG) 84. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 85. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 86. Christian Braun (DEN - SG,SF) 87. Donovan Clingan (POR - C) 88. Matas Buzelis (CHI - SF,PF) 89. Mark Williams (PHX - C) 90. Bennedict Mathurin (IND - SG,SF) 91. Cameron Johnson (DEN - SF,PF) 92. John Collins (LAC - PF,C) 93. RJ Barrett (TOR - SF,PF) 94. Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (ATL - SG,SF) 111. Keegan Murray (SAC - SF,PF) 112. Dereck Lively II (DAL - C) 113. CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) 114. Zach Edey (MEM - C) 115. Aaron Gordon (DEN - PF,C) 116. Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night. Adding that nearly double-digit rebound total and 2.7 stocks per game could have Thompson looking like a top-10 player this season. Other Players in Consideration: Tyrese Maxey, PHI (ADP: 19.9) Alperen Sengun, HOU (ADP: 19.6) Evan Mobley, CLE (ADP: 20.1) LaMelo Ball (ADP: 29.7)"}

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone.

Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

Here are the various pathways for LeBron and the Lakers for the 2025-26 campaign.", "body": "Brian Windhorst analyzes LeBron James' \"The Second Decision\" ad, and Shams Charania gives an update on James' glute injury. (1:48) The only signs of LeBron James inside the locker room an hour before the Los Angeles Lakers ' preseason opener tipped off in Palm Desert, California, last week were his gold No. 23 uniform hanging in his cubby and a triangular foam cushion placed on the seat beneath it. The jersey would not be needed on this night. The cushion would. Of the 42 players listed on the Lakers' and Phoenix Suns' training camp rosters, 22 were born in the 2000s and 19 were born in the 1990s. And one, James, was born in 1984 -- five months before Suns head coach Jordan Ott. The 40-year-old James didn't play in the exhibition game after being limited to light shooting through the first three days of training camp because of nerve irritation in his glute, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. The cushion, though, worked a full night, as his seat in the locker room and during the game at the end of the bench. When James eventually emerged in the locker room, wearing a T-shirt with the \"Forever King\" tagline from his latest Nike ad campaign printed on the front, he was asked by a reporter if he was ready to begin an unprecedented 23rd season. Before James could answer, Lakers guard Austin Reaves chimed in. \"You got another five seasons in you,\" he said. James' eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face. \"Why not six or seven, get to 30?\" the reporter continued. \"Yeah, set a record!\" Reaves added. James turned toward Reaves and smirked: \"I already set a record.\" Indeed, there have been approximately 5,000 players to suit up in the NBA, and James is the only one to stick around for 23 seasons. He has also scored more regular-season points than anyone else in league history (42,184), scored more postseason points (8,289), made more All-Star games (21) and was a part of the first active father-son duo to share the court as players together when he and Bronny James checked in against the Minnesota Timberwolves on opening night last fall.

Wright Wemby, Luka, Ant? Examining the players primed to become the face of the NBA Zach Kram 2 Related The accomplishments -- including the four MVPs, four championships and four Finals MVPs -- are well-documented. But if L.A. represents the fourth quarter of James' career after the first three were spent in Cleveland, Miami and Cleveland once more, the question now is whether the clock is truly running out -- or if he will push this thing to overtime. As James embarks on his eighth season with the Lakers -- the longest consecutive stint he's had with any of the franchises he's played for -- he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time after he exercised his $52.6 million option for the 2025-26 season in June without negotiating for an extension. During the Lakers' annual media day last week, the first question James fielded was about retirement. \"I don't know,\" said James, who earned second-team All-NBA honors in his 22nd season. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to play the game that I love for another season. And however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested. Because, like you said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later.\" The Lakers, who will be without James for the next three to four weeks as he deals with sciatica in his right side, are coming off a season in which they traded for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic and secured the No. 3 seed in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. But they fell to the No. 6-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. After James opted into his contract to stay in L.A., his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, issued a statement to ESPN's Shams Charania that many interpreted as an indication that James could finish his career somewhere else. \"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. ... We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.\" And after having full control over his career for his first 22 years, what's best and what's realistic could prove to be at odds. Here are the four possible ways this unprecedented season could go for James and the Lakers. LeBron James is excited about his Lakers squad this season and isn't sweating being in a contract year. James' time with the Lakers has seen him battle a rash of injuries that caused him to miss 124 games in seven seasons after he had missed only 71 in his first 15 years in the league. The Lakers' brass has cycled through four head coaches and the front office has had a mixed record on its trades and signings. Still, there has been plenty of success. The Lakers won a championship in 2020, with James becoming the first player in history to take home Finals MVP for three different teams. The franchise celebrated James in grand fashion when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer in 2023. And in 2024, the Lakers used the No. 55 pick to draft Bronny, allowing James to achieve what he had stated as his last remaining priority when he told ESPN, \"I need to be on the floor with my boy.\" A few months before the 2024 draft, the Golden State Warriors inquired about trading for James. The Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested. After the trade talks had passed, James expressed his commitment to the franchise. \"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and [have] been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said. Lakers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka, speaking at his annual season-opening news conference a few days before media day, made it clear where the franchise stands. \"We would love if LeBron's story would be, he retired a Laker,\" Pelinka said. \"That would be a positive story.\" While several sources close to James have told ESPN that it is unknown how the end of his career will play out, it could help James' desire to play on the best Lakers' team possible this season if it appears he has more basketball in him.

The Lakers can trade either their 2031 or 2032 first-round pick this season and have the right to swap firsts in five seasons in any deals they pursue this season, but they could be reticent to use those assets to invest in a team built for Doncic and James, if James is on the way out. For those looking for clues, there are a few out there. The Nike \"Forever King\" ad features a narrator speaking about James' career in the past tense -- \"They called him the Chosen One ... We were all witnesses.\" The Cleveland Cavaliers' \"Classic Edition\" uniform for this season is the same style James wore when he came into the league as a rookie with the Cavs in 2003-04. The NBA schedule makers had L.A.'s first home game of the season and last road game of the season both be against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, a fitting way for the two most important players of their era to have a proper send-off, if James is indeed on his last lap. And after media day, on his Instagram account, James posted a compilation of moments from the day with Lenny Kravitz's \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" playing underneath, possibly hinting at the end. Pelinka's answer at the news conference about James retiring with the Lakers was telling because he answered a different question than he was asked. He was asked if the Lakers would be interested in re-signing James in the summer of 2026. L.A. is projected to have approximately $50 million in cap space, which would all be swallowed up by James if he was to seek a new max contract. James will be eligible to sign up to a three-year deal for $188 million, with a starting salary of $58.1 million for 2026-27, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks. As great as James has been, extending his prime well beyond any reasonable actuarial table, there is a natural question as to how his timeline syncs up with the team's two other best players, both of whom are in their mid 20s. Doncic and Reaves, for their part, love playing with James and want the partnership to continue, sources told ESPN. Both players have not inquired with James about when he plans to retire, sources said, wanting to show respect for James' process. Doncic, who idolized James growing up, has enjoyed their partnership and believes James is vital to L.A.'s ability to win now, sources said. He is also undaunted by any spectacle or circus that could come with pairing up with James as he closes out his career because Doncic already experienced an aging legend on his farewell tour when Dirk Nowitzki's last season with the Dallas Mavericks coincided with Doncic's rookie year. Doncic found the time with Nowitzki to be invaluable, sources said. Plus, if the Lakers happen to win the championship this season -- bringing James' career total to five -- would he see that as a perfect ending, or would he want to come back to try to defend it and tie Michael Jordan with six? Tim Bontemps remains unsure on whether LeBron James will continue to play for the Lakers beyond next season. Paul's statement to ESPN in June established James' final priority as the curtain falls on his career: to win. That means, if L.A. is struggling -- whether because of injuries, poor roster fits, or simply because the team isn't good enough to thrive in the crowded West -- James could opt to leave. Since James holds a no-trade clause in his contract, any deal would need a greenlight from James to be executed. The problem is, there are not many viable destinations for him. Play Fantasy Basketball this season • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Cleveland, which would represent a second and perhaps final homecoming, would need to send out nearly $90 million in salaries to make a trade work, according to Marks, and the deal would have to involve multiple teams because the Cavs are not allowed to be over the second apron in a James trade. Because of their apron limitations, the Cavs would also be prevented from signing James off the waiver wire if he reached a buyout with L.A. The Warriors and New York Knicks would also be ineligible to sign James in that scenario. Then there's the Mavericks. James has won titles with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving , and has close relationships with coach Jason Kidd and several members of Kidd's staff. But the Mavs, too, would need to send out an exorbitant amount of money to make a deal work, according to Marks. Dallas is also currently a second-apron team, and would need to trade $12 million in salary without taking any back in order to become a buyout destination for James. There are 10 teams projected to have significant cap space in the summer of 2026, including the Brooklyn Nets , LA Clippers and Chicago Bulls , and there could be options for James that are currently unforeseen. However, it would be a major life change to leave Southern California when Savannah (his wife) and Zhuri (his daughter) live there, Bronny is under contract with the Lakers, and Bryce (his son) is a short flight away at the University of Arizona. And James will be in a free agent pool that potentially includes other stars such as Kevin Durant , Trae Young and James Harden -- plus impact players such as Reaves, Draymond Green , Bradley Beal , Norman Powell and Coby White -- so it's not a given he would receive endless interest around the league. And so James' situation remains undecided, and it's yet to be determined whether his 23rd season will be a countdown toward the end of his career or merely the bridge to a 24th, or beyond. Or whether his body will make the decision for him. \"Everyone is trying to dictate when he's done and the reality is nobody actually knows,\" a source close to James told ESPN. James, for his part, says he isn't concerned with the future for now. \"Not worried about yesterday and not trying to focus on what the future holds,\" he told ESPN. \"It's about staying present. ... Because like I said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it is not as long [away as] 'The Godfather 2.' So I know I got to stay present.\""}

Spokespersons representing the teams issued the same statement to ESPN: \"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved. The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks filed the lawsuit in August 2023, seeking more than $10 million in damages . The team alleged that the Raptors poached Ikechukwu Azotam, who worked for New York from 2020 to 2023, and ordered him to provide a trove of internal information after Toronto began recruiting him in the summer of 2023. The Knicks argued that this effort was geared toward giving the Raptors a competitive advantage. The Knicks specifically alleged that Azotam -- who worked for the Knicks as an assistant video coordinator, then as a director of video/analytics/player development assistant -- sent the Raptors thousands of confidential files, including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The Knicks also alleged that Azotam did so at the request of the Raptors, whom they said were trying to \"organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff,\" the August 2023 complaint stated. The Raptors, Azotam, Toronto head coach Darko Rajaković, player development coach Noah Lewis and 10 \"unknown\" employees were listed as defendants in the lawsuit. In an October 2023 court filing, the Raptors called the Knicks' allegations \"baseless\" and a \"public relations stunt.\" The Raptors also argued that the \"alleged 'theft of data' involved little more than publicly available information compiled through public sources readily accessible to all NBA Members.\" The Raptors repeatedly called for NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in and settle the dispute, and a judge in the U.S. Southern District Court in Lower Manhattan agreed . The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, meaning it is dismissed permanently."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might've made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4 of 5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. Harper played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot, or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he'd feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense, too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So, I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter after running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically, but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So, [it's] just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates from a cluster of nerve roots in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, the Lakers are 56-78 (.418)."}

Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

McConnell sustained his injury during Tuesday night's preseason game against the Minnesota Timberwolves . The Pacers made a move to address their depth at point guard Thursday, signing veteran Cameron Payne to a training camp contract. The Pacers waived guard Delon Wright in a corresponding move. Wright also left the Pacers' preseason opener early due to a head injury. McConnell, 33, averaged 9.1 points and 4.4 assists last season in 79 games. He averaged 9.5 points and 4 assists in 23 playoff games to help the Pacers reach the NBA Finals. The Pacers were already short-handed at point guard with All-Star Tyrese Haliburton sidelined for the season because of a torn Achilles he suffered in the Pacers' Game 7 Finals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Andrew Nembhard will start at point guard this season in Haliburton's absence. The Pacers open the regular season on Oct. 23 against the Thunder in a rematch of the Finals."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds.

Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League. He is set to back up DeMar DeRozan , so presumably he wouldn't get enough minutes early on, but he's another free agent I'll have my eye on once the season begins.

The New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors agreed to voluntarily dismiss a lawsuit alleging the Raptors stole thousands of confidential files from the Knicks, according to a court filing obtained by ESPN . The teams dismissed the suit with prejudice, permanently ending the legal dispute. The case was initially set to be settled this summer , nearly two years after the Knicks filed the suit in August 2023 . \"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved,\" team spokespersons said to ESPN. \"The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks alleged in the 2023 lawsuit that the Raptors recruited Ikechukwu Azotam -- who worked as the Knicks' assistant video coordinator -- and ordered him to send them confidential material including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The team sought $10 million in damages . The Knicks alleged that the Raptors, who had recently hired coach Darko Rajaković, \"conspired to use Azotam's position as a current Knicks insider to funnel proprietary information to the Raptors to help them organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff.\" The Raptors in October 2023 filed a motion to dismiss, argued that the claims were \"baseless\" and said the information was publicly available to all NBA members. They asked NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in, and a U.S. District Court judge ruled last year , to the Knicks' chagrin, that Silver should resolve the dispute. He was set to oversee the settlement in an arbitration meeting in July. It is a rare occurrence for NBA teams to sue one another. The only other known case came in 1977 when the Knicks were involved in a dispute with the Nets . They claimed that the Nets' attempted move from Long Island to New Jersey infringed on their territorial rights, and the Nets sued and claimed the Knicks were violating antitrust laws. The NBA and state of New Jersey settled the dispute, and the Nets paid the Knicks $4 million for the right to move. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Strahinja Jokić, the older brother of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokić, pleaded guilty Friday to charges stemming from a fight that occurred during an NBA playoff game in April 2024. He pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing and one count of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to one year of probation. The incident drew widespread attention after a short video of the altercation circulated on social media following the Nuggets' Game 2 win against the Los Angeles Lakers last postseason. The clip, which was later cited in a police statement of probable cause, appeared to show a verbal exchange between the Jokić brothers and a fan before one of the brothers struck the man in the face. One of Nikola Jokic’s older brothers punched a fan after last night’s Nuggets and Lakers game. 😳 (via cgallegos67/TT) pic.twitter.com/JdpNLxxjg0 Investigators identified Strahinja Jokić as the person who threw the punch. According to police documents , he told officers he \"felt he'd done nothing wrong because he was 'defending an older man that he has known for a long time.'\" The older Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault but ultimately pleaded guilty to lesser offenses as part of a resolution to the case. The incident did not involve his younger brother, Nikola, who was on the court at the time of the playoff game. Jokić's older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, are regular fixtures courtside at Nuggets games and have been protective presences throughout Nikola's career. It's not the first time Strahinja has faced legal trouble in Denver. In 2019, he was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman during an altercation inside an apartment. He was charged with second-degree assault , false imprisonment and obstruction of phone service, later pleading guilty in 2020 to felony trespassing and a misdemeanor count of obstruction. The remaining charges were dismissed. The Jokić brothers have also been involved in several public incidents tied to Nikola's on-court altercations. In 2021, they traded social media messages with NBA players Marcus Morris and Markieff Morris after a scuffle between Nikola and Markieff during a game against the Miami Heat . That same year, video surfaced of Strahinja and Nemanja shouting at Phoenix Suns players from the stands following a hard foul involving Nikola during the playoffs. While Nikola Jokić has largely stayed clear of controversy, his brothers' passionate support has at times drawn attention away from the three-time MVP's dominance on the court. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Officers were responding to an unrelated multi-vehicle crash that temporarily closed several lanes of the northbound freeway. As traffic lanes reopened, officers noticed a Range Rover stopped in the road south of the crash site. When approached, Pierce was asleep in the driver's seat, and officers observed signs of alcohol impairment, according to a CHP news release. Pierce was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor driving under the influence and booked at the CHP's Central Los Angeles Area office.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . It's one thing to lose in the NLDS after entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. It's quite another to be eliminated in the most heartbreaking fashion imaginable , which is what happened to the Phillies in Game 4. After Philadelphia fought into the 11th inning of a pitcher's duel, the Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the frame. Andy Pages hit a little nubber back to the mound, and instead of trying for the out a first base, Orion Kerkering threw the ball away at home plate. Asked for his thoughts on the play after the game, Kerkering faced the harsh reality : \"This really f---ing sucks right now.\" Once the sting of this one starts to wear off, the Phillies will have to look ahead to an offseason full of unknowns . In particular, free agency could bring big changes to the Philly clubhouse. As R.J. Anderson writes, a few key players are set to hit the market, and the Phillies must decide whether they're willing to pony up in order to retain them. Misery loves company, and the Phillies weren't alone in the City of Brotherly Love . The Eagles lost to the Giants , and the Flyers dropped their season-opener. That's just the second time all three teams have lost on the same day. At least the 76ers didn't lose. Allow me to play the role of Captain Obvious and point out the LeBron James ' injury is a big blow for the Lakers as they begin the 2025-26 season. For more insightful reaction and analysis, we turn to CBS Sports NBA expert Sam Quinn. Could this James injury open the door to more playing time for Bronny James ? Who will start in place of the four-time MVP? These are some of the questions Quinn wrestles with in his piece on the ripple effects of James' absence , but the most intriguing question is whether this boosts Luka Dončić 's bid for the MVP. Even before this injury to James, there was some question about whether the Lakers added enough around Dončić to be true NBA title contenders. That question is only more pertinent now. Just as everyone predicted, the Giants faced the Eagles as 7.5-point underdogs and came away with a 34-17 win . As has been the case for the last few weeks, Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo led the way for New York on the field and in the vibes department. Right from the jump, Dart and Skattebo were locked in as they tormented Vic Fangio 's defense. Dart finished the night with 253 total yards and two touchdowns. Skattebo piled up 110 total yards and three scores. Those numbers are great, but they don't even tell the full story. In last week's loss to the Saints , Dart committed three turnovers, and the Giants committed five as a team. Those tanked their chance to win on the road (duh), but New York committed zero turnovers on Thursday. Dart's ability to avoid those negative and disastrous plays only enhance what's in the box score. The duo of Dart and Skattebo has a bright future, but they're already doing big things in the present. Jordan Dajani explains the multiple ways in which that big blue tandem made some history last night.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year odds, picks: Best bets, from favorites to long shots", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-sixth-man-of-the-year-odds-picks-best-bets-from-favorites-to-long-shots/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T14:55:07+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "The Sixth Man of the Year race will be wide open in the 2025-26 season", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

See which current stars and emerging names will lead the next generation of fantasy hoops.", "body": "Figuring out where to rank players is difficult enough in any particular season. But how about doing it with an eye towards what the NBA may look like in five years? That’s the point of this exercise, with Rotoworld basketball writers Raphielle Johnson and Noah Rubin combining to put together their top-25 fantasy list for 2030. While the list is primarily populated with players currently in the NBA, there are a few who have yet to play an official NBA game. Some players, whether in the NBA now or yet to reach that point, will break through by 2030. Here’s our top 25, and it should not be surprising who leads the way. Age (as of October 10): 21 After taking the NBA by storm as a rookie, Wembanyama’s impact was muted last season due to a blood clot that sidelined him from the All-Star break onward. The 7-foot-3 phenom has been given a clean bill of health and is poised to usher in a new era in the NBA. Before his season-ending injury in February, Wembanyama averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.1 steals, 3.8 blocks and 3.1 three-pointers per game with 47.6/35.2/83.6 shooting splits. Age: 18 Flagg has yet to play in an official NBA game, but the incoming rookie is deserving of being high on any list that’s looking ahead to five years from now. He won’t turn 19 until just before Christmas, making it possible (likely, even) that the Mavericks forward still will not have reached his prime by 2030. He’s got all the skills a franchise could want in a cornerstone, which is a void the Mavericks need to fill after trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers. Cooper Flagg was EVERYWHERE during his preseason debut 🔥🔥🔥 10p/6r/3a/1b in 14 minutes pic.twitter.com/p8CGp8A6mF Age: 27 Gilgeous-Alexander, who won NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Finals MVP honors while leading the Thunder to their first title last season, is still not 30 years old. Yet it feels like he’s been around for far longer than that, with the Canadian point guard being the 11th overall pick in the 2018 draft. Who knows how many titles and individual accolades he’ll have on his résumé by the time 2030 rolls around, but SGA should remain one of the best assets in fantasy basketball. Age: 24 Cunningham’s production has increased in each of his four NBA seasons, with the 2024-25 campaign being the one in which his growth coincided with that of the franchise he leads. Appearing a career-best 70 games, Cunningham averaged 26.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 9.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.1 three-pointers. The Pistons point guard recorded career-high averages in points, assists, blocks and three-pointers with a 46.9/35.6/84.6 shooting split. If Cunningham can keep the turnovers in check, as he averaged 4.4 per game last season, he’ll be an even better player to have rostered in fantasy leagues. Age: 26 Like many who follow basketball, Dončić was stunned when the Mavericks traded him to the Lakers in late January. He appeared in a career-low 50 games in 2024-25, appearing in 60 or more in each of his first six seasons. While LeBron James remains active currently, the Lakers have already made it clear that the franchise has begun the “Dončić Era,” and this summer, he signed an extension that runs through the 2028-29 campaign. As long as Luka is healthy, he’ll be one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 Mobley’s fourth NBA season was his best, with the Cavaliers forward/center averaging 18.5 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 0.9 steals, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 three-pointers per game. His role on the offensive end of the floor expanded in the first season of Kenny Atkinson’s tenure as head coach, and there’s still plenty of room for growth. The only question is what will Cleveland’s frontcourt look like in 2030. Will Mobley continue to share the court with another big man, as he currently does with Jarrett Allen ? Or will he shift to center full-time? Age: 24 Like Mobley, Edwards’ position could change by the time the year 2030 rolls around. Current Timberwolves starting point guard Mike Conley turns 38 on October 11, meaning there could come a point in the near future where Edwards is either sharing the backcourt with Rob Dillingham or being utilized as an uber-athletic scoring point guard. Whatever is decided, Ant-Man has the skill needed to be a cornerstone for his franchise and fantasy rosters. Age: 23 Şengün, who led Türkiye to a silver medal at EuroBasket this past summer, turned 23 in late July. While his scoring average decreased by two points compared to his 2023-24 number, the Rockets center earned his first All-Star Game appearance last season and averaged a double-double for the first time in four NBA seasons. Şengün’s all-around skill set makes him a center who should be highly valuable in fantasy leagues five years from now, especially if he were to develop a more reliable perimeter shot. Age: 22 After taking on a supplementary role as a rookie, the versatile Thompson figured more prominently in the Rockets’ rotation last season. And with Fred VanVleet sidelined by a torn ACL, the 2025-26 season could be a preview of what’s to come for Thompson. Compared to his rookie season, the 6-foot-7 wing’s averages improved in all major categories while shooting nearly 56 percent from the field. Like Şengün, Thompson is in a position where things could get truly scary if he’s able to develop a consistent perimeter shot over the next five years. Age: 23 The biggest concern for Holmgren is the injuries. After sitting out the entire 2022-23 season with a foot injury, he was limited to 32 games last season by a broken hip. Sandwiched in between those two seasons was a 2023-24 campaign in which Holmgren did not miss a game. When on the floor, he’s a gifted frontcourt player who can be used at power forward or center, and that versatility will serve Holmgren well over the next five years. Age: 23 Like Holmgren, availability has been an issue for Johnson during the early stages of his NBA career. He’s appeared in more than 60 games just once and is coming off a 2024-25 campaign in which he was limited to 36 appearances. However, Johnson did finish last season with career-high averages in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots while shooting 50 percent from the field. As long as he stays relatively healthy, the tools are there for Johnson to be a highly impactful fantasy player in 2030. Age: 18 Peterson is the first of three players on this list who have yet to play a college game, much less enter the NBA. But the Kansas freshman is that good. A combo guard who can play on or off the ball, the 6-foot-5 Peterson is on the short list of many regarding the top draft-eligible prospects for 2026. Winner of the 2025 Naismith Trophy Boys School Player of the Year award, Peterson was also a McDonald’s All-American this past season. High praise from Coach B 🙌 Our 2011-12 @Werner_Safety Naismith Men’s College COY shares how impressed he is with incoming Freshman Darryn Peterson. 👀 pic.twitter.com/YZrxWsxzZM Age: 24 Maxey, who will turn 25 in early November, has averaged 25.9 and 26.3 points per game over the last two seasons. While there are significant questions regarding teammate Joel Embiid’s injury history, the 2024-25 campaign was the first in which Maxey failed to play at least 60 games. In five years’ time, he should be the cornerstone in Philadelphia and an elite player worthy of first-round consideration, regardless of league format. Age: 18 The 6-foot-9 Boozer, whose father Carlos enjoyed a 13-year NBA career, was a two-time winner of the Gatorade National Player of the Year award while in high school. The combination of build, athleticism and skill set makes the younger Boozer a player capable of playing anywhere in the frontcourt, and that versatility tends to make for an excellent fantasy option. Like Peterson and another player a little further down on this list, Boozer is projected to be among the top draft-eligible talents for 2026. Age: 25 While it remains to be seen how Haliburton’s recovery from a ruptured Achilles tendon will go, he’s already one of the best players in fantasy basketball when healthy. Last season, he averaged 18.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.7 blocks and 3.0 three-pointers per game while leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000. He’ll miss the entire 2025-26 campaign, but Haliburton should remain one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 After three seasons in which he played at least 70 games, Wagner suffered an oblique injury that limited him to 60 appearances last season. However, he was excellent when on the floor, providing fourth-round value in eight- and nine-cat formats. A healthy Wagner can be an even greater asset, regardless of league format, because of his efficiency and versatile game. Like a few of the players above him on this list, Wagner needs to improve his perimeter shot, as he’s shot 28.1 and 29.5 percent from three over the past two seasons. Age: 24 The reigning champion Thunder have three players on this list, and none are over 27 years old. Williams can be plugged in just about anywhere within a lineup; that’s how versatile his game is. Due to injuries, he even spent some time at the center position last season. Williams’ averages have increased in each of his three NBA seasons, and he earned third-team All-NBA and second-team All-Defense honors in 2024-25. He won’t be 30 years old until the latter stages of the 2030-31 regular season and still has not begun his athletic prime. Age: 27 Like Haliburton, Tatum is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during last season’s playoffs. However, the Celtics star’s recovery will be interesting to watch, as he has not been officially ruled out for the 2025-26 season. Will Tatum attempt to return? And how would that impact the next five years of his NBA career? Tatum already has eight NBA seasons under his belt, but he has the skill set that can make him a serious factor in fantasy basketball when 2030 rolls around. Age: 18 The third and final current collegian on this list, Dybantsa will also be in contention to go first overall in next summer’s draft if he declares. The 6-foot-10 forward will be the biggest story in the state of Utah this season, especially with the Jazz in the midst of a rebuild. Dybantsa was the top-ranked prospect in the Class of 2025 and is a three-time FIBA gold medalist. Dybantsa’s explosive athleticism and varied skill set make him a player who can have a significant impact in fantasy basketball by the time 2030 rolls around. AJ Dybantsa made his BYU debut tonight at Marriott Madness 🔥 @MarchMadnessMBB pic.twitter.com/yGdZqWHRBz Age: 19 The second overall pick in the 2025 draft, the 6-foot-6 Harper can be used anywhere on the perimeter. During his lone season at Rutgers, he spent most of his time on the ball but can also take on an off-ball role. On a Spurs roster that includes Wembanyama, De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle , that may be something Harper has to do early on, but he’s capable of progressing into a lead playmaker role over the next five seasons. Age: 22 The 6-foot-10 Banchero has recorded increased points and rebounds averages in each of his three NBA seasons, but turnovers have limited his impact in fantasy basketball, especially in category leagues. However, that should not be the case in 2030, when Banchero may be beginning his athletic prime. Five years from now, this spot on the list may prove to be egregiously low for Banchero. Age: 24 Despite his age, Ball has already played five NBA seasons. However, while production has not been an issue for the Hornets’ point guard, staying on the court has. The 2021-22 season is the only one in which Ball has played at least 60 games; he’s appeared in 47 or fewer in each of the last three. The injury concerns have knocked Ball down many fantasy draft boards; hopefully, that won’t be an issue five years from now. Age: 30 Jokić is the only player on this list aged 30 years or older. However, the skill set and elite production cannot be ignored, especially for a player whose game is not reliant on “jump out of the gym” athleticism. The Joker has been the top-ranked player in fantasy basketball in per-game value in four of the last five seasons, and no lower than second in totals in six straight. Will Jokić still be in the NBA in five years’ time? We’ll see, but the track record of excellence is why he has to be on this list. Age: 24 After earning his first All-Star Game appearance in 2023-24, Barnes recorded similar numbers last season. And he’s capable of doing more, provided he becomes a more consistent shooter. Barnes shot 27.1 percent from three last season and is a career 30 percent shooter from deep on 3.6 attempts per game. He doesn’t have to turn into the next Stephen Curry , but consistent shooting would improve Barnes’ fantasy profile, given what he can already do as a playmaker and defender. Age: 27 Young has played 73 games or more in three of the last four seasons, and most recently, he led the NBA in assists. Having averaged a points/assists double-double each of the last three seasons, the Hawks’ point guard can remain a fantasy force for years to come. Something to watch is how young players like Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels progress, as their development may benefit Young in the turnover category. He’s averaged at least four per game each of the last six seasons, lowering Young’s value in nine-cat formats. A Division of NBCUniversal .

We'll see if a deal gets done before the season or during the upcoming year.\" Westbrook's decorated resume speals for itself, with an NBA MVP and two scoring titles to his name. While the 37-year-old guard is a ways removed from his prime, Westbrook appears to still have plenty left in the tank after serving as a vital cog in the Denver Nuggets' rotation during the 2024-25 NBA season. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game in 75 appearances for Denver in his last campaign, shooting 44.9 percent from the floor and 32.3 percent from deep. The Kings signed Schröder to a three-year contract that likely slots him into Sacramento's starting point guard role, but the addition of Westbrook could prove to be a vital step in insulating the team's backcourt for the marathon that is the NBA season. Sacramento opens the regular season on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 22. Whether or not Westbrook will be in a Kings jersey by then remains to be seen, but it certainly is something to keep an eye on going forward. Download and follow The Deuce & Mo Podcast"}

They also stayed winless in the preseason, falling to a 128-98 loss to the Magic in their first exhibition game at Xfinity Mobile Arena. VJ Edgecombe sat because of left hip soreness. He took part in the Sixers’ morning shootaround and is considered day-to-day, according to a team official. Other absences included Joel Embiid (left knee), Paul George (left knee), Trendon Watford (right hamstring) and Jared McCain (right thumb). Quentin Grimes was inactive two days after his first practice of the season. The Sixers will hold their annual Blue-White scrimmage Sunday and finish their four-game preseason next Friday vs. the Timberwolves. Here are observations on the team's loss to Orlando: Tyrese Maxey and Dominick Barlow were early standouts. The Sixers’ first basket came on a Maxey transition three-pointer. To no one’s surprise, Maxey came out aggressively. He fired up nine shots in under seven minutes and played with tons of speed and confidence. Maxey poured in 17 first-quarter points and watched the rest of the game. three ball courtesy of @TyreseMaxey 👌 pic.twitter.com/2f5ggfpiuc Barlow scored the Sixers’ next bucket on a put-back layup. He did strong work on the offensive boards in his third straight start and had 12 points and nine rebounds over 29 minutes. Barlow has a 7-foot-3 wingspan and good athletic tools, and he’s rebounded the way those on-paper traits would suggest. Notably, the Sixers plan to be a guard-heavy team and know they must improve their rebounding. Barlow’s boosted his case for minutes with his preseason showing on the glass. Well done for a 22-year-old on a two-way contract. Not for the first time, Adem Bona had a rough start on the foul front. He committed two personals in under two minutes, including on a Wendell Carter Jr. and-one jumper. Of course, the other side of Bona’s ball-hungry defensive style is that he’s often rewarded with rejections. His bounce and rim-protecting instincts popped as usual. Bona swatted Desmond Bane, Paolo Banchero and Anthony Black layup attempts in the first half. Bona with the denial! 🚫 pic.twitter.com/XYS4Kd1LQN Andre Drummond continued to play behind Bona. The highlights of Drummond's night were a pair of corner three-pointers. Drummond made three long-range jumpers and missed 17 last season. He’s 18 for 140 (12.9 percent) in his career. Hunter Sallis received first-quarter minutes and got an and-one runner to drop against fellow rookie guard Jace Richardson. The Wake Forest product tallied seven points and three assists in 34 minutes. The Sixers used a five-man bench in the first half of Sallis, Drummond, Kennedy Chandler, Jabari Walker and Johni Broome. Emoni Bates and Malcolm Hill checked in after halftime. Broome (six points, three steals) played at both power forward and center. He had some tough moments defensively against players like Banchero and Carter. Banchero tried to drive baseline past Broome and throw down a powerful slam. Broome stopped him with a clear-cut foul. The 23-year-old lefty's physicality and shot blocking were strengths in college. It’s an open question how he’ll adapt to NBA-level size, quickness and leaping. Chandler was the Sixers' lead ball handler for much of the game and had a 16-point, five assist, four-steal night. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse has given him significant minutes in all three of the team's preseason contests. “ He’s played very well,” Nurse said following the Sixers' practice Thursday. “ He’s got pretty good feel for running and organizing the team. He’s also got some juice to get by people and get to the basket. And he’s also a very good shooter. “ He didn’t shoot as much from three in those games as he’s been doing in practice. He’s a legit threat from three. ... I’ve been impressed with his knowledge of the game, the way he’s picked things up and the way he’s transferred that to keeping the team fairly organized.”"}

Even for Antetokounmpo.", "body": "Talks in August between the Knicks and Bucks about a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade never gained real traction. That shouldn’t be a real surprise. If the Bucks are forced to trade one of the five best players walking the face of the earth — and they would only do so if Antetokounmpo demands it — they will want back a massive haul of first-round draft picks and promising young players, two things the Knicks do not have. One other thing that shouldn’t be a surprise out of those talks: Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson was “untouchable in these talks,” something Sam Amick reported at The Athletic . Not only is Brunson an All-NBA player on a favorable contract, but he is also a fan favorite and hero in New York. Trading him would anger the fan base, even if it was for Antetokounmpo. One of the financially cleanest trade options between the Knicks and Bucks is Brunson and Josh Hart for Antetokounmpo, those salaries come within about $300,000 of each other and work under the salary cap restrictions. It’s also a non-starter for both sides — the Knicks aren’t giving up Brunson, while the Bucks want picks and young players to jump-start a rebuild, not veterans. Any eventual Knicks offer likely involves Karl-Anthony Towns and a player such as OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges (who can’t be traded until Feb. 1 and has a massive new contract kicking in). A mid-season trade of Antetokounmpo and his $54.1 million salary — to the Knicks or any team — is highly unlikely. Things get interesting if Antetokounmpo says he does not intend to sign the four-year, $260 million extension the Bucks can offer next offseason. If that happens, there would be a massive line of teams that would want in on an Antetokounmpo deal and many of them — Houston, San Antonio, Chicago and others — have the young players and picks Milwaukee would be seeking in a deal. Likely the only way Antetokounmpo ends up in New York is if he forces his way there, telling teams he will only sign an extension with the Knicks, and if these other teams trade for him, he will be a rental. Even then, like Toronto did with Kawhi Leonard in 2018, those teams still may be willing to take the gamble. For now, everyone wants to see how this season plays out. The Knicks rightfully see themselves as a team that can come out of the East. The Bucks want to see what Antetokounmpo and Myles Turner look like together. Houston with Kevin Durant, San Antonio with its young backcourt, and just about every other team wants to see how things look before making a massive move like trading for Antetokounmpo. Which is why it’s likely there is no action until next offseason. That’s not going to stop the chatter and rumors. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Strahinja Jokić, 43, pleaded guilty to trespassing and disorderly conduct after punching a Lakers fan in the face courtside at the Nuggets' Ball Arena. The trespassing charge is a misdemeanor, whereas the disorderly conduct charge is a petty offense. Strahinja Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault after video of the punch made the rounds on social media. The Lakers fan, identified as Nicholas Meyer, claimed in a lawsuit that he suffered a concussion as well as cuts and bruises on his face, plus a deviated septum, per The Denver Post. \"The assault shattered my sense of safety and control,\" Meyer said in court Friday, via 9News . \"I became fearful of leaving my home, especially with my family. I worry constantly about retaliation, not just from the Jokić family, but from fans who might recognize me and act out violently.\" Strahinja Jokić was charged in July 2024.

In 2019, Strahinja Jokić was charged with assault and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing phone service and a felony count of trespassing as part of a deferred sentence, per The Denver Post, which reported that he was accused of choking and pushing a woman and then precluding her from calling 911. Strahinja Jokić's trespassing charge was dismissed in 2022 after he successfully followed court rules for unsupervised probation and didn't commit another crime during the two-year term, according to The Denver Post, which cited court records.

Recovery from sciatica tends to take more than a couple of weeks.", "body": "While the Lakers just announced this week that LeBron James is suffering from sciatica and will be out for the first couple of weeks of the season — at least — it turns out he has been dealing with this for months. LeBron first started experiencing sciatica nerve pain in late July or early August during on-court workouts, reports Shams Charania of ESPN on NBA Today . Here is what he said: “My understanding is this injury for LeBron, this nerve issue, first developed, first occurred, in late July, early August, during an on-court workout. So it’s now two-and-a-half months and counting that he’s had to deal with it and manage it. So even before the Lakers’ Media Day on Sept. 29 and the start of training camp, I’m told LeBron James had not done much basketball for well over a month prior to that. So it had been a normal routine summer for him. He’s a creature of habit, we know that by the way he maintains his body. So for him to be out to start the season and miss his first-ever Opening Night, it shows an admission by him and the Lakers that he needs more time to ramp up, getting into basketball shape, getting into the right basketball conditioning that he’s accustomed to. He’s not there yet.” Because of the pain on his right side — the sciatic nerve runs from the tailbone down the leg to the feet — LeBron has been limited in his workouts, both physically and on the court. Once he’s pain free, it’s going to take time for him to get his conditioning up to speed and shake some of the rust off his game. All that can take longer at age 40. LeBron will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, but could well be out longer. For the Lakers, that puts more on Luka Doncic’s plate to start the season. It will also start to give GM Rob Pelinka and the Lakers front office a view of what Austin Reaves looks like as the No. 2 option next to Doncic. Reaves can be (and is expected to be) a free agent next summer, and the Lakers have to decide if he’s worth it to them to pay him $25-30 million a season and keep him around, or if they should look elsewhere. How this injury heals — and what’s causing the compression of the sciatic nerve, whether it’s muscular, a herniated disc, or something else — could also impact LeBron’s decision about how much longer he wants to play. LeBron is entering a record 23rd NBA season and will be a free agent next summer, giving him a lot of options for what the final year or years of his playing career could look like.

Steph Curry has been a Warrior for life. Drafted by Golden State in 2009, he has become the face of the franchise, a multi-time MVP and champion. He has worn No. 30 for all 16 seasons of his Warriors career, a number that’s become part of his identity as much as his shooting form. So when his younger brother joined Golden State , one question lingered: what number would Seth Curry take? He wasn’t able to secure No. 30 from Steph. “I tried to buy it from him,” Seth joked. “He said he didn’t need the money.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. \"I tried to buy it from him, he said he didn't need the money.\" Seth wasn't able to secure No. 30 from Steph 😂 pic.twitter.com/oGeSAVgVkr Seth actually has worn No. 30 for most of his own career, including recent stints with the Brooklyn Nets, Dallas Mavericks and Charlotte Hornets. Before that, he spent two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers wearing No. 31, and earlier in his career bounced between 30, 31 and 10 as he moved from team to team. This NBA season is the first time since Seth entered the league as an undrafted rookie in 2013 that the two have shared a training camp, finally taking the floor as teammates instead of competitors. The 35-year-old joined the Warriors on an Exhibit 9 contract, which allows him to participate in training camp and the preseason. Because of the NBA’s second-apron restrictions, Golden State will need to waive him before finalizing its roster — but the team can re-sign him as early as Nov. 11 while staying under the tax threshold. The lighthearted jersey swap at open practice gave Warriors fans a glimpse of the brothers’ easy chemistry — and a reminder of how rare it is to see both Currys on the same court. Steph remains the Warriors’ cornerstone, while Seth begins a new chapter in familiar territory, wearing a familiar number — just not No. 30. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James , who is suffering from a case of sciatica. The current timetable is set for James to be reevaluated in 3-4 weeks. Needless to say, this is a huge loss for the Lakers, who run the risk of being without the future Hall of Famer for almost a month, which could significantly impact where the organization ends up this season. It's no surprise that James offers production in multiple areas. He's a top-tier playmaker and strong rebounder, and despite being 40 he can still be penciled in for 24-25 points per game. But the stats only tell you so much. There's also the element of him being a 6-foo-9, highly versatile and extremely physical floor presence, which are now features the Lakers will have to play without. James' ability to get to the foul line, as well as the threat of him in transition, will force the Lakers to slow things down, and likely by a considerable margin. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] That's a lot of easy scoring opportunities suddenly taken off the floor, not to mention a big, wide body, who is agile enough to defensively rotate between the perimeter and the interior. This isn't to say the Lakers are out of the playoff picture before the season even starts. But it does make any race later in the year difficult if they find themselves behind the curve when the calendar flips to 2026. With James out, the burden falls even more on the franchise's best player, Luka Dončić. The Slovenian lost weight over the course of summer, and has been getting early MVP buzz based on his play at EuroBasket, where he looked more engaged defensively and had better stamina. Dončić is known as someone who can put up big numbers, and as a player the offense can run through. This hasn't changed, and the Lakers are likely banking on the All-Star to carry an increased level of responsibility with James out. If the Lakers somehow get out to a strong start and find themselves within the top 6 in the time they're without James, that is going to be an enormous argument for the MVP chances of Dončić, who has yet to win one in his career. Of course, he'll have to get some help for the Lakers to find themselves in that position. That's where Austin Reaves, who will unquestionably get more on-ball opportunities without James, has a chance to shine. The 6-5 off-guard has always been reliable, but the Lakers are going to need him to approach legitimate All-Star production with James out. Can he do that, even though his play tends to overlap with that of Dončić? Or will head coach JJ Redick stagger them to a point where both Dončić and Reaves deliver when the other is on the bench? There's a lot to figure out in La La Land, but the Lakers have on-court options to help their chances with James out, and keep their head above water. Of course, it does need reminding that when James does return, it shouldn't come as a surprise if the Lakers dip a little in production. Installing a high-volume scorer, who is also a heavy on-ball creator, doesn't happen overnight, which is something the players and coaching staff will have to ready themselves for."}

[ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Amen Thompson – G/F, Houston Rockets: Amen flashed elite rebounding and defensive instincts last season, averaging roughly 1.15 fantasy points per minute. Playing alongside Kevin Durant should open up lanes for drives and assist opportunities. The lack of 3s and forgettable FT percentage are the only two knocks on an otherwise elite fantasy profile. No Fred VanVleet means Amen and Reed Sheppard will be running the show. Tyrese Maxey – G, Philadelphia 76ers: The undisputed No. 1 option in Philadelphia, Maxey’s efficiency and scoring volume make him a safe bet in all formats. His usage spike ensures multiple 40-plus-point fantasy nights, even with the health concerns surrounding the Sixers' roster. Jalen Green – G, Phoenix Suns: Green’s move to Phoenix gives him the green light to score at will. With Devin Booker drawing defensive gravity, he's always available and has a clean slate to fire away — the exact kind of highly explosive player you'll want for High Score. Kyshawn George - G/F, Washington Wizards: One of the more intriguing deep sleepers, George’s size and floor spacing give him multi-position upside. If he cracks the starting lineup, his length and shooting could push him into must-roster territory. Shaedon Sharpe – G, Portland Trail Blazers: With Anfernee Simons gone, Sharpe steps into a larger offensive role after averaging 27.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 10 games without him last year. Although he averaged under 1.0 FPPM in 2024-25 (0.93), he looks primed to anchor Portland's scoring alongside Deni Avdija. With high usage and expanding playmaking, Sharpe's a breakout bet who will eclipse the 30+ fantasy-point mark per game in High Score and points leagues. Isaiah Collier – G, Utah Jazz: Now Utah's starting point guard, Collier has averaged 6.3 assists and 0.9 steals per game through his first 71 games, solidifying his role as the team's primary facilitator. He's my prime late-round selection for High Score and he could finish top-10 in assists this season. Jaden Ivey – G, Detroit Pistons: Ivey's return from injury has reignited his breakout path. He averaged 17/4/4 last year and he'll be the secondary scoring and facilitating option alongside Cade Cunningham. His blend of pace, scoring and playmaking makes him a High Score steal outside the top 100. With increased usage and a 30-point floor when hot, Ivey's poised to deliver the breakout season Detroit's been waiting for. Paolo Banchero - F, Orlando Magic: The Magic finally have spacing, and that means more playmaking for Banchero. I'm in the minority, but I think we'll see the best version of Paolo yet. With Desmond Bane in town, expect upticks in assists and field-goal efficiency with fewer turnovers. I still prefer him in points over 9-cat leagues, but I'd still get him in 9-cat. Trey Murphy III, F, New Orleans Pelicans: Murphy is one of the league’s best breakout bets for 2025–26. When healthy last season, he averaged 0.98 fantasy points per minute. His combination of athleticism, 3-point volume, and efficiency gives him a real shot at making an All-Star-like leap — both in real life and fantasy. Deni Avdija – F, Portland Trail Blazers: Avdija’s game has always hinted at versatility, and in Portland, he’ll finally be unleashed. After the All-Star break last year, Avdija averaged 23-10-5. Handling the ball more and attacking mismatches, he’s a glue guy with the stat diversity to post strong all-around lines. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Bennedict Mathurin – G/F, Indiana Pacers: Mathurin’s aggressiveness is finally being matched with opportunity. He can get hot quickly, and as long as he locks in on defense, he'll be one of those boom players who's ideal for High Score. He'll also be solid for 9-cat leagues. Zion Williamson – F, New Orleans Pelicans: Zion enters 2025-26 in the best shape of his career, motivated by a contract fitness clause and New Orleans' push to compete before their 2026 pick goes to Atlanta. He averaged 1.56 FPPM in 30 games last year and remains one of the league's most efficient interior scorers, producing elite per-minute output. Since turnovers don't count and ceiling games are the north star in High Score, Zion's a top-15 lock whenever he's active. Brandon Miller – F, Charlotte Hornets: Before his wrist injury, Miller averaged 21.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists while commanding a larger offensive load. His 1.01 FPPM pace shows growth as a shot-creator and secondary playmaker next to LaMelo Ball. He profiles as a multi-category wing with top-60 upside across all formats, especially High Score. Tari Eason – F, Houston Rockets: Eason ranked in the 91st percentile in fantasy points per minute among frontcourt players. His energy translates directly into rebounds, steals and buckets. If his minutes climb, he’s one of the most efficient stat-stuffers available after Round 10. Jalen Duren – C, Detroit Pistons: Duren’s double-double consistency anchors Detroit’s frontcourt. He's in a contract year and has shown growth as a short-roll playmaker. He averaged an impressive 1.23 fantasy points per minute last season, and as his rim protection improves, that number should only climb in his fourth season. Santi Aldama – C, Memphis Grizzlies: Aldama remains under the radar but continues to produce whenever given minutes. His shooting and rebounding profile make him a sneaky floor-spacer who can hit double-digit points and boards in under 25 minutes. Aldama will play heavy minutes to start the year and is still being picked outside of the top 100 on Yahoo. Isaiah Hartenstein – C, Oklahoma City Thunder: Always a per-minute beast (~1.10 fantasy points per minute), Hartenstein is being undervalued in the market across formats. He does everything but shoot 3s and make free throws at a high clip. However, I love him as a sixth- or seventh-round pick if I don't nab bigs earlier in the draft. Kel’el Ware – C, Miami Heat: Nikola Jović's hype is building, but I'm still targeting more shares of Ware. He averaged over 1.0 fantasy points per minute last season and has so much potential as a rim runner. His ADP is falling because he came off the bench in the Heat's past two preseason games; I would buy the dip. Dereck Lively II – C, Dallas Mavericks: Daniel Gafford is already hurt and Lively's ADP is at a very affordable price at 116th overall. With 30 minutes a night potentially on the horizon, Dallas' primary defensive anchor is trending up after a season where he posted 1.19 FPPM. Although his usage is low, he's a cheap double-double big man with boom potential on the defensive end."}

The gym on this day belonged to Jimmy Butler III . “He just had an incredible practice,” coach Steve Kerr said. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “He wasn't on my team, so I didn't like to see it,” Stephen Curry said partly in jest. “But it was indicative of the ceiling that we can get to with a guy like that. A guy who at any moment knows how to win.” Even Butler’s faux nemesis, Buddy Hield , offered nothing but props to the man who turned 36 last month. “Jimmy dominated practice today,” Hield said. “It was great for him. He looked really good and professional today. It was great. Great energy.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Though general praise tends to flow freely in every training camp, the reaction in this instance is highly encouraging for the Warriors. There are many stories of Butler dominating scrimmages in his previous stops, whether Chicago or Minnesota or Philadelphia or Miami. Butler’s infamous scrimmage with the Timberwolves in 2018 is one that made its way around the NBA. Three weeks after asking to be traded, he led a group of reserves to victory over a squad that included four starters, with center Karl-Anthony Towns often the target of his ferocity. Butler was loud, hyperaggressive and, well, a winner. That last trait is welcome in Golden State. Though there was no indication hostility, seeing him bring juice to a scrimmage warms the heart of the team’s established veterans like Curry and Green. For doing so with the Warriors, who belong to Curry more than anyone, suggests Butler still is capable of being The Man. That while he embraces being “Robin” to Curry’s “Batman,” – the roles can be interchangeable upon request. “I just think he took it up a notch today,” Hield said. “He wasn’t chirping like that Jimmy we know of. He was a silent killer, and his work speaks himself.” There were shades of that Jimmy last season, as Butler occasionally took over portions of a game, usually when Curry was off the floor. He managed to make a significant impact despite being the new guy, tossed onto the roster during the searing heat of a playoff chase. “Last year, Jimmy didn’t know any defensive terminology,” Draymond Green said last week. “We were just making it work.” Butler this season is with the Warriors for a full training camp, which followed team workouts he arranged in the days before camp officially began. He’ll miss the third preseason game, Sunday against the Lakers in Los Angeles, for what Kerr called a “wonderful” personal matter, but he is scheduled to practice Saturday in LA before departing. This was, in a way, a reminder. Butler putting together a “Himmy Lives” display can only be beneficial for young Warriors to witness and veterans to realize his back pocket contains plenty of what they hope to see once the regular season begins on Oct. 21. “He was very impactful, across the board, getting to his spots, (flashing) his competitive will,” Curry said. “Our practices have been at pretty high level. Not every day, scrimmaging, but he kind of built up to a good session today. From the jump, Jimmy was attacking the rim, dictating the pace on both ends.” This is the Butler the Warriors need to threaten teams beyond Curry, and every occasion he shows up will be greeted with delight.

As we inch closer to the start of the NBA regular season, we’re getting an early look at players and teams. And while we should take what we see in preseason with a grain of salt, there’s some excitement building. Now would usually be the time to tell you who is on the verge of breaking out in 2025-26, but I find that limiting. When I watch the preseason I'm intrigued by what impact players — from rising stars to established veterans — can have on their teams if something I'm seeing can carry over to the regular season. That’s the joy of the preseason, seeing the payoff from offseason development and preseason experimentation. Here are a few names to keep an eye on at the start of the season. The intrigue with Wembanyama comes from wondering what approach he will take in Year 3. There is a balance that comes with offensive versatility. On one hand, a team can use a player in a lot of different scenarios — on ball, in the post, as a roller, off screens. That type of sandbox approach can keep consistent pressure on defenses, as there is not one specific thing to take away. On the other hand, a team can lose the emphasis on a specific action on a night-to-night basis. One thing has appeared clear from watching Wembanyama in preseason: a change in shot selection. For all of his size and skill, Wembanyama averaged nearly nine 3-point attempts a night last season. Through two preseason games so far, he has taken exactly two 3-pointers. There’s a clear emphasis for Wembanyama to increase his paint touches and work to catch the ball closer to the basket. More attempts to drive the basketball, and more attempts to initiate contact, should result in a better balance offensively. Working to seal matchups near the post or elbow is a way to keep pressure on defenses. His strength will be tested as teams continue to be physical with him on drives or fight to push his catches out. Can he get to his spots consistently? What does that look like when he does? Keep an eye on his playmaking this season. The Spurs have worked to use multiple players as screeners which could open up pops for shooters or rolls when they go double big. Wembanyama appears to be making more contact as a screener while mixing in slips and quick rolls — knowing when to roll and force the weakside to help, and knowing when to pop to force a rotation. A quick swing or a drive against a closeout could keep an advantage for the Spurs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] On the defensive end, Wembanyama is always a sight to behold. In pick-and-roll, he can be near the level of a screen, drop back to contain the drive, use his wingspan to swipe down at the ball-handler and still recover to his man popping or rolling. If the offense takes that space as a chance to pull up, that can easily turn into a switch and contest. His size jumps off the page when he is defending on the weakside, sometimes seeming like he can remove a quadrant off the court with his presence. The rim protection speaks for itself (176 blocks in 46 games last season, most in the league), but I'm intrigued by how he'll adjust as teams work to space him and play off his rotations. Murphy made a large leap last year prior to a shoulder injury, but I believe there is even more room for his game to expand. Never doubt the combination of knowing what you can do and working to improve on everything else. The quick decisions and reads continue to grow. When he’s spaced on the perimeter or running in transition, the threat is no longer just a 3-point shot but a drive. You can feel that impact when he’s used off the ball in dribble handoffs or pindowns. If you are not physical and give him space, or try to go under, the shot is going up. If you lock and trail, he can turn the corner and get to the paint or to his pull-up. If you try to get physical, you open up backdoor cuts or curls to the basket. The Pelicans will need that type of versatility in the half court which pairs well with Zion Williamson’s ability to be used in different ways. Murphy has also been looking to initiate contact to get to where he wants to vs. only taking the space given. An improved handle could open up more opportunities in pick-and-roll where he can reject and try to get downhill. Pitch-and-catch action could open even more room for him. It will be interesting to watch what it looks like if he has the mindset to create space in different areas of the floor. It's not difficult to think of the ways Horford’s experience can help a Warriors team that features Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green. But the speed in which you can see it already has surprised me to a degree. The defense is what jumps off the page. Horford's scheme versatility defending pick-and-roll will add a level of consistency to the Warriors' defense. His ability to get to the level of a screen, turn it into a trap, drop and contain penetration is key. We have seen time and time again no matter the age, Horford is willing to switch and defend multiple positions, and late switches can help the Warriors recover. The Warriors having Horford’s help defense on drives or rotations on the baseline is one thing. Having that with Draymond and Jimmy on the court feels like another. Offensively, Horford’s ability to space and willingness to move the ball fits right into the Warriors' ethos. The passing can open up cutters and keep an advantage for the Warriors when they get a defense in rotation. He can be involved in screening actions on and off the ball. How often have the Warriors had a big who can set a post split and receive a post split? Mike Brown has brought more ball movement, player movement and freedom to the New York Knicks offense. McBride looks like he fits right in to the vision and is set up to thrive within the offense. Simply put, it is wise to believe in a scoring guard within the confines of a Mike Brown offense (see Monk, Malik). More pace and more tempo should open up more opportunities for McBride to attack offensively. More opportunities in transition to attack an early clock suits McBride a little more than bringing the ball up (slowly) and going right into a set. An emphasis on spacing should also highlight McBride’s ability to get downhill to score. The ball moving from side to side should allow McBride to attack a tilted defense. Combine the offensive confidence with the effort he gives defensively and that unlocks even more lineup versatility for the Knicks. Do not be surprised by three-guard looks with McBride guarding a top option. The potential has always been there for Sharpe, but all of the elements appear to be coming together for a breakout season. One of the tougher things for a young, athletic player to navigate is understanding how and when to change speeds. Early in the preseason you can feel the growth from Sharpe in that area. There is more poise and composure, a combination of patience and confidence. We’re seeing a scorer play with an understanding of when and how to get to his spots against the space defenses are giving him. Sharpe is doing a better job of setting up his defender to get screened in pick-and-roll and, instead of hitting the turbo button to get downhill, he’s taking the space and attacking appropriately. The midrange pullup is there, but that attack can open up a kick, or a quick burst of speed can turn it into a drive. The more he can get downhill against closeouts, the tougher he becomes to guard. That kind of shiftiness can only open up things for him — and Portland — offensively. The sky is the limit if he is able to consistently mix the drives and self-creation. This is less about Cam Johnson the talent and more what Cam Johnson the talent unlocks for the Nuggets. It's the little things that can help them offensively. Running the wing in transition as Jamal Murray flows into pick-and-roll with Nikola Jokić. Seeing that action take place and diving from the wing to the block to take his man out of help defense. Forcing someone else to rotate which opens a kick from Jokić for 3. Running pick-and-roll with Jokić, kicking to the wing and immediately relocating for a 3. Backdoor cuts with a willing passer that put pressure on the defense. Those types of things have already stood out. The Rockets have added Kevin Durant to their roster, Alperen Şengün has gotten even better, Amen Thompson will get more responsibility in the Rockets' offense. I remain intrigued by what this season can look like for Smith. There is a clearer runway for him to have an impact on both ends of the floor, both with the starting lineup and mixing in with bench units. In the preseason we’ve seen a good mindset from Smith. Defensively, he has played with a high level of activity, switching and defending multiple positions. Defense is the base for the Rockets' success and the more he can grow on that end the better. Offensively, he’s continued to play with aggression, but it feels like it has more purpose behind it. If he gets a switch, he's trying to dive in the paint to get deep position. He's hitting first on his drives instead of solely relying on getting to a fadeaway. He's throwing the ball into the post and setting a post split to get involved in off-ball movement. It feels like his growth could be flying under the radar, but if he continues to hit the right notes that’s only good news for the Rockets. With both Tyrese Haliburton and T.J. McConnell out to start the season, it could be a moment for Nembhard to emerge. The Pacers will be different, but a lot of their principles will remain the same. Now is the time to see if Nembhard can build on the base he’s showcased the past few seasons. With Indiana's pace, tempo and movement, I do not think Nembhard will have to be the true “engine” of the Pacers offense. But there will be a lot more opportunities for him to impact the game offensively, and I want to see what that looks like. How much can he help the Pacers keep being the Pacers when it comes to pace/tempo? How does he handle being a larger part of a team’s game plan? Will the extra opportunities unlock a different level of aggression? We have seen the playoff production, the shotmaking, the defense, but this is a player who has yet to average more than 30 minutes a game in the regular season. The fit felt good when Cleveland traded for Hunter at the trade deadline; the team needed a wing who could defend multiple positions, knock down shots and drive the basketball. With a full offseason of familiarity in tow and some early injuries, is there room for Hunter to continue to grow? The shotmaking always feels important for Hunter’s overall impact, but this is a Cleveland offense that is built on pace and tempo. That can open a level of freedom which could allow Hunter to have more of an impact offensively. Does Cleveland work to get him the ball in different areas of the floor? Is there more room for him to drive or be involved in pick-and-roll? It feels like there is a real opportunity for Hunter to have an impact for the Cavs this year. Honestly, I am very excited to watch another year of Thompson being a mad man on defense. If you enjoy screen navigation, point-of-attack containment and overall activity, he will bring it to you every single night. But the athleticism and drives — and what that means for Detroit — is where the fun can begin on offense. Cade Cunningham runs the show, but Detroit values having shooting and playmaking on the floor. Can Thompson get consistent paint touches to force defenses to help and create advantages? Defenses may want to go under, but if he can turn the corner and become a pressure point, a lot opens up for Detroit. This one feels less like box-score growth and more like an opportunity for a player to really develop. New coach, new system and new opportunities abound in Memphis, and it’s clear they value what Wells brings to the table. There has been more of an effort to get him involved on and off the ball, and he’s shown an ability to space the floor. If he can continue to improve offensively, while being active on ball and pesky off ball defensively, Memphis could have a gem."}

It’s also a terrible predictive tool — don’t place your bets based on their responses ( might I recommend the clever folks at the NBC Sports betting page for your tips ). A year ago, 25 of the 30 GMs picked Boston to repeat (that was probably 26, Brad Stevens can’t vote for his own team), yet Oklahoma City won 68 games and the title — the GMs have picked the champion just once in the last seven years (the 2024 Celtics). So, is it a worrying sign for Oklahoma City that 24 of the 30 GMS picked them to repeat as champions? No, it’s more a sign of the conventional wisdom thinking around the league, which this survey certainly provides. Some highlights from the voting: NBA Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (80% of the vote). Cleveland and Denver were tied for second (7% each). East Champion: Cleveland Cavaliers (63% of voters had them first, 27% second), with the New York Knicks second (30% first-place votes, 53% second). West Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (87% of voters had them first). Denver was second (10% had them first). Who will win MVP? Nikola Jokic, 67% of the vote. The next three in line were Luka Doncic (10%), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (8%), and Victor Wembanyama (7%). Who will win Rookie of the Year? Cooper Flagg, who got all but one vote (and Nico Harrison can’t vote for his own guy, so there was one vote for VJ Edgecombe). Flagg was also overwhelmingly voted the rookie that will be the best in this class five years from now (just know five years ago the GMs voted James Wiseman that honor). What player would you pick to start a franchise? Victor Wembanyama (83% of the vote, which makes you wonder what the other 17% are thinking). Player most likely to have a breakout season: Amen Thompson in Houston (30% of the vote). Brandon Miller (Charlotte), Ausar Thompson (Detroit) and Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio) were tied for second. Which team made the best overall moves this offseason? The Atlanta Hawks (53% of the vote). The second choice went to the Houston Rockets (27%). Which one player acquisition will make the biggest impact? Kevin Durant to Houston (73% of the vote). Desmond Bane to Orlando was second, and also voted the most underrated move of the offseason. Most surprising move of the offseason: Milwaukee waiving/stretching Damian Lillard (second on this list was the Bucks signing Myles Turner, which only happened because of the waive/stretch of Lillard). Who was the biggest steal in terms of where they were drafted? In a bit of a surprise, it went to Kasparas Jakucionis to Miami, selected at No. 20. Tied for second was Ace Bailey to Utah at No. 5 and Carter Bryant to San Antonio at No. 14. Best defender in the NBA: Victor Wembanyama with 80% of the vote. Dyson Daniels was voted the best perimeter defender in the league. Who is the best head coach in the NBA? Newly minted USA Basketball head coach Erik Spoelstra of Miami, with 52% of the vote (OKC’s Mark Daigneault was second, and the Clippers’ Tyronn Lue was third). Which team’s level of success this season is toughest to predict? The Philadelphia 76ers got 47% of the vote (Dallas and Golden State were second and third). With all due respect to the questions around the Mavs and Warriors, how do you not pick the Sixers? Which player is the most athletic? Amen Thompson got 58% of the vote to finish first (Anthony Edwards in Minnesota was second). Here’s one I questioned a little: The GMs voted Stephen Curry the best leader in the NBA. That surprised me. Not that Curry isn’t a strong leader, but would you put him ahead of Jalen Brunson, LeBron James, or even the injured Damian Lillard? One other interesting question and answer: What rule most needs to change? The No. 1 answer was concerns about roster construction, specifically that the tax apron rules are too harsh, and that there should be a salary cap discount for a team’s own drafted players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 48-34 (7th in the West, lost to the Timberwolves in the second round of the playoffs) Offensive rating : 114.2 (16th) Defensive rating : 111.0 (7th) Additions: Al Horford, De’Anthony Melton, Seth Curry, Will Richard, Alex Toohey Subtractions: Kevon Looney, Braxton Key, Kevin Knox Complete roster The home-run swing for Butler completely transformed the Warriors to a degree that few midseason acquisitions ever do. He gave Steve Kerr’s club another avenue of attack, bringing low-turnover, high-efficiency isolation play and a steady diet of free throws to the party to serve as a perfect complement to Golden State’s tried-and-true Stephen Curry-centered motion offense. He diversified and strengthened the team's defense, pairing with Draymond Green to give the Dubs two high-IQ multipositional possession-wreckers capable of putting out fires all over the half-court. The impact was immediate, obvious and overwhelming: A .500 team with a negative point differential entering the trade deadline , Golden State posted the NBA’s fourth-best record , third-best net rating and No. 1 defense afterward. In the 43 regular- and postseason games following Butler’s arrival, the Warriors went 28-15 — a 53-win pace. In the 35 games in which Butler, Curry and Green all appeared, they went 27-8 — a 63 -win pace. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] They outlasted a young, hungry, physical and damn good Rockets team in Round 1, winning a Game 7 on the road despite Butler playing through a pelvic contusion and Curry dealing with a thumb injury , and took Game 1 of the conference semis on the road in Minnesota. It would prove a pyrrhic victory; as soon as Steph pulled up with a hamstring injury , Golden State’s fate was sealed. Even in defeat, though, its future path was clearly illuminated. The Curry-Green-Butler trio worked like gangbusters, and with the contracts of all three lined up for two more seasons (provided Green picks up his $27.7 million player option for 2026-27 ), the Warriors would try to maximize their potential of contending for a title right friggin’ now. “My headline is, this team heading into the season has got a great shot,” Dunleavy Jr. said on media day. So: In comes Al Horford , on the cusp of his 40th birthday, but still a supremely additive performer and hand-in-glove two-way fit with championship experience who, as Kerr put it, “fits any lineup, makes any lineup better.” (Big Al has already passed the first test facing any new arrival in the Bay: understanding that “the whole mindset is trying to make the game easier for [Steph].” Good start!) In comes Seth Curry , who shot 45.6% from 3-point range last season; who ranked in the 86th percentile in points per possession finished as a spot-up shooter and in the 96th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball-handler , according to Synergy; and who seems like a pretty good bet to slide smoothly into a system that his brother’s been running for, oh, 50 years. Back comes De'Anthony Melton , a two-way chaos agent who was a rotation piece during Golden State’s hot start last season before suffering a sprained left ACL and eventually being dealt to Brooklyn . Back comes Gary Payton II , a perpetually peculiar player who somehow manages to fit perfectly in Golden State, screening and diving and making the extra pass and guarding everyone with tenacity and alacrity. [ Get more Warriors news: Golden State team feed ] This, then, is the operating principle: Get as many smart players as possible — guys who understand how to cut, move, guard and pass, who understand how to play off of and maximize the three superstars — and see how it all shakes out. If, after a frostbite summer of sore feelings , the finally re-signed Jonathan Kuminga is willing to play a circumscribed role that fits into that framework , then that’s great news. And if he’s not … well, Jan. 15 will be here before you know it , and a two-year, $46.8 million deal could bring back pieces that more snugly fit the Warriors’ M.O. If everyone’s rowing in the same direction, and if the long-in-the-tooth centerpieces to whom Kerr, Dunleavy Jr. and the rest of Golden State’s braintrust have hitched their wagons can stay upright and operational, then we’ll have a chance to find out if what we saw after the trade deadline was just a small-sample-size magic trick, or if it’s sturdy enough to sustain over a longer haul. If it’s the former, then maybe we’ve already seen Steph’s last best chance at a winner. If it’s the latter, though, then we might be looking at a bona fide title contender. All the stuff I just said goes right! None of Steph, Draymond, Jimmy or Al miss extended periods, resulting in the Warriors finishing in the top 10 on both ends of the floor. GPII and Melton combine for something like a full season of havoc-wreaking, the supplemental youth — Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody, Gui Santos, young bigs Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post — gets in where it fits in around the aging tentpoles, and Dunleavy finds a Kuminga deal that bolsters the core. The Warriors finish with home-court advantage in Round 1 and, with a healthy Steph, a puncher’s chance against anybody they draw in the West. A roster carefully constructed around four of the NBA’s oldest players crumbles when those guys do what old guys do: get hurt and miss time. Golden State looks brilliant for stretches, but only for stretches, and none of that supplemental youth proves capable of shouldering a heavier load. No Kuminga deal materializes, and the bad taste of this summer lingers over an underwhelming season spent scuffling for a play-in berth and that ends before April’s out … and with Steph staring down his age-38 season, the end of the line looks to be approaching faster than anybody wants it to. Season opener : Oct. 21 at Los Angeles Lakers Complete schedule Start penciling in a couple of weeks of missed time here and there for their critical graybeards, and it’s not hard to see a world where they dip down below the mid-40s. If what we get is the version of the Warriors that ended last season plus Horford, though? Then Golden State should blow this number away.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 40-42 (eliminated in play-in tournament) Offensive rating : 113.7 (17th) Defensive rating : 114.8 (18th) Additions : Kristaps Porziņģis, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luke Kennard, Asa Newell Subtractions : Clint Capela, Larry Nance Jr., Georges Niang, Terance Mann Complete roster Trae Young is a four-time All-Star. He has averaged as many as 29.6 points and 11.6 assists per game. He has led his team as far as an Eastern Conference finals. And he is 27 years old — squarely in his prime. If ever there were a season for Young to take a step forward in his career — to move past the criticisms of his contributions as a winning player, especially on the defensive end — it would be this one. And if ever there were a team built to accentuate his game and mask his deficiencies, it would be this one. The Hawks added one-time All-Star center Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (among last year's Sixth Man of the Year candidates) to a roster that already boasted a talented rim protector and a cache of versatile wings. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Porziņģis will join Onyeka Okongwu in the frontcourt. Who will start is anyone's guess, but given Porziņģis' performance at EuroBasket over the summer, the guess here is that he will get the nod. Either way, Atlanta can field 48 minutes of quality rim protection behind Young, while Porziņģis also adds a layer of versatility on the offensive end. Young has never had a pick-and-pop option quite like Porziņģis. Nor has Young had this many versatile two-way wings to assist him on defense. In addition to Alexander-Walker, Atlanta features rising star Jalen Johnson, Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels and 2024 No. 1 overall draft pick Zaccharie Risacher. Luke Kennard and Asa Newell also joined the fray this season. The Hawks are deep and talented and built to support a ball-dominant superstar on his quest for a championship. The big question, then: Can Young be the best player on a serious title contender? We have our doubts, recognizing that doubts are what drive Young. He should also be driven by criticisms of his value as a teammate — levied by former NBA player Patrick Beverley over the summer. Young does have a tendency to make a game about himself, but he has also never had this much help. Do not forget about the matter of Young's contract, either. He owns a $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. He is eligible for a four-year, $229 million extension, which has not yet been offered. Is there a figure that satisfies both parties? It feels weird to go into a season in which the team has title aspirations (however long its shot might be) while the roster's best player is on a lame-duck contract. [ Get more Hawks news: Atlanta team feed ] Do the Hawks believe in Young as a driver of winning? That they must answer this season. And early. Because other teams will be asking themselves the same question, as they consider trading for Young. There are no good options if Young cannot lead this team into contention. What do the Hawks do, then? They can trade him, though they would have to find a team willing to give up real assets and pay Young. They could let him walk for nothing, freeing up cap space, though they have had no luck in big-name free agency. Or they could sign him to a fair extension, perpetuating a team with a sub-championship ceiling. It is so much better if Young is just awesome and embraces the brand of basketball that can coalesce a roster. Everything flows from there, because the Hawks would have their man, their team and real hope. Young is everything the Hawks imagined him to be, getting off the ball a little more on offense and digging deep on defense, and his effort on both ends sets a tone: The Hawks are here to compete. Johnson is an absolute star, maybe even an All-Star. They get a healthy season from Porziņģis. Risacher takes a step forward. Daniels is a menace. Everyone else is rock solid, and Atlanta has a real shot at winning the East. That's right. They could win this Eastern Conference. Whether or not they can beat whoever emerges from the West is another matter, but who cares, for Atlanta hasn't seen a Finals ... ever. Young is nothing the Hawks imagined him to be, prioritizing his own success over the team's. His business as usual on both ends stagnates the development of the young wings at his side — Johnson, Daniels and Risacher — and no amount of rim protection can guard against Young's carelessness on defense. Bad vibes permeate the locker room, and a trade is necessary, only Atlanta cannot find much more than nickels on the dollar. The Hawks take another step back in order to move forward behind a young core, which is not the worst of options, except that they'll need another point guard. And who is that guy? This is the catch-22: The Hawks may be damned to never win if they do keep Young and damned if they don't. Season opener : Oct. 22 vs. Toronto Complete schedule Trae Young is good. His supporting cast could be great. And what's the fun of rooting against a could-be contender? Take the over and hope Young is great, too. And he better be, because the team is built for it. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

In a sit-down with NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke for \"Dubs Talk,\" the Golden State guard reflected on why the 2024-25 NBA season was the happiest of his basketball life and how coach Steve Kerr’s leadership played a central role. In his exit interview last season, Hield summed up his first Warriors campaign by saying, “This is the most happy I’ve ever been playing basketball.” With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Asked why Golden State has been different, Hield pointed to the trust and freedom he was given. “They allow me to be myself,\" Hield told Burke. \"They allow me to be me. Previous teams I’ve been on, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy, but here it’s just a unique vibe than the rest of the teams. They allow me to express myself, and I was able to to play basketball with a lot of joy and not have to look over my shoulder.” Before arriving in the Bay Area, Hield played for the New Orleans Pelicans, the Sacramento Kings, the Indiana Pacers and the Philadelphia 76ers, carving out a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable 3-point shooters. In his first season with Golden State, Hield averaged 11.1 points and 1.6 assists per game, providing a steady scoring presence off the bench and spacing the floor alongside Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler.

Beyond the numbers, Hield described how the environment around him made the biggest difference. \"Everything was authentic from the coaches and the players, and it’s one situation where I just feel at peace,\" Hield added. That peace, Hield explained, stemmed from Kerr's leadership style . \"A lot of people say that coaches are transparent,\" Hield noted. \"A lot of coaches are not transparent. I think Steve was just 100 percent honest, transparent from day one, and never once has Steve given me the wrong answer. He’s always been straight up with me, and that’s what I like.\" The 60-year-old coach has built his Warriors tenure on communication and trust, winning four NBA championships while managing a locker room full of stars. Kerr, a former guard who played 15 NBA seasons and won five championships with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs, took over Golden State in 2014. Since then, he’s guided the Warriors through one of the league’s most successful runs. For Hield, that straight-shooting approach stood out immediately. \"As a basketball player, you love to be happy like that and love to play with that joy, and I couldn’t ask for a better year than that.\" With Kerr’s honesty and the Warriors’ support behind him, Hield enters Year 2 in Golden State not just chasing wins, but carrying the peace of mind that changed his game.

It is beyond cool that 40-year-old LeBron James , one of the greatest players in history, is on the same roster as Luka Dončić , one of the most decorated young players the NBA has ever seen. It is impossible not to think of their Lakers as a great team, if only because in our minds the two of them are that good. Whether they make practical sense as a championship duo is another matter. James is currently suffering from sciatica on his right side , which will cost him the start of the season. This is not news that inspires much confidence in James' ability to hold up his end of that bargain between two max-salaried co-stars. Meanwhile, Dončić is a 26-year-old who appears to be in the best shape of his life . One makes sense to build around. The other? He will be, at some point soon — if not now — just hoping the bottom doesn't fall out on his career. As difficult as it may be, the Lakers have to consider whether it is wise to spend any more of Dončić's prime investing in the chance that James could still be who Dončić needs him to be. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Already, James is no longer the defensive stalwart he once was, not even close, and Dončić has never been known for his defense. Offensively, there is also a ton of overlap among their skill sets as ball-dominant superstars. There is reason for skepticism — reason to ask: Can they still maximize each other? They are, of course, also two of the greatest offensive minds the game has ever seen, and they will figure a lot of things out. They will win a lot of games, so long as James can get healthy, but can they win a title? The defense is a hindrance to that goal. Their third-best player, Austin Reaves, is no stopper. Nor is Deandre Ayton. The Lakers did sign one-time Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart, but at age 31 he has not displayed the same on-ball dynamism he once did. This is going to be a porous defensive team. They ranked 17th on that end last season and lost Dorian Finney-Smith, their best defensive player. Remember: Dončić and James took the floor together in the first round of last season's playoffs, losing in five games as favorites to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Los Angles did little to address its fatal flaw. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] The Dallas Mavericks built a team of two-way talents around Dončić and Kyrie Irving to reach the 2024 NBA Finals. The Lakers will eventually have do the same around Dončić in L.A., but they have not done that. Reaves and Ayton have a lot of potential between them, but little of it is on the defensive end. In Dončić's case, there is time to fix this. He is entering his prime and signed a three-year, $160.8 million contract extension. James does not have any of those luxuries. He will turn 41 years old in December, his contract expires at the end of this season, and we have no idea when Father Time will come for James. If, indeed, it becomes clear that this roster is not one with which Dončić can win a championship, what do the Lakers do? Do they try to reconfigure it around Dončić and James on the fly in the narrow window that they have together, dealing a 27-year-old Reaves and draft picks in search of two-way contributors? That has a real possibility of backfiring. Make moves in desperation, and the Lakers could easily find themselves in a post-LeBron era without any flexibility on the trade market, trying to field a competitive team around Dončić. Take a step back, and the plan becomes much clearer: Focus on Dončić — now. Build around him the way you would around a young James, and you know what a young James would do? Trade the 40-year-old aging superstar whose $52.6 million salary is a deterrent to building a title team around its best player. That, or let him walk in free agency at season's end, freeing up the kind of salary-cap space that could be committed to a more age-appropriate playing partner in Los Angeles. This is L.A., after all, and these are the Lakers. Someone will want to join Dončić on this ride. It is unclear if James even wants to be that guy, as his agent, Rich Paul, issued the following cryptic statement this past June: \"We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage of his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.\" What is best for James may not be what is best for Dončić, and the Lakers will soon have to choose sides. What that looks like in the short-term is anyone's guess, but one of their superstars is just beginning his L.A. story, while the other is scripting its end. Threading the needle between them may be a fool's errand."}

Kuminga added that what stood out most during negotiations was the way those leaders shared their perspective, teaching him about the contract process and giving him patience when he needed it most. \"I spoke to Buddy. I spoke to Draymond. I spoke to Jimmy. I spoke to Steph,\" Kuminga added. \"All of them. I had a 20-plus type of conversations of how contracts work, how to feel about certain things. They were teaching me certain things.\" That mentorship became especially important when Kuminga missed the Warriors’ players-only minicamp in San Diego.

The 23-year-old forward’s role has fluctuated throughout his career, especially after Golden State acquired star forward Jimmy Butler last season. That fluctuation has created some uncertainty for Kuminga and created a big contention point during the offseason’s contract negotiations. Kuminga, speaking to Andscape’s Marc J. Spears , said he is choosing not to worry about his role. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “I don’t ask [Warriors coach Steve Kerr] about roles because I know what he is going to tell me,” Kuminga said to Andscape. “I don’t waste my energy. I choose not to ask because nobody is going to tell me. It’s whatever. You just have to find ways to do things when you get out there. Make plays, defend. I don’t have a consistent role. I just play a role where I make sure I play defense and run the floor.” When the Warriors don’t have superstar guard Steph Curry available, Kuminga has been tasked with being more of a focal point in the offense. But most nights, as it has been for over a decade, Curry is the driver of the offense. But that doesn’t render Kuminga useless by any means. Kerr detailed what a key supportive role looks like for Kuminga in an exclusive interview with NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke on “Dubs Talk.” “I think the role is right there for him,\" Kerr told Burke. \"We need JK’s size, athleticism on the wing, his ability to guard the big wing guys like Luka [Dončić], LeBron [James] and Kawhi Leonard. So, the role is right there for him. I know it hasn't always been easy for him because he’s wanted more of a role, being more of a focal point in our offense.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Kuminga does recognize this, telling Spears that he thinks his role is “to rebound, play defense and run the floor,” while also saying that he doesn’t “stress myself about it or think about” variations in playing time from game to game. Nevertheless, Kuminga and his camp feel that he can reach All-Star level play with a starting role . Kerr, speaking to Andscape, acknowledged that wasn’t in the mix. “It’s been an interesting fit. He’s made it pretty clear that he wants the ball and an opportunity that a lot of his cohorts get and people that were drafted near him. And we weren’t able to offer that,” Kerr said to Andscape. “We were a championship team. We won the title his rookie year [2021-22] and have been in the mix the last few years. So, it’s been tough. I respect the fact that he is competing and fighting in a set of circumstances that maybe isn’t ideal for him. But the thing I keep telling him is he can play a role for us, absolutely, with his size, speed and athleticism. “He can play an important role on a very good team. He just turned 23 [on Monday]. He has plenty of basketball ahead. One day, hopefully, he will look back on this as a valuable time in his career. But I know he’s frustrated. He’s made it very clear publicly. I don’t mind that, but I want him to embrace the idea that he can be a part of something special.” In his four years of NBA service, Kuminga has averaged 12.5 points per game with a 50.7 field goal percentage in 22.0 minutes per game.

He has come close twice, reaching the NBA Finals with the Miami Heat, but the six-time All-Star still hasn’t won the ultimate prize. After joining Golden State at the 2025 NBA trade deadline in February, Butler now is in his first full year with the team — and he made clear that his top motivation isn’t silencing his own doubters, but securing another legacy-defining title for Steph Curry and Draymond Green. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “It would mean the world to me, but it would mean the world to me if they won,\" Butler told NBC Sports Bay Area's Kerith Burke on the latest \"Dubs Talk.\" Butler understands his teammates’ résumés speak for themselves. Curry, drafted by the Warriors in 2009, already is a four-time NBA champion, two-time MVP and widely considered the greatest shooter of all time. Green, selected by the Warriors in 2012, also has won four titles and built his reputation as the franchise’s defensive heartbeat , earning a NBA Defensive Player of the Year award in 2017 and nine All-Defensive Team honors along the way. Still, history shows that a fifth ring would move both into an even smaller circle of all-time greats. Only 26 players in NBA history ever have won five or more championships. For Butler, that pursuit isn’t about collecting another trophy, but about cementing his teammates’ place among the legends of the game. Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. \"They’ve already solidified themselves in the basketball fame and in the league, we get that,\" Butler explained. \"But to separate themselves from other individuals -- you get five, like, you’re there. You know? No doubting, you can’t question it.\" The Warriors’ dynasty already has stretched across three distinct eras — the “Strength in Numbers” group that broke through in 2015, the Kevin Durant years of 2017 and 2018 , and their 2022 return to glory behind the original core. Winning a fifth title would underline just how adaptable Curry and Green have been at the center of it all. \"You can’t say, ‘Who was on your team?' \" Butler added. \"You’ve done it with multiple different types of players and rosters. You get five, nobody is questioning anything about anybody that got five.” If the Warriors do reach that mountaintop again, Butler will know he played a role in ensuring Curry and Green’s dynasty ends with no questions left to ask.

From Matas Buzelis to Amen Thompson, find players poised to deliver high returns.", "body": "Manage your account ... When it comes to preparing for your fantasy basketball draft(s), it is incredibly important to identify players who could be headed for a breakout campaign. Those types of players offer plenty of upside with the potential to provide tremendous return on investment for managers. In this article, we'll highlight some of the guys you should consider drafting who have the talent and opportunity to take a leap during the 2025-26 season. Buzelis has been a popular choice as a potential breakout candidate for his hometown Chicago Bulls after a strong Summer League. The 20-year-old continued that momentum in his two preseason outings so far, posting averages of 15.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 0.5 steals and 1.0 blocks on 55.6/40.0/75.0 shooting splits in 18.6 minutes. He didn't start a game until after the All-Star break last year as a rookie, but Buzelis is expected to take over as a full-time starter in Year 2. Over his final 27 games in the first unit in 2024-25, Buzelis put up 13.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.6 steals and 1.1 blocks in just 26.8 minutes a night. He should certainly see an increase in playing time as a sophomore, and in an up-tempo offense with Josh Giddey at the helm, Buzelis' speed and athleticism will be on full display. With a year under his belt and growing self-confidence, he'll get every opportunity to improve upon his preseason success as a two-way difference-maker. It might be difficult to think of Mobley as a breakout candidate after he won the 2024-25 Defensive Player of the Year award, but the forward-center is ready to make another jump at both ends of the court as he enters his fifth season as a pro. Through his first four years with the Cavs, he's never averaged more than 12.8 field goal attempts a night. In 2025-26, coach Kenny Atkinson, Mobley and Donovan Mitchell have talked extensively about the 24-year-old demanding the ball on offense while making a concerted effort to run more offense through the big man. In limited preseason action, Mobley has been on-ball a bit more, recording a 27.9% usage rate in 44 total minutes across two outings. The sample size is small, but with Cleveland expected to be missing two-time All-Star Darius Garland (toe) and Max Strus (foot) for extended periods, Mobley will be tasked with more offensive responsibilities than in previous years. After averaging 18.5 points, 9.3 boards, 0.9 steals and 1.6 blocks over 71 appearances last season, it wouldn't be surprising to see him eclipse 20.0 points and 10.0 rebounds while chipping in a steal and at least one block per contest. Now that Al Horford is no longer in Beantown, Queta is set to be the starting center for the Celtics in 2025-26. The Portugal native represented his country in EuroBasket 2025 this past summer, posting a stellar 23-point, 18-rebound outing in an upset victory over the reigning European champions Spain. This isn't to suggest Queta will be going off with similar performances in the NBA this season. What it does prove, however, is that he's a talented seven-footer who will earn the most playing time of his young career as he enters his fifth season. In 13.9 minutes per game last year, Queta averaged 5.0 points, 3.8 boards and 0.7 blocks, numbers that jump to 12.9 points, 9.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per 36 minutes. He probably won't see that much time on the court every night, but averaging a double-double with some defensive stats while shooting north of 60% from the field should absolutely be in the cards for the 26-year-old. Sensabaugh is entering his third season in the NBA. Historically speaking, players experience a breakthrough as a pro at this time in their careers. After suiting up for only 32 games as a rookie in 2023-24, he appeared in 71 contests for the Jazz last year and impressed over the final two months of the season. In 27 games after the All-Star break, Sensabaugh tallied 14.1 points, 3.7 boards, 2.1 assists and 0.7 steals on 47.4/47.5/86.7 shooting splits in just under 25 minutes per night. Utah made several moves in the offseason to make way for their young talent in 2025-26, and Sensabaugh stands to benefit as the starting small forward for coach Will Hardy in Year 3. During his lone preseason outing against Houston on October 8, Sensabaugh dropped 24 points (9-15 FG) with six made 3s, three rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 26 minutes. Much like Evan Mobley on this list, some readers may take umbrage with Thompson's placement as a breakout on this list after he seemingly did so last season by averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 boards, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks across 69 games as a sophomore. In Year 3, Amen is poised for another big jump, one that should land him firmly in the All-Star and Most Improved Player conversations. With the unfortunate news that Fred VanVleet could miss the entire 2025-26 campaign after tearing his ACL in late September, Thompson has the chance to earn heavy minutes as the lead ball-handler on a team featuring Kevin Durant, Alperen Sengun and Jabari Smith. As one of the most explosive athletes in the NBA, Thompson is a dynamic two-way force that will wreak havoc for the Rockets and provide stellar production in nearly every statistical category for fantasy managers. He may not necessarily help in terms of three-pointers or free-throw percentage, but his positional versatility, defensive stats and all-around game are too juicy to pass up. Heading into Year 2, Kel'el Ware looks ready to make an impact at both ends of the floor for the Heat. In somewhat of an up-and-down rookie season, the seven-footer started to show signs of growth over the last two months that he carried into Summer League and now the preseason. Over his final 26 contests in 2024-25, Ware averaged 10.3 points, 9.7 boards, 0.7 steals and 1.3 blocks in 26.8 minutes, compiling nine double-doubles in the process. Across three preseason appearances in 2025-26, Ware has recorded two double-doubles while scoring in double figures in each outing, and he's gone 6-for-12 on three-point attempts overall. In a loss to the Spurs on October 8, he erupted for 29 points (12-19 FG, 3-6 3Pt), 12 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 26 minutes of action. Targeting Ware towards the latter stages of drafts could pay huge dividends for managers, regardless of his status as a starter or reserve in Miami."}

Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024.

James, 40, signed a new contract with the Lakers in June and is set to become the first player to play across 23 separate NBA seasons. Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer.

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold.

James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games.

The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

Here are the various pathways for LeBron and the Lakers for the 2025-26 campaign.", "body": "Brian Windhorst analyzes LeBron James' \"The Second Decision\" ad, and Shams Charania gives an update on James' glute injury. (1:48) The only signs of LeBron James inside the locker room an hour before the Los Angeles Lakers ' preseason opener tipped off in Palm Desert, California, last week were his gold No. 23 uniform hanging in his cubby and a triangular foam cushion placed on the seat beneath it. The jersey would not be needed on this night. The cushion would. Of the 42 players listed on the Lakers' and Phoenix Suns' training camp rosters, 22 were born in the 2000s and 19 were born in the 1990s. And one, James, was born in 1984 -- five months before Suns head coach Jordan Ott. The 40-year-old James didn't play in the exhibition game after being limited to light shooting through the first three days of training camp because of nerve irritation in his glute, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. The cushion, though, worked a full night, as his seat in the locker room and during the game at the end of the bench. When James eventually emerged in the locker room, wearing a T-shirt with the \"Forever King\" tagline from his latest Nike ad campaign printed on the front, he was asked by a reporter if he was ready to begin an unprecedented 23rd season. Before James could answer, Lakers guard Austin Reaves chimed in. \"You got another five seasons in you,\" he said. James' eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face. \"Why not six or seven, get to 30?\" the reporter continued. \"Yeah, set a record!\" Reaves added. James turned toward Reaves and smirked: \"I already set a record.\" Indeed, there have been approximately 5,000 players to suit up in the NBA, and James is the only one to stick around for 23 seasons. He has also scored more regular-season points than anyone else in league history (42,184), scored more postseason points (8,289), made more All-Star games (21) and was a part of the first active father-son duo to share the court as players together when he and Bronny James checked in against the Minnesota Timberwolves on opening night last fall.

Wright Wemby, Luka, Ant? Examining the players primed to become the face of the NBA Zach Kram 2 Related The accomplishments -- including the four MVPs, four championships and four Finals MVPs -- are well-documented. But if L.A. represents the fourth quarter of James' career after the first three were spent in Cleveland, Miami and Cleveland once more, the question now is whether the clock is truly running out -- or if he will push this thing to overtime. As James embarks on his eighth season with the Lakers -- the longest consecutive stint he's had with any of the franchises he's played for -- he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time after he exercised his $52.6 million option for the 2025-26 season in June without negotiating for an extension. During the Lakers' annual media day last week, the first question James fielded was about retirement. \"I don't know,\" said James, who earned second-team All-NBA honors in his 22nd season. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to play the game that I love for another season. And however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested. Because, like you said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later.\" The Lakers, who will be without James for the next three to four weeks as he deals with sciatica in his right side, are coming off a season in which they traded for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic and secured the No. 3 seed in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. But they fell to the No. 6-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. After James opted into his contract to stay in L.A., his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, issued a statement to ESPN's Shams Charania that many interpreted as an indication that James could finish his career somewhere else. \"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. ... We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.\" And after having full control over his career for his first 22 years, what's best and what's realistic could prove to be at odds. Here are the four possible ways this unprecedented season could go for James and the Lakers. LeBron James is excited about his Lakers squad this season and isn't sweating being in a contract year. James' time with the Lakers has seen him battle a rash of injuries that caused him to miss 124 games in seven seasons after he had missed only 71 in his first 15 years in the league. The Lakers' brass has cycled through four head coaches and the front office has had a mixed record on its trades and signings. Still, there has been plenty of success. The Lakers won a championship in 2020, with James becoming the first player in history to take home Finals MVP for three different teams. The franchise celebrated James in grand fashion when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer in 2023. And in 2024, the Lakers used the No. 55 pick to draft Bronny, allowing James to achieve what he had stated as his last remaining priority when he told ESPN, \"I need to be on the floor with my boy.\" A few months before the 2024 draft, the Golden State Warriors inquired about trading for James. The Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested. After the trade talks had passed, James expressed his commitment to the franchise. \"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and [have] been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said. Lakers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka, speaking at his annual season-opening news conference a few days before media day, made it clear where the franchise stands. \"We would love if LeBron's story would be, he retired a Laker,\" Pelinka said. \"That would be a positive story.\" While several sources close to James have told ESPN that it is unknown how the end of his career will play out, it could help James' desire to play on the best Lakers' team possible this season if it appears he has more basketball in him.

The Lakers can trade either their 2031 or 2032 first-round pick this season and have the right to swap firsts in five seasons in any deals they pursue this season, but they could be reticent to use those assets to invest in a team built for Doncic and James, if James is on the way out. For those looking for clues, there are a few out there. The Nike \"Forever King\" ad features a narrator speaking about James' career in the past tense -- \"They called him the Chosen One ... We were all witnesses.\" The Cleveland Cavaliers' \"Classic Edition\" uniform for this season is the same style James wore when he came into the league as a rookie with the Cavs in 2003-04. The NBA schedule makers had L.A.'s first home game of the season and last road game of the season both be against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, a fitting way for the two most important players of their era to have a proper send-off, if James is indeed on his last lap. And after media day, on his Instagram account, James posted a compilation of moments from the day with Lenny Kravitz's \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" playing underneath, possibly hinting at the end. Pelinka's answer at the news conference about James retiring with the Lakers was telling because he answered a different question than he was asked. He was asked if the Lakers would be interested in re-signing James in the summer of 2026. L.A. is projected to have approximately $50 million in cap space, which would all be swallowed up by James if he was to seek a new max contract. James will be eligible to sign up to a three-year deal for $188 million, with a starting salary of $58.1 million for 2026-27, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks. As great as James has been, extending his prime well beyond any reasonable actuarial table, there is a natural question as to how his timeline syncs up with the team's two other best players, both of whom are in their mid 20s. Doncic and Reaves, for their part, love playing with James and want the partnership to continue, sources told ESPN. Both players have not inquired with James about when he plans to retire, sources said, wanting to show respect for James' process. Doncic, who idolized James growing up, has enjoyed their partnership and believes James is vital to L.A.'s ability to win now, sources said. He is also undaunted by any spectacle or circus that could come with pairing up with James as he closes out his career because Doncic already experienced an aging legend on his farewell tour when Dirk Nowitzki's last season with the Dallas Mavericks coincided with Doncic's rookie year. Doncic found the time with Nowitzki to be invaluable, sources said. Plus, if the Lakers happen to win the championship this season -- bringing James' career total to five -- would he see that as a perfect ending, or would he want to come back to try to defend it and tie Michael Jordan with six? Tim Bontemps remains unsure on whether LeBron James will continue to play for the Lakers beyond next season. Paul's statement to ESPN in June established James' final priority as the curtain falls on his career: to win. That means, if L.A. is struggling -- whether because of injuries, poor roster fits, or simply because the team isn't good enough to thrive in the crowded West -- James could opt to leave. Since James holds a no-trade clause in his contract, any deal would need a greenlight from James to be executed. The problem is, there are not many viable destinations for him. Play Fantasy Basketball this season • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Cleveland, which would represent a second and perhaps final homecoming, would need to send out nearly $90 million in salaries to make a trade work, according to Marks, and the deal would have to involve multiple teams because the Cavs are not allowed to be over the second apron in a James trade. Because of their apron limitations, the Cavs would also be prevented from signing James off the waiver wire if he reached a buyout with L.A. The Warriors and New York Knicks would also be ineligible to sign James in that scenario. Then there's the Mavericks. James has won titles with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving , and has close relationships with coach Jason Kidd and several members of Kidd's staff. But the Mavs, too, would need to send out an exorbitant amount of money to make a deal work, according to Marks. Dallas is also currently a second-apron team, and would need to trade $12 million in salary without taking any back in order to become a buyout destination for James. There are 10 teams projected to have significant cap space in the summer of 2026, including the Brooklyn Nets , LA Clippers and Chicago Bulls , and there could be options for James that are currently unforeseen. However, it would be a major life change to leave Southern California when Savannah (his wife) and Zhuri (his daughter) live there, Bronny is under contract with the Lakers, and Bryce (his son) is a short flight away at the University of Arizona. And James will be in a free agent pool that potentially includes other stars such as Kevin Durant , Trae Young and James Harden -- plus impact players such as Reaves, Draymond Green , Bradley Beal , Norman Powell and Coby White -- so it's not a given he would receive endless interest around the league. And so James' situation remains undecided, and it's yet to be determined whether his 23rd season will be a countdown toward the end of his career or merely the bridge to a 24th, or beyond. Or whether his body will make the decision for him. \"Everyone is trying to dictate when he's done and the reality is nobody actually knows,\" a source close to James told ESPN. James, for his part, says he isn't concerned with the future for now. \"Not worried about yesterday and not trying to focus on what the future holds,\" he told ESPN. \"It's about staying present. ... Because like I said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it is not as long [away as] 'The Godfather 2.' So I know I got to stay present.\""}

(0:58) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- While LeBron James is expected to be sidelined to begin the season as he recovers from sciatica on the right side of his body, the Los Angeles Lakers ' other superstar, Luka Doncic , said he doesn't feel compelled to do more in James' absence. \"I don't view it that way,\" Doncic said after practice Saturday. \"I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.\" So far without James and Doncic, the Lakers are winless in the preseason, going 0-2 against Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors . L.A. hosts Golden State in a preseason rematch Sunday, and Lakers coach JJ Redick said it is still being determined if Doncic will play. Sunday starts a stretch of three preseason games in four days for the Lakers, continuing with a road game against Phoenix on Tuesday and the second night of a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Redick said Doncic would play in two of L.A.'s remaining four preseason games. Doncic was a full participant on Saturday after having his workload modified all week to save the 26-year-old guard some wear and tear after he played for Slovenia in EuroBasket this summer. \"I had [the] national team,\" Doncic explained. \"Playing one month or something of basketball [for Slovenia]. Obviously it's a long season ahead, so just because of that.\" Now Redick has his work cut out for him trying to fill in for James while he is sidelined for the next three to four weeks before his sciatica is scheduled to be reevaluated. \"You hope that he's back soon,\" Redick said. \"Those things can be tricky. ... It is unclear what the starting lineup is going to be, that's the reality, until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.\" Doncic, guard Austin Reaves and center Deandre Ayton will occupy three of the five spots. It's the other two starting spots that Redick will examine, with Rui Hachimura starting 57 of the 59 games he played for L.A. last season under obvious consideration. Jarred Vanderbilt , who has started both preseason games so far and is the healthiest he has been since the Lakers' 2023 trip to the Western Conference finals and free agent signees Jake LaRavia and Marcus Smart give the team different options offensively and defensively. Smart, who has also been sidelined to start the preseason because of Achilles tendinopathy, will play against the Warriors, according to Redick. Redick said he has thought about having one lineup and rotation that fits best together when James plays and a separate one for when he doesn't. Doncic said he and James have \"talked a lot\" while observing the Lakers practice from the sidelines during training camp, which has helped with chemistry. For the time being, all Doncic and the Lakers will be getting out of James during games is what the 40-year-old can provide with his voice from the bench. \"It's a big change,\" Doncic said of having to play without James. \"He's a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be 'next man up.' We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be 'next man up.' That's it.\""}

The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks filed the lawsuit in August 2023, seeking more than $10 million in damages . The team alleged that the Raptors poached Ikechukwu Azotam, who worked for New York from 2020 to 2023, and ordered him to provide a trove of internal information after Toronto began recruiting him in the summer of 2023. The Knicks argued that this effort was geared toward giving the Raptors a competitive advantage. The Knicks specifically alleged that Azotam -- who worked for the team as an assistant video coordinator, then as a director of video/analytics/player development assistant -- sent the Raptors thousands of confidential files, including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The Knicks alleged that Azotam did so at the request of the Raptors, who they said were trying to \"organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff,\" the August 2023 complaint stated. The Raptors, Azotam, Toronto coach Darko Rajaković, player development coach Noah Lewis and 10 \"unknown\" employees were listed as defendants in the lawsuit. In an October 2023 court filing, the Raptors called the Knicks' allegations \"baseless\" and a \"public relations stunt.\" The Raptors argued that the \"alleged 'theft of data' involved little more than publicly available information compiled through public sources readily accessible to all NBA Members.\" The Raptors repeatedly called for NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in and settle the dispute, and a judge in the U.S. Southern District Court in Lower Manhattan agreed . The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, meaning it is dismissed permanently."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might have made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4-of-5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. He played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he would feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter by running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up, and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

(0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

He averaged 9.5 points and 4 assists in 23 playoff games to help the Pacers reach the NBA Finals. The Pacers were already short-handed at point guard with All-Star Tyrese Haliburton sidelined for the season because of a torn Achilles he suffered in the Pacers' Game 7 Finals loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Andrew Nembhard will start at point guard this season in Haliburton's absence. The Pacers open the regular season on Oct. 23 against the Thunder in a rematch of the Finals."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: Is there any hope for Joel Embiid and the Sixers?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-is-there-any-hope-for-joel-embiid-and-the-sixers/", "published_at": "2025-10-11T15:43:33+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Philadelphia 76ers, who are on the two-timeline plan", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Jared McCain's rookie season ended in mid-December of last year, but he still managed to play more minutes (592) than Joel Embiid did (574) for the 2024-25 Philadelphia 76ers . The same is true of reserves Jeff Dowtin Jr. (621), who was on a two-way contract and also played 17 games for the Sixers' G League team; Kyle Lowry (659), who barely played for the final three months; and Jared Butler (682), who joined the team at the trade deadline. In all, 15 players logged more minutes than Embiid did for last season's Sixers. The guy who played the fifth-most minutes, Ricky Council IV , is not currently on an NBA roster. (The Brooklyn Nets were reportedly going to bring him to camp if not for an injury.) Paul George missed half the games, too, and, by the end of the regular season, they were in full tank mode, trying to hang on to their top-six-protected pick. For a franchise that had invested about $400 million in Embiid and George the previous summer, it was an absolute nightmare. Good news, though: 2024-25 is over. The late tank worked, and, if you're a Sixers fan who hasn't already purchased a V.J. Edgecombe jersey, you've likely at least considered it. McCain will miss the start of the season because of a thumb injury, and neither George nor Embiid has played in the preseason, but, in theory, Philly will soon get a proper look at the team it has put together. The hope is that the ceiling is just as high as the Sixers envisioned when they're at full health and that the floor is nowhere near as low as it was last season. Last year: Just about everything that could do wrong did go wrong until the night of the lottery. The miserable, 24-win season did have some silver linings, though: Tyrese Maxey improved his point-of-attack defense, McCain looked like the Rookie of the Year during the brief period in which he was healthy and Quentin Grimes , acquired for Caleb Martin at the deadline, played like the guy the Knicks didn't want to trade for Donovan Mitchell four years ago . Guerschon Yabusele becoming a fan favorite and Justin Edwards emerging late in the season were small victories, too. The offseason: They grabbed Edgecombe with the No. 3 pick, used the No. 35 pick on stretch big Johni Broome and re-signed Edwards for three years and $7.1 million with a team option. They also re-signed Eric Gordon and Lowry and signed Trendon Watford away from Brooklyn, all on minimum contracts. Yabusele left for the Knicks , and they used two of their two-way slots on Jabari Walker and Dominick Barlow, who might have a chance to take some of his minutes. After a long standoff, Grimes signed the one-year qualifying offer. Las Vegas over/under: 42.5 wins, per BetMGM Sixers believer: Nothing about last season was fun in Philadelphia, but, with the exception of winning a championship, it was the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. By bottoming out, the Sixers were able to draft V.J. Edgecombe, who is probably a future star and definitely going to help them immediately. Daryl Morey's front office also learned from all the things that went wrong in 2024-25, as they've put together a significantly younger, more athletic roster than they had a year ago. Everyone except Tom Ziller seems afraid to say it, but the 2025-26 Sixers can be contenders if they are relatively healthy this time around. I know you're about to hit me with the same tired, boring \"Joel Embiid can't be relied upon anymore\" take that I've heard a million times, but once he's back on the court and looking like himself again, you'll change your tune. Sixers skeptic: The reason you've heard so many people say Embiid can't be relied upon anymore is not that there's some sort of anti-Philadelphia conspiracy going around. It's just the truth, no matter how much you and I wish it were not. The Sixers drafted Embiid 11 years ago, and the only time he has ever finished a season healthy was 2019-20 in the bubble. Embiid himself has acknowledged that playing through his knee injury -- and Bell's palsy -- in the 2024 playoffs was not the wisest decision. What scares me the most about Embiid is not that he barely played basketball last season, but the way he moved when he did play. At this point, I don't understand how anyone could be confident that he'll get back to an MVP level, let alone sustain it. Sixers believer: I'm assuming you agree with this statement about Embiid: \"Everyone has to consider the possibility that no surgery and rehabilitation, no matter how cautious and thorough, will ever be enough to keep him on the court for long.\" Sixers skeptic: Yeah, obviously. Sixers believer: Great. It's from a Philadelphia Inquirer article that is more than 10 years old . Before you write off Embiid, please remember that, before he had played a single second in the NBA, plenty of people were doing the same thing. His injury history has always been a cause for concern, but he has already overcome it to be named an All-Star seven years in a row and win an MVP award. Please don't act shocked if and when he makes this sentiment seem foolish again. Sixers skeptic: Can we talk about the rest of the team? There are only so many ways to say that Embiid is a massive question mark, and pointing out that the organization has been walking this tightrope for more than a decade definitely doesn't make me feel any better about it. Weren't you a little spooked when, with Embiid and Tyrese Maxey out of the lineup, Paul George scored a measly two points on 1-for-7 shooting in 36 minutes in Brooklyn in February? How do you feel about George having arthroscopic knee surgery in the summer and Jared McCain vlogging about another injury ? I get the Edgecombe excitement, but aren't you a little disappointed that the Sixers didn't keep Guerschon Yabusele or re-sign Quentin Grimes on a long-term contract? It's hard for me to flush last season when this season's vibes are already weird. Sixers believer: Actually, I have some questions for you about the San Antonio Spurs : Weren't you spooked by how inefficient De'Aaron Fox was in the 17 games he played for them last season? How do you feel about him missing all of preseason -- and probably some real games -- because of a hamstring injury? It's not a great sign that Stephon Castle is already dealing with a bruised knee, is it? Are you sure that Victor Wembanyama is going to stay healthy after missing almost half of last season? To be clear, I'm not seriously saying that everybody should be freaking out about the Spurs, but it's annoying that McCain had thumb surgery just three weeks after No. 2 pick Dylan Harper did and only the former is treated like a bad omen. Let's respect the Sixers' history of genuinely insane stuff happening by not overreacting to minor snags! And by the way, San Antonio's crowded backcourt and collective lack of shooting are bigger problems than any non-health-related issue with Philly's roster, and the Sixers have the benefit of playing in the East. George is 35, but the fact that he remained an elite defender last season indicates that his decline has been greatly exaggerated (as has the importance of that one game in which he was dealing with three separate injuries). McCain won't miss many games that matter. Grimes can still re-sign next summer, and, as much as I'll miss Yabu, I expect Trendon Watford to more or less make up for his absence. Sixers skeptic: If every single Spurs player except Wemby tears his Achilles next week, I'd still feel better about their future than Philadelphia's. There's no double standard here; one of these teams has the brightest future imaginable and the other one will be paying Embiid and George about $120 million combined in 2027-28. What sucks the most about the position the Sixers are in is that, if you ignore those two signings, they've made some amazing moves over the last few years! They got Maxey with the No. 21 pick, McCain with the No. 16 pick and Edgecombe with a pick they weren't really supposed to have. The Grimes trade was highway robbery, the Kelly Oubre Jr . signing (and re-signing) worked out as well as they could have hoped and Justin Edwards looks like a nice find. Adem Bona might be, too, and, after Yabusele (another smart signing) walked, it made sense to pick up Watford. Unfortunately, though, there's no mechanism for a clean transition to the post-Embiid era, so the Sixers are stuck doing the two-timelines thing. This has already cost them. While it's understandable that they wanted to stay under the first apron and maintain their ability to get under the tax with a trade, these constraints prevented them from paying Yabusele and Grimes what they're worth. Compromising in that way was a tell: No matter what Morey says, the organization isn't really all-in on this group anymore. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors agreed to voluntarily dismiss a lawsuit alleging the Raptors stole thousands of confidential files from the Knicks, according to a court filing obtained by ESPN . The teams dismissed the suit with prejudice, permanently ending the legal dispute. The case was initially set to be settled this summer , nearly two years after the Knicks filed the suit in August 2023 . \"The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved,\" team spokespersons said to ESPN. \"The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks alleged in the 2023 lawsuit that the Raptors recruited Ikechukwu Azotam -- who worked as the Knicks' assistant video coordinator -- and ordered him to send them confidential material including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research. The team sought $10 million in damages . The Knicks alleged that the Raptors, who had recently hired coach Darko Rajaković, \"conspired to use Azotam's position as a current Knicks insider to funnel proprietary information to the Raptors to help them organize, plan, and structure the new coaching and video operations staff.\" The Raptors in October 2023 filed a motion to dismiss, argued that the claims were \"baseless\" and said the information was publicly available to all NBA members. They asked NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in, and a U.S. District Court judge ruled last year , to the Knicks' chagrin, that Silver should resolve the dispute. He was set to oversee the settlement in an arbitration meeting in July. It is a rare occurrence for NBA teams to sue one another. The only other known case came in 1977 when the Knicks were involved in a dispute with the Nets . They claimed that the Nets' attempted move from Long Island to New Jersey infringed on their territorial rights, and the Nets sued and claimed the Knicks were violating antitrust laws. The NBA and state of New Jersey settled the dispute, and the Nets paid the Knicks $4 million for the right to move. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Strahinja Jokić, the older brother of Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokić, pleaded guilty Friday to charges stemming from a fight that occurred during an NBA playoff game in April 2024. He pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing and one count of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to one year of probation. The incident drew widespread attention after a short video of the altercation circulated on social media following the Nuggets' Game 2 win against the Los Angeles Lakers last postseason. The clip, which was later cited in a police statement of probable cause, appeared to show a verbal exchange between the Jokić brothers and a fan before one of the brothers struck the man in the face. One of Nikola Jokic’s older brothers punched a fan after last night’s Nuggets and Lakers game. 😳 (via cgallegos67/TT) pic.twitter.com/JdpNLxxjg0 Investigators identified Strahinja Jokić as the person who threw the punch. According to police documents , he told officers he \"felt he'd done nothing wrong because he was 'defending an older man that he has known for a long time.'\" The older Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault but ultimately pleaded guilty to lesser offenses as part of a resolution to the case. The incident did not involve his younger brother, Nikola, who was on the court at the time of the playoff game. Jokić's older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, are regular fixtures courtside at Nuggets games and have been protective presences throughout Nikola's career. It's not the first time Strahinja has faced legal trouble in Denver. In 2019, he was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman during an altercation inside an apartment. He was charged with second-degree assault , false imprisonment and obstruction of phone service, later pleading guilty in 2020 to felony trespassing and a misdemeanor count of obstruction. The remaining charges were dismissed. The Jokić brothers have also been involved in several public incidents tied to Nikola's on-court altercations. In 2021, they traded social media messages with NBA players Marcus Morris and Markieff Morris after a scuffle between Nikola and Markieff during a game against the Miami Heat . That same year, video surfaced of Strahinja and Nemanja shouting at Phoenix Suns players from the stands following a hard foul involving Nikola during the playoffs. While Nikola Jokić has largely stayed clear of controversy, his brothers' passionate support has at times drawn attention away from the three-time MVP's dominance on the court. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Former NBA star Paul Pierce was arrested Tuesday night on suspicion of driving under the influence after being found asleep behind the wheel on a Los Angeles highway, according to the California Highway Patrol. Officers were responding to an unrelated multi-vehicle crash that temporarily closed several lanes of the northbound freeway. As traffic lanes reopened, officers noticed a Range Rover stopped in the road south of the crash site. When approached, Pierce was asleep in the driver's seat, and officers observed signs of alcohol impairment, according to a CHP news release. Pierce was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor driving under the influence and booked at the CHP's Central Los Angeles Area office. The case will be reviewed by the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. Pierce gave his side of the story in an Instagram post , saying he fell asleep after \"being stuck in standstill traffic for 45 minutes.\" \"I'm old, I'm tired and I fell asleep,\" Pierce wrote. \"I'm good y'all thanks for the love.\" A post shared by The Truth (@paulpierce) Pierce, 47, played 19 seasons in the NBA, including 15 with the Boston Celtics . He also had stints with the Brooklyn Nets , Washington Wizards and finished his career with the Los Angeles Clippers before retiring in 2017. A 10-time All-Star and NBA Finals MVP in 2008, Pierce was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021. Pierce starred at Inglewood High School and was a McDonald's All-American in 1995 before playing college basketball at the University of Kansas. Drafted 10th overall in 1998 by the Celtics, Pierce became one of the franchise's most decorated players, helping lead Boston to the 2008 NBA championship.

It may just be the preseason, but third-year Oklahoma City Thunder guard Cason Wallace is already achieving the improbable. Wallace beat the shot clock with one of the most ridiculous shots possible in his team's win against the Charlotte Hornets . With just over 10:30 remaining in the third quarter, Thunder forward Jaylin Williams launched a desperation 3 as time expired on an Oklahoma City possession. It missed the basket, but Wallace was in the perfect spot along the baseline to heave a prayer as the buzzer rang out. That prayer was answered when his miraculous heave went over the backboard and into the basket.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . It's one thing to lose in the NLDS after entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. It's quite another to be eliminated in the most heartbreaking fashion imaginable , which is what happened to the Phillies in Game 4. After Philadelphia fought into the 11th inning of a pitcher's duel, the Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the frame. Andy Pages hit a little nubber back to the mound, and instead of trying for the out a first base, Orion Kerkering threw the ball away at home plate. Asked for his thoughts on the play after the game, Kerkering faced the harsh reality : \"This really f---ing sucks right now.\" Once the sting of this one starts to wear off, the Phillies will have to look ahead to an offseason full of unknowns . In particular, free agency could bring big changes to the Philly clubhouse. As R.J. Anderson writes, a few key players are set to hit the market, and the Phillies must decide whether they're willing to pony up in order to retain them. Misery loves company, and the Phillies weren't alone in the City of Brotherly Love . The Eagles lost to the Giants , and the Flyers dropped their season-opener. That's just the second time all three teams have lost on the same day. At least the 76ers didn't lose. Allow me to play the role of Captain Obvious and point out the LeBron James ' injury is a big blow for the Lakers as they begin the 2025-26 season. For more insightful reaction and analysis, we turn to CBS Sports NBA expert Sam Quinn. Could this James injury open the door to more playing time for Bronny James ? Who will start in place of the four-time MVP? These are some of the questions Quinn wrestles with in his piece on the ripple effects of James' absence , but the most intriguing question is whether this boosts Luka Dončić 's bid for the MVP. Even before this injury to James, there was some question about whether the Lakers added enough around Dončić to be true NBA title contenders. That question is only more pertinent now. Just as everyone predicted, the Giants faced the Eagles as 7.5-point underdogs and came away with a 34-17 win . As has been the case for the last few weeks, Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo led the way for New York on the field and in the vibes department. Right from the jump, Dart and Skattebo were locked in as they tormented Vic Fangio 's defense. Dart finished the night with 253 total yards and two touchdowns. Skattebo piled up 110 total yards and three scores. Those numbers are great, but they don't even tell the full story. In last week's loss to the Saints , Dart committed three turnovers, and the Giants committed five as a team. Those tanked their chance to win on the road (duh), but New York committed zero turnovers on Thursday. Dart's ability to avoid those negative and disastrous plays only enhance what's in the box score. The duo of Dart and Skattebo has a bright future, but they're already doing big things in the present. Jordan Dajani explains the multiple ways in which that big blue tandem made some history last night.

To be determined", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/article/luka-doncic-finally-play-preseason-232026872.html", "published_at": "2025-10-11T23:20:26+00:00", "domain": "yahoo.com", "summary": "Coach JJ Redick and the Lakers' superstar say he'll definitely play in the preseason, but it's unclear if it will be Sunday vs. Golden State.", "body": "Manage your account ... At some point during the Lakers ’ preseason, Luka Doncic will play in a game. The question is when. Even after being a full participant in practice Saturday, Lakers coach JJ Redick said that Doncic was “TBD” (to be determined) when asked if his star guard would play in Sunday’s exhibition game against the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. Redick said Austin Reaves will play and that Marcus Smart will see action in his first preseason game of the season. The Lakers will play six preseason games, three of them coming after the game against the Warriors. After practice, Doncic was asked when he would play. Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue “I don’t know yet,” he said. “We got to talk about it — JJ and my team. So, I don’t know yet. But I’m probably going to end up playing two games of the preseason.” When the regular season starts Oct. 21 at home against the Warriors, Doncic will not have running mate LeBron James beside him. James was diagnosed with sciatica nerve issue on his right side, the Lakers announced to the media Thursday, saying that he’ll be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks. James and Doncic formed a great partnership when they played together after the shocking blockbuster trade last February. Not having James to start the season has to be unsettling for Doncic and the Lakers. “It’s a big change,” Doncic said. “He’s a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be next man up. We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be next man up. That’s it.” Doncic will get plenty of help from Reaves, Smart, Deandre Ayton, Jared Vanderbilt and others with James out. Still, the assumption is that Doncic will have to carry a heavy load with James sidelined. “No. I don’t view it that way,” Doncic said. “I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.” James hasn’t practiced at all, but Doncic said that hasn’t stopped the two of them from figuring out the team can still function at a high level. “It’s not everything about on the court. That’s what I’ve been saying,” Doncic said. “It’s about chemistry off the court, too. So, obviously, now it’s a little more off the court, but while we watched practices this week, we talked a lot about it.” They had known over the summer that James had been dealing with “the nerve irritation,” Redick said, and so it wasn’t a total surprise James is going to be out with a sciatica issue. Redick said James has been on the court “every day” doing individual work. He just hasn’t been able to practice with his teammates. Redick was asked how James' inability to participate in practice affected his game planning for practice and going into the season knowing that he won’t be available for a while. \" No, no effect on practice planning,” Redick said. “And we haven't game-planned yet, so, no effect.” Redick had not put too much emphasis on his starting lineup during training camp and during the preseason games. But with James turning 41 in December, entering his 23rd season and being injured in training camp, Redick was asked if he could foresee having a lineup with James starting and another with him out. \" Potentially. Yeah,” he said. “Something that certainly has crossed my mind in the last couple days. Yeah…You hope that he's back soon. That's, those things are, those things can be tricky. So it, I don't think it's … “We knew this going into camp, so it wasn't like it's changed anything for how we want to practice or what our philosophies are with the preseason games. It is unclear who's gonna be, what the starting lineup is gonna be. That's the reality until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A spokesperson for the teams gave ESPN this statement: “The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved. The Parties are focused on the future.” The lawsuit was over something seen as commonplace in NBA circles (sources who had been in similar jobs told NBC Sports at the time that this was no big deal and the suit seemed “very James Dolan”). New York was seeking $10 million in damages from Toronto for the alleged “theft of trade secrets” when the Raptors hired away New York’s director of video/analytics/and a player development assistant coach, Ikechukwu Azotam. In the suit, the Knicks alleged that the Raptors organization — at the behest of rookie head coach Darko Rajakovic — took more than 3,000 confidential, proprietary files, including video scouting files and play frequency numbers. Part of the Knicks’ argument was that Rajakovic didn’t have the depth of background to build a team structure, so he stole that from New York. That despite the fact that Rajakovic had been a legendary head coach in Serbia, was head coach of the Tulsa 66ers of the G-League, and was an assistant known for player development with the Thunder, Suns and Grizzlies. Toronto’s first counterargument was that this had to be decided by the NBA league office and commissioner Adam Silver, not the courts. Toronto reached out to the NBA’s general council and pointed out that the NBA’s constitution (Article 24, bylaw “D”) states: “The Commissioner shall have exclusive, full, complete, and final jurisdiction of any dispute involving two (2) or more Members of the Association.” Dolan, who has had a long-running feud with Silver, did not feel the commissioner would be an unbiased arbiter of the situation. In the end, both sides just decided to drop the issue and move on. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Brandin Podziemski recently stated his desire to earn that prestigious role , displaying a level of ambition that is appreciated by general manager Mike Dunleavy.

So, we just want to focus on this year, putting together the best team we can do and we'll kind of cross the bridge of everything else as it goes.\" Podziemski voiced his lofty goal during an exclusive interview with The Athletic's Nick Friedell , detailing how warning that trust goes beyond just his skill on the court. “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told Friedell. “How can I have their trust?

The 22-year-old guard followed that up with another solid performance in his sophomore season, posting 11.7 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game in 64 appearances. While Podziemski certainly has displayed the desired traits you'd seek in a leader, his long-term role will be sorted out when the time comes.

He has the backing of the last guy to have the job, Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “I mean, Spo is incredible. He’s a phenomenal coach,” Kerr said after a Warriors practice Friday . “And, just watching him the last two summers and getting to know him up close, rather than just from afar, where I’ve admired him for so long, I got a first-hand glimpse at what a great coach he is.” Spoelstra was one of the assistant coaches on Kerr’s staff for the Paris Olympics, where Team USA won its fifth consecutive gold medal. That staff was also together for the World Cup in the Philippines the year before. Kerr said being an assistant coach for Team USA matters before moving over to the big chair. “I think the assistant coaching is almost a prerequisite for coaching USA,” Kerr said. “It’s really a different job, and now he has that experience, just like I did with [Gregg Popovich], in the World Cup in ’19 and the Olympics in ’21. “Spo is a perfect choice. He’s gonna be great.” Spoelstra is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA, entering his 18th season, and has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (2012 and 2013). In a sign of how respected he is around the league, a poll of NBA GMs voted him the “best coach in the NBA” as well as the best manager and motivator of players. Spoelstra’s contract with USA Basketball is not finalized and has to be approved by the organization’s board of directors, but that is all expected to be wrapped up before the end of the month.

See which current stars and emerging names will lead the next generation of fantasy hoops.", "body": "Figuring out where to rank players is difficult enough in any particular season. But how about doing it with an eye towards what the NBA may look like in five years? That’s the point of this exercise, with Rotoworld basketball writers Raphielle Johnson and Noah Rubin combining to put together their top-25 fantasy list for 2030. While the list is primarily populated with players currently in the NBA, there are a few who have yet to play an official NBA game. Some players, whether in the NBA now or yet to reach that point, will break through by 2030. Here’s our top 25, and it should not be surprising who leads the way. Age (as of October 10): 21 After taking the NBA by storm as a rookie, Wembanyama’s impact was muted last season due to a blood clot that sidelined him from the All-Star break onward. The 7-foot-3 phenom has been given a clean bill of health and is poised to usher in a new era in the NBA. Before his season-ending injury in February, Wembanyama averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.1 steals, 3.8 blocks and 3.1 three-pointers per game with 47.6/35.2/83.6 shooting splits. Age: 18 Flagg has yet to play in an official NBA game, but the incoming rookie is deserving of being high on any list that’s looking ahead to five years from now. He won’t turn 19 until just before Christmas, making it possible (likely, even) that the Mavericks forward still will not have reached his prime by 2030. He’s got all the skills a franchise could want in a cornerstone, which is a void the Mavericks need to fill after trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers. Cooper Flagg was EVERYWHERE during his preseason debut 🔥🔥🔥 10p/6r/3a/1b in 14 minutes pic.twitter.com/p8CGp8A6mF Age: 27 Gilgeous-Alexander, who won NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Finals MVP honors while leading the Thunder to their first title last season, is still not 30 years old. Yet it feels like he’s been around for far longer than that, with the Canadian point guard being the 11th overall pick in the 2018 draft. Who knows how many titles and individual accolades he’ll have on his résumé by the time 2030 rolls around, but SGA should remain one of the best assets in fantasy basketball. Age: 24 Cunningham’s production has increased in each of his four NBA seasons, with the 2024-25 campaign being the one in which his growth coincided with that of the franchise he leads. Appearing a career-best 70 games, Cunningham averaged 26.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 9.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.1 three-pointers. The Pistons point guard recorded career-high averages in points, assists, blocks and three-pointers with a 46.9/35.6/84.6 shooting split. If Cunningham can keep the turnovers in check, as he averaged 4.4 per game last season, he’ll be an even better player to have rostered in fantasy leagues. Age: 26 Like many who follow basketball, Dončić was stunned when the Mavericks traded him to the Lakers in late January. He appeared in a career-low 50 games in 2024-25, appearing in 60 or more in each of his first six seasons. While LeBron James remains active currently, the Lakers have already made it clear that the franchise has begun the “Dončić Era,” and this summer, he signed an extension that runs through the 2028-29 campaign. As long as Luka is healthy, he’ll be one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 Mobley’s fourth NBA season was his best, with the Cavaliers forward/center averaging 18.5 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 0.9 steals, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 three-pointers per game. His role on the offensive end of the floor expanded in the first season of Kenny Atkinson’s tenure as head coach, and there’s still plenty of room for growth. The only question is what will Cleveland’s frontcourt look like in 2030. Will Mobley continue to share the court with another big man, as he currently does with Jarrett Allen ? Or will he shift to center full-time? Age: 24 Like Mobley, Edwards’ position could change by the time the year 2030 rolls around. Current Timberwolves starting point guard Mike Conley turns 38 on October 11, meaning there could come a point in the near future where Edwards is either sharing the backcourt with Rob Dillingham or being utilized as an uber-athletic scoring point guard. Whatever is decided, Ant-Man has the skill needed to be a cornerstone for his franchise and fantasy rosters. Age: 23 Şengün, who led Türkiye to a silver medal at EuroBasket this past summer, turned 23 in late July. While his scoring average decreased by two points compared to his 2023-24 number, the Rockets center earned his first All-Star Game appearance last season and averaged a double-double for the first time in four NBA seasons. Şengün’s all-around skill set makes him a center who should be highly valuable in fantasy leagues five years from now, especially if he were to develop a more reliable perimeter shot. Age: 22 After taking on a supplementary role as a rookie, the versatile Thompson figured more prominently in the Rockets’ rotation last season. And with Fred VanVleet sidelined by a torn ACL, the 2025-26 season could be a preview of what’s to come for Thompson. Compared to his rookie season, the 6-foot-7 wing’s averages improved in all major categories while shooting nearly 56 percent from the field. Like Şengün, Thompson is in a position where things could get truly scary if he’s able to develop a consistent perimeter shot over the next five years. Age: 23 The biggest concern for Holmgren is the injuries. After sitting out the entire 2022-23 season with a foot injury, he was limited to 32 games last season by a broken hip. Sandwiched in between those two seasons was a 2023-24 campaign in which Holmgren did not miss a game. When on the floor, he’s a gifted frontcourt player who can be used at power forward or center, and that versatility will serve Holmgren well over the next five years. Age: 23 Like Holmgren, availability has been an issue for Johnson during the early stages of his NBA career. He’s appeared in more than 60 games just once and is coming off a 2024-25 campaign in which he was limited to 36 appearances. However, Johnson did finish last season with career-high averages in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots while shooting 50 percent from the field. As long as he stays relatively healthy, the tools are there for Johnson to be a highly impactful fantasy player in 2030. Age: 18 Peterson is the first of three players on this list who have yet to play a college game, much less enter the NBA. But the Kansas freshman is that good. A combo guard who can play on or off the ball, the 6-foot-5 Peterson is on the short list of many regarding the top draft-eligible prospects for 2026. Winner of the 2025 Naismith Trophy Boys School Player of the Year award, Peterson was also a McDonald’s All-American this past season. High praise from Coach B 🙌 Our 2011-12 @Werner_Safety Naismith Men’s College COY shares how impressed he is with incoming Freshman Darryn Peterson. 👀 pic.twitter.com/YZrxWsxzZM Age: 24 Maxey, who will turn 25 in early November, has averaged 25.9 and 26.3 points per game over the last two seasons. While there are significant questions regarding teammate Joel Embiid’s injury history, the 2024-25 campaign was the first in which Maxey failed to play at least 60 games. In five years’ time, he should be the cornerstone in Philadelphia and an elite player worthy of first-round consideration, regardless of league format. Age: 18 The 6-foot-9 Boozer, whose father Carlos enjoyed a 13-year NBA career, was a two-time winner of the Gatorade National Player of the Year award while in high school. The combination of build, athleticism and skill set makes the younger Boozer a player capable of playing anywhere in the frontcourt, and that versatility tends to make for an excellent fantasy option. Like Peterson and another player a little further down on this list, Boozer is projected to be among the top draft-eligible talents for 2026. Age: 25 While it remains to be seen how Haliburton’s recovery from a ruptured Achilles tendon will go, he’s already one of the best players in fantasy basketball when healthy. Last season, he averaged 18.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, 9.2 assists, 1.4 steals, 0.7 blocks and 3.0 three-pointers per game while leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000. He’ll miss the entire 2025-26 campaign, but Haliburton should remain one of the best players in fantasy basketball in 2030. Age: 24 After three seasons in which he played at least 70 games, Wagner suffered an oblique injury that limited him to 60 appearances last season. However, he was excellent when on the floor, providing fourth-round value in eight- and nine-cat formats. A healthy Wagner can be an even greater asset, regardless of league format, because of his efficiency and versatile game. Like a few of the players above him on this list, Wagner needs to improve his perimeter shot, as he’s shot 28.1 and 29.5 percent from three over the past two seasons. Age: 24 The reigning champion Thunder have three players on this list, and none are over 27 years old. Williams can be plugged in just about anywhere within a lineup; that’s how versatile his game is. Due to injuries, he even spent some time at the center position last season. Williams’ averages have increased in each of his three NBA seasons, and he earned third-team All-NBA and second-team All-Defense honors in 2024-25. He won’t be 30 years old until the latter stages of the 2030-31 regular season and still has not begun his athletic prime. Age: 27 Like Haliburton, Tatum is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during last season’s playoffs. However, the Celtics star’s recovery will be interesting to watch, as he has not been officially ruled out for the 2025-26 season. Will Tatum attempt to return? And how would that impact the next five years of his NBA career? Tatum already has eight NBA seasons under his belt, but he has the skill set that can make him a serious factor in fantasy basketball when 2030 rolls around. Age: 18 The third and final current collegian on this list, Dybantsa will also be in contention to go first overall in next summer’s draft if he declares. The 6-foot-10 forward will be the biggest story in the state of Utah this season, especially with the Jazz in the midst of a rebuild. Dybantsa was the top-ranked prospect in the Class of 2025 and is a three-time FIBA gold medalist. Dybantsa’s explosive athleticism and varied skill set make him a player who can have a significant impact in fantasy basketball by the time 2030 rolls around. AJ Dybantsa made his BYU debut tonight at Marriott Madness 🔥 @MarchMadnessMBB pic.twitter.com/yGdZqWHRBz Age: 19 The second overall pick in the 2025 draft, the 6-foot-6 Harper can be used anywhere on the perimeter. During his lone season at Rutgers, he spent most of his time on the ball but can also take on an off-ball role. On a Spurs roster that includes Wembanyama, De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle , that may be something Harper has to do early on, but he’s capable of progressing into a lead playmaker role over the next five seasons. Age: 22 The 6-foot-10 Banchero has recorded increased points and rebounds averages in each of his three NBA seasons, but turnovers have limited his impact in fantasy basketball, especially in category leagues. However, that should not be the case in 2030, when Banchero may be beginning his athletic prime. Five years from now, this spot on the list may prove to be egregiously low for Banchero. Age: 24 Despite his age, Ball has already played five NBA seasons. However, while production has not been an issue for the Hornets’ point guard, staying on the court has. The 2021-22 season is the only one in which Ball has played at least 60 games; he’s appeared in 47 or fewer in each of the last three. The injury concerns have knocked Ball down many fantasy draft boards; hopefully, that won’t be an issue five years from now. Age: 30 Jokić is the only player on this list aged 30 years or older. However, the skill set and elite production cannot be ignored, especially for a player whose game is not reliant on “jump out of the gym” athleticism. The Joker has been the top-ranked player in fantasy basketball in per-game value in four of the last five seasons, and no lower than second in totals in six straight. Will Jokić still be in the NBA in five years’ time? We’ll see, but the track record of excellence is why he has to be on this list. Age: 24 After earning his first All-Star Game appearance in 2023-24, Barnes recorded similar numbers last season. And he’s capable of doing more, provided he becomes a more consistent shooter. Barnes shot 27.1 percent from three last season and is a career 30 percent shooter from deep on 3.6 attempts per game. He doesn’t have to turn into the next Stephen Curry , but consistent shooting would improve Barnes’ fantasy profile, given what he can already do as a playmaker and defender. Age: 27 Young has played 73 games or more in three of the last four seasons, and most recently, he led the NBA in assists. Having averaged a points/assists double-double each of the last three seasons, the Hawks’ point guard can remain a fantasy force for years to come. Something to watch is how young players like Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels progress, as their development may benefit Young in the turnover category. He’s averaged at least four per game each of the last six seasons, lowering Young’s value in nine-cat formats. A Division of NBCUniversal .

There is notable mutual interest between Sacramento and the nine-time All-Star, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Friday on \"NBA Today.\" \"I'm told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings,\" Charania said. \"The Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that and he has got relationships across that organization.

We'll see if a deal gets done before the season or during the upcoming year.\" Westbrook's decorated resume speaks for itself, with an NBA MVP and two scoring titles to his name. While the 37-year-old guard is a ways removed from his prime, Westbrook appears to still have plenty left in the tank after serving as a vital cog in the Denver Nuggets' rotation during the 2024-25 NBA season. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game in 75 appearances for Denver in his last campaign, shooting 44.9 percent from the floor and 32.3 percent from deep. The Kings signed Schröder to a three-year contract that likely slots him into Sacramento's starting point guard role, but the addition of Westbrook could prove to be a vital step in insulating the team's backcourt for the marathon that is the NBA season. Sacramento opens the regular season on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 22. Whether or not Westbrook will be in a Kings jersey by then remains to be seen, but it certainly is something to keep an eye on going forward. Download and follow The Deuce & Mo Podcast"}

They also stayed winless in the preseason, falling to a 128-98 loss to the Magic in their first exhibition game at Xfinity Mobile Arena. VJ Edgecombe sat because of left hip soreness. He took part in the Sixers’ morning shootaround and is considered day-to-day, according to a team official. Other absences included Joel Embiid (left knee), Paul George (left knee), Trendon Watford (right hamstring) and Jared McCain (right thumb). Quentin Grimes was inactive two days after his first practice of the season. The Sixers will hold their annual Blue-White scrimmage Sunday and finish their four-game preseason next Friday vs. the Timberwolves. Here are observations on the team's loss to Orlando: Tyrese Maxey and Dominick Barlow were early standouts. The Sixers’ first basket came on a Maxey transition three-pointer. To no one’s surprise, Maxey came out aggressively. He fired up nine shots in under seven minutes and played with tons of speed and confidence. Maxey poured in 17 first-quarter points and watched the rest of the game. three ball courtesy of @TyreseMaxey 👌 pic.twitter.com/2f5ggfpiuc Barlow scored the Sixers’ next bucket on a put-back layup. He did strong work on the offensive boards in his third straight start and had 12 points and nine rebounds over 29 minutes. Barlow has a 7-foot-3 wingspan and good athletic tools, and he’s rebounded the way those on-paper traits would suggest. Notably, the Sixers plan to be a guard-heavy team and know they must improve their rebounding. Barlow’s boosted his case for minutes with his preseason showing on the glass. Well done for a 22-year-old on a two-way contract. Not for the first time, Adem Bona had a rough start on the foul front. He committed two personals in under two minutes, including on a Wendell Carter Jr. and-one jumper. Of course, the other side of Bona’s ball-hungry defensive style is that he’s often rewarded with rejections. His bounce and rim-protecting instincts popped as usual. Bona swatted Desmond Bane, Paolo Banchero and Anthony Black layup attempts in the first half. Bona with the denial! 🚫 pic.twitter.com/XYS4Kd1LQN Andre Drummond continued to play behind Bona. The highlights of Drummond's night were a pair of corner three-pointers. Drummond made three long-range jumpers and missed 17 last season. He’s 18 for 140 (12.9 percent) in his career. Hunter Sallis received first-quarter minutes and got an and-one runner to drop against fellow rookie guard Jace Richardson. The Wake Forest product tallied seven points and three assists in 34 minutes. The Sixers used a five-man bench in the first half of Sallis, Drummond, Kennedy Chandler, Jabari Walker and Johni Broome. Emoni Bates and Malcolm Hill checked in after halftime. Broome (six points, three steals) played at both power forward and center. He had some tough moments defensively against players like Banchero and Carter. Banchero tried to drive baseline past Broome and throw down a powerful slam. Broome stopped him with a clear-cut foul. The 23-year-old lefty's physicality and shot blocking were strengths in college. It’s an open question how he’ll adapt to NBA-level size, quickness and leaping. Chandler was the Sixers' lead ball handler for much of the game and had a 16-point, five assist, four-steal night. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse has given him significant minutes in all three of the team's preseason contests. “ He’s played very well,” Nurse said following the Sixers' practice Thursday. “ He’s got pretty good feel for running and organizing the team. He’s also got some juice to get by people and get to the basket. And he’s also a very good shooter. “ He didn’t shoot as much from three in those games as he’s been doing in practice. He’s a legit threat from three. ... I’ve been impressed with his knowledge of the game, the way he’s picked things up and the way he’s transferred that to keeping the team fairly organized.”"}

Even for Antetokounmpo.", "body": "Talks in August between the Knicks and Bucks about a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade never gained real traction. That shouldn’t be a real surprise. If the Bucks are forced to trade one of the five best players walking the face of the earth — and they would only do so if Antetokounmpo demands it — they will want back a massive haul of first-round draft picks and promising young players, two things the Knicks do not have. One other thing that shouldn’t be a surprise out of those talks: Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson was “untouchable in these talks,” something Sam Amick reported at The Athletic . Not only is Brunson an All-NBA player on a favorable contract, but he is also a fan favorite and hero in New York. Trading him would anger the fan base, even if it was for Antetokounmpo. One of the financially cleanest trade options between the Knicks and Bucks is Brunson and Josh Hart for Antetokounmpo, those salaries come within about $300,000 of each other and work under the salary cap restrictions. It’s also a non-starter for both sides — the Knicks aren’t giving up Brunson, while the Bucks want picks and young players to jump-start a rebuild, not veterans. Any eventual Knicks offer likely involves Karl-Anthony Towns and a player such as OG Anunoby or Mikal Bridges (who can’t be traded until Feb. 1 and has a massive new contract kicking in). A mid-season trade of Antetokounmpo and his $54.1 million salary — to the Knicks or any team — is highly unlikely. Things get interesting if Antetokounmpo says he does not intend to sign the four-year, $260 million extension the Bucks can offer next offseason. If that happens, there would be a massive line of teams that would want in on an Antetokounmpo deal and many of them — Houston, San Antonio, Chicago and others — have the young players and picks Milwaukee would be seeking in a deal. Likely the only way Antetokounmpo ends up in New York is if he forces his way there, telling teams he will only sign an extension with the Knicks, and if these other teams trade for him, he will be a rental. Even then, like Toronto did with Kawhi Leonard in 2018, those teams still may be willing to take the gamble. For now, everyone wants to see how this season plays out. The Knicks rightfully see themselves as a team that can come out of the East. The Bucks want to see what Antetokounmpo and Myles Turner look like together. Houston with Kevin Durant, San Antonio with its young backcourt, and just about every other team wants to see how things look before making a massive move like trading for Antetokounmpo. Which is why it’s likely there is no action until next offseason. That’s not going to stop the chatter and rumors. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Strahinja Jokić, 43, pleaded guilty to trespassing and disorderly conduct after punching a Lakers fan in the face courtside at the Nuggets' Ball Arena. The trespassing charge is a misdemeanor, whereas the disorderly conduct charge is a petty offense. Strahinja Jokić was initially charged with third-degree assault after video of the punch made the rounds on social media.

Recovery from sciatica tends to take more than a couple of weeks.", "body": "While the Lakers just announced this week that LeBron James is suffering from sciatica and will be out for the first couple of weeks of the season — at least — it turns out he has been dealing with this for months. LeBron first started experiencing sciatica nerve pain in late July or early August during on-court workouts, reports Shams Charania of ESPN on NBA Today . Here is what he said: “My understanding is this injury for LeBron, this nerve issue, first developed, first occurred, in late July, early August, during an on-court workout. So it’s now two-and-a-half months and counting that he’s had to deal with it and manage it. So even before the Lakers’ Media Day on Sept. 29 and the start of training camp, I’m told LeBron James had not done much basketball for well over a month prior to that. So it had been a normal routine summer for him. He’s a creature of habit, we know that by the way he maintains his body. So for him to be out to start the season and miss his first-ever Opening Night, it shows an admission by him and the Lakers that he needs more time to ramp up, getting into basketball shape, getting into the right basketball conditioning that he’s accustomed to. He’s not there yet.” Because of the pain on his right side — the sciatic nerve runs from the tailbone down the leg to the feet — LeBron has been limited in his workouts, both physically and on the court. Once he’s pain free, it’s going to take time for him to get his conditioning up to speed and shake some of the rust off his game. All that can take longer at age 40. LeBron will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, but could well be out longer. For the Lakers, that puts more on Luka Doncic’s plate to start the season. It will also start to give GM Rob Pelinka and the Lakers front office a view of what Austin Reaves looks like as the No. 2 option next to Doncic. Reaves can be (and is expected to be) a free agent next summer, and the Lakers have to decide if he’s worth it to them to pay him $25-30 million a season and keep him around, or if they should look elsewhere. How this injury heals — and what’s causing the compression of the sciatic nerve, whether it’s muscular, a herniated disc, or something else — could also impact LeBron’s decision about how much longer he wants to play. LeBron is entering a record 23rd NBA season and will be a free agent next summer, giving him a lot of options for what the final year or years of his playing career could look like.

Before that, he spent two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers wearing No. 31, and earlier in his career bounced between 30, 31 and 10 as he moved from team to team. This NBA season is the first time since Seth entered the league as an undrafted rookie in 2013 that the two have shared a training camp, finally taking the floor as teammates instead of competitors. The 35-year-old joined the Warriors on an Exhibit 9 contract, which allows him to participate in training camp and the preseason. Because of the NBA’s second-apron restrictions, Golden State will need to waive him before finalizing its roster — but the team can re-sign him as early as Nov. 11 while staying under the tax threshold. The lighthearted jersey swap at open practice gave Warriors fans a glimpse of the brothers’ easy chemistry — and a reminder of how rare it is to see both Currys on the same court.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James , who is suffering from a case of sciatica. The current timetable is set for James to be reevaluated in 3-4 weeks. Needless to say, this is a huge loss for the Lakers, who run the risk of being without the future Hall of Famer for almost a month, which could significantly impact where the organization ends up this season. It's no surprise that James offers production in multiple areas. He's a top-tier playmaker and strong rebounder, and despite being 40 he can still be penciled in for 24-25 points per game. But the stats only tell you so much. There's also the element of him being a 6-foo-9, highly versatile and extremely physical floor presence, which are now features the Lakers will have to play without. James' ability to get to the foul line, as well as the threat of him in transition, will force the Lakers to slow things down, and likely by a considerable margin. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] That's a lot of easy scoring opportunities suddenly taken off the floor, not to mention a big, wide body, who is agile enough to defensively rotate between the perimeter and the interior. This isn't to say the Lakers are out of the playoff picture before the season even starts. But it does make any race later in the year difficult if they find themselves behind the curve when the calendar flips to 2026. With James out, the burden falls even more on the franchise's best player, Luka Dončić. The Slovenian lost weight over the course of summer, and has been getting early MVP buzz based on his play at EuroBasket, where he looked more engaged defensively and had better stamina. Dončić is known as someone who can put up big numbers, and as a player the offense can run through. This hasn't changed, and the Lakers are likely banking on the All-Star to carry an increased level of responsibility with James out. If the Lakers somehow get out to a strong start and find themselves within the top 6 in the time they're without James, that is going to be an enormous argument for the MVP chances of Dončić, who has yet to win one in his career. Of course, he'll have to get some help for the Lakers to find themselves in that position. That's where Austin Reaves, who will unquestionably get more on-ball opportunities without James, has a chance to shine. The 6-5 off-guard has always been reliable, but the Lakers are going to need him to approach legitimate All-Star production with James out. Can he do that, even though his play tends to overlap with that of Dončić? Or will head coach JJ Redick stagger them to a point where both Dončić and Reaves deliver when the other is on the bench? There's a lot to figure out in La La Land, but the Lakers have on-court options to help their chances with James out, and keep their head above water. Of course, it does need reminding that when James does return, it shouldn't come as a surprise if the Lakers dip a little in production. Installing a high-volume scorer, who is also a heavy on-ball creator, doesn't happen overnight, which is something the players and coaching staff will have to ready themselves for."}

[ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Amen Thompson – G/F, Houston Rockets: Amen flashed elite rebounding and defensive instincts last season, averaging roughly 1.15 fantasy points per minute. Playing alongside Kevin Durant should open up lanes for drives and assist opportunities. The lack of 3s and forgettable FT percentage are the only two knocks on an otherwise elite fantasy profile. No Fred VanVleet means Amen and Reed Sheppard will be running the show. Tyrese Maxey – G, Philadelphia 76ers: The undisputed No. 1 option in Philadelphia, Maxey’s efficiency and scoring volume make him a safe bet in all formats. His usage spike ensures multiple 40-plus-point fantasy nights, even with the health concerns surrounding the Sixers' roster. Jalen Green – G, Phoenix Suns: Green’s move to Phoenix gives him the green light to score at will. With Devin Booker drawing defensive gravity, he's always available and has a clean slate to fire away — the exact kind of highly explosive player you'll want for High Score. Kyshawn George - G/F, Washington Wizards: One of the more intriguing deep sleepers, George’s size and floor spacing give him multi-position upside. If he cracks the starting lineup, his length and shooting could push him into must-roster territory. Shaedon Sharpe – G, Portland Trail Blazers: With Anfernee Simons gone, Sharpe steps into a larger offensive role after averaging 27.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 10 games without him last year. Although he averaged under 1.0 FPPM in 2024-25 (0.93), he looks primed to anchor Portland's scoring alongside Deni Avdija. With high usage and expanding playmaking, Sharpe's a breakout bet who will eclipse the 30+ fantasy-point mark per game in High Score and points leagues. Isaiah Collier – G, Utah Jazz: Now Utah's starting point guard, Collier has averaged 6.3 assists and 0.9 steals per game through his first 71 games, solidifying his role as the team's primary facilitator. He's my prime late-round selection for High Score and he could finish top-10 in assists this season. Jaden Ivey – G, Detroit Pistons: Ivey's return from injury has reignited his breakout path. He averaged 17/4/4 last year and he'll be the secondary scoring and facilitating option alongside Cade Cunningham. His blend of pace, scoring and playmaking makes him a High Score steal outside the top 100. With increased usage and a 30-point floor when hot, Ivey's poised to deliver the breakout season Detroit's been waiting for. Paolo Banchero - F, Orlando Magic: The Magic finally have spacing, and that means more playmaking for Banchero. I'm in the minority, but I think we'll see the best version of Paolo yet. With Desmond Bane in town, expect upticks in assists and field-goal efficiency with fewer turnovers. I still prefer him in points over 9-cat leagues, but I'd still get him in 9-cat. Trey Murphy III, F, New Orleans Pelicans: Murphy is one of the league’s best breakout bets for 2025–26. When healthy last season, he averaged 0.98 fantasy points per minute. His combination of athleticism, 3-point volume, and efficiency gives him a real shot at making an All-Star-like leap — both in real life and fantasy. Deni Avdija – F, Portland Trail Blazers: Avdija’s game has always hinted at versatility, and in Portland, he’ll finally be unleashed. After the All-Star break last year, Avdija averaged 23-10-5. Handling the ball more and attacking mismatches, he’s a glue guy with the stat diversity to post strong all-around lines. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Bennedict Mathurin – G/F, Indiana Pacers: Mathurin’s aggressiveness is finally being matched with opportunity. He can get hot quickly, and as long as he locks in on defense, he'll be one of those boom players who's ideal for High Score. He'll also be solid for 9-cat leagues. Zion Williamson – F, New Orleans Pelicans: Zion enters 2025-26 in the best shape of his career, motivated by a contract fitness clause and New Orleans' push to compete before their 2026 pick goes to Atlanta. He averaged 1.56 FPPM in 30 games last year and remains one of the league's most efficient interior scorers, producing elite per-minute output. Since turnovers don't count and ceiling games are the north star in High Score, Zion's a top-15 lock whenever he's active. Brandon Miller – F, Charlotte Hornets: Before his wrist injury, Miller averaged 21.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists while commanding a larger offensive load. His 1.01 FPPM pace shows growth as a shot-creator and secondary playmaker next to LaMelo Ball. He profiles as a multi-category wing with top-60 upside across all formats, especially High Score. Tari Eason – F, Houston Rockets: Eason ranked in the 91st percentile in fantasy points per minute among frontcourt players. His energy translates directly into rebounds, steals and buckets. If his minutes climb, he’s one of the most efficient stat-stuffers available after Round 10. Jalen Duren – C, Detroit Pistons: Duren’s double-double consistency anchors Detroit’s frontcourt. He's in a contract year and has shown growth as a short-roll playmaker. He averaged an impressive 1.23 fantasy points per minute last season, and as his rim protection improves, that number should only climb in his fourth season. Santi Aldama – C, Memphis Grizzlies: Aldama remains under the radar but continues to produce whenever given minutes. His shooting and rebounding profile make him a sneaky floor-spacer who can hit double-digit points and boards in under 25 minutes. Aldama will play heavy minutes to start the year and is still being picked outside of the top 100 on Yahoo. Isaiah Hartenstein – C, Oklahoma City Thunder: Always a per-minute beast (~1.10 fantasy points per minute), Hartenstein is being undervalued in the market across formats. He does everything but shoot 3s and make free throws at a high clip. However, I love him as a sixth- or seventh-round pick if I don't nab bigs earlier in the draft. Kel’el Ware – C, Miami Heat: Nikola Jović's hype is building, but I'm still targeting more shares of Ware. He averaged over 1.0 fantasy points per minute last season and has so much potential as a rim runner. His ADP is falling because he came off the bench in the Heat's past two preseason games; I would buy the dip. Dereck Lively II – C, Dallas Mavericks: Daniel Gafford is already hurt and Lively's ADP is at a very affordable price at 116th overall. With 30 minutes a night potentially on the horizon, Dallas' primary defensive anchor is trending up after a season where he posted 1.19 FPPM. Although his usage is low, he's a cheap double-double big man with boom potential on the defensive end."}

The gym on this day belonged to Jimmy Butler III . “He just had an incredible practice,” coach Steve Kerr said. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “He wasn't on my team, so I didn't like to see it,” Stephen Curry said partly in jest. “But it was indicative of the ceiling that we can get to with a guy like that. A guy who at any moment knows how to win.” Even Butler’s faux nemesis, Buddy Hield , offered nothing but props to the man who turned 36 last month. “Jimmy dominated practice today,” Hield said. “It was great for him. He looked really good and professional today. It was great. Great energy.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Though general praise tends to flow freely in every training camp, the reaction in this instance is highly encouraging for the Warriors. There are many stories of Butler dominating scrimmages in his previous stops, whether Chicago or Minnesota or Philadelphia or Miami. Butler’s infamous scrimmage with the Timberwolves in 2018 is one that made its way around the NBA. Three weeks after asking to be traded, he led a group of reserves to victory over a squad that included four starters, with center Karl-Anthony Towns often the target of his ferocity. Butler was loud, hyperaggressive and, well, a winner. That last trait is welcome in Golden State. Though there was no indication hostility, seeing him bring juice to a scrimmage warms the heart of the team’s established veterans like Curry and Green. For doing so with the Warriors, who belong to Curry more than anyone, suggests Butler still is capable of being The Man. That while he embraces being “Robin” to Curry’s “Batman,” – the roles can be interchangeable upon request. “I just think he took it up a notch today,” Hield said. “He wasn’t chirping like that Jimmy we know of. He was a silent killer, and his work speaks himself.” There were shades of that Jimmy last season, as Butler occasionally took over portions of a game, usually when Curry was off the floor. He managed to make a significant impact despite being the new guy, tossed onto the roster during the searing heat of a playoff chase. “Last year, Jimmy didn’t know any defensive terminology,” Draymond Green said last week. “We were just making it work.” Butler this season is with the Warriors for a full training camp, which followed team workouts he arranged in the days before camp officially began. He’ll miss the third preseason game, Sunday against the Lakers in Los Angeles, for what Kerr called a “wonderful” personal matter, but he is scheduled to practice Saturday in LA before departing. This was, in a way, a reminder. Butler putting together a “Himmy Lives” display can only be beneficial for young Warriors to witness and veterans to realize his back pocket contains plenty of what they hope to see once the regular season begins on Oct. 21. “He was very impactful, across the board, getting to his spots, (flashing) his competitive will,” Curry said. “Our practices have been at pretty high level. Not every day, scrimmaging, but he kind of built up to a good session today. From the jump, Jimmy was attacking the rim, dictating the pace on both ends.” This is the Butler the Warriors need to threaten teams beyond Curry, and every occasion he shows up will be greeted with delight.

As we inch closer to the start of the NBA regular season, we’re getting an early look at players and teams. And while we should take what we see in preseason with a grain of salt, there’s some excitement building. Now would usually be the time to tell you who is on the verge of breaking out in 2025-26, but I find that limiting. When I watch the preseason I'm intrigued by what impact players — from rising stars to established veterans — can have on their teams if something I'm seeing can carry over to the regular season. That’s the joy of the preseason, seeing the payoff from offseason development and preseason experimentation. Here are a few names to keep an eye on at the start of the season. The intrigue with Wembanyama comes from wondering what approach he will take in Year 3. There is a balance that comes with offensive versatility. On one hand, a team can use a player in a lot of different scenarios — on ball, in the post, as a roller, off screens. That type of sandbox approach can keep consistent pressure on defenses, as there is not one specific thing to take away. On the other hand, a team can lose the emphasis on a specific action on a night-to-night basis. One thing has appeared clear from watching Wembanyama in preseason: a change in shot selection. For all of his size and skill, Wembanyama averaged nearly nine 3-point attempts a night last season. Through two preseason games so far, he has taken exactly two 3-pointers. There’s a clear emphasis for Wembanyama to increase his paint touches and work to catch the ball closer to the basket. More attempts to drive the basketball, and more attempts to initiate contact, should result in a better balance offensively. Working to seal matchups near the post or elbow is a way to keep pressure on defenses. His strength will be tested as teams continue to be physical with him on drives or fight to push his catches out. Can he get to his spots consistently? What does that look like when he does? Keep an eye on his playmaking this season. The Spurs have worked to use multiple players as screeners which could open up pops for shooters or rolls when they go double big. Wembanyama appears to be making more contact as a screener while mixing in slips and quick rolls — knowing when to roll and force the weakside to help, and knowing when to pop to force a rotation. A quick swing or a drive against a closeout could keep an advantage for the Spurs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] On the defensive end, Wembanyama is always a sight to behold. In pick-and-roll, he can be near the level of a screen, drop back to contain the drive, use his wingspan to swipe down at the ball-handler and still recover to his man popping or rolling. If the offense takes that space as a chance to pull up, that can easily turn into a switch and contest. His size jumps off the page when he is defending on the weakside, sometimes seeming like he can remove a quadrant off the court with his presence. The rim protection speaks for itself (176 blocks in 46 games last season, most in the league), but I'm intrigued by how he'll adjust as teams work to space him and play off his rotations. Murphy made a large leap last year prior to a shoulder injury, but I believe there is even more room for his game to expand. Never doubt the combination of knowing what you can do and working to improve on everything else. The quick decisions and reads continue to grow. When he’s spaced on the perimeter or running in transition, the threat is no longer just a 3-point shot but a drive. You can feel that impact when he’s used off the ball in dribble handoffs or pindowns. If you are not physical and give him space, or try to go under, the shot is going up. If you lock and trail, he can turn the corner and get to the paint or to his pull-up. If you try to get physical, you open up backdoor cuts or curls to the basket. The Pelicans will need that type of versatility in the half court which pairs well with Zion Williamson’s ability to be used in different ways. Murphy has also been looking to initiate contact to get to where he wants to vs. only taking the space given. An improved handle could open up more opportunities in pick-and-roll where he can reject and try to get downhill. Pitch-and-catch action could open even more room for him. It will be interesting to watch what it looks like if he has the mindset to create space in different areas of the floor. It's not difficult to think of the ways Horford’s experience can help a Warriors team that features Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green. But the speed in which you can see it already has surprised me to a degree. The defense is what jumps off the page. Horford's scheme versatility defending pick-and-roll will add a level of consistency to the Warriors' defense. His ability to get to the level of a screen, turn it into a trap, drop and contain penetration is key. We have seen time and time again no matter the age, Horford is willing to switch and defend multiple positions, and late switches can help the Warriors recover. The Warriors having Horford’s help defense on drives or rotations on the baseline is one thing. Having that with Draymond and Jimmy on the court feels like another. Offensively, Horford’s ability to space and willingness to move the ball fits right into the Warriors' ethos. The passing can open up cutters and keep an advantage for the Warriors when they get a defense in rotation. He can be involved in screening actions on and off the ball. How often have the Warriors had a big who can set a post split and receive a post split? Mike Brown has brought more ball movement, player movement and freedom to the New York Knicks offense. McBride looks like he fits right in to the vision and is set up to thrive within the offense. Simply put, it is wise to believe in a scoring guard within the confines of a Mike Brown offense (see Monk, Malik). More pace and more tempo should open up more opportunities for McBride to attack offensively. More opportunities in transition to attack an early clock suits McBride a little more than bringing the ball up (slowly) and going right into a set. An emphasis on spacing should also highlight McBride’s ability to get downhill to score. The ball moving from side to side should allow McBride to attack a tilted defense. Combine the offensive confidence with the effort he gives defensively and that unlocks even more lineup versatility for the Knicks. Do not be surprised by three-guard looks with McBride guarding a top option. The potential has always been there for Sharpe, but all of the elements appear to be coming together for a breakout season. One of the tougher things for a young, athletic player to navigate is understanding how and when to change speeds. Early in the preseason you can feel the growth from Sharpe in that area. There is more poise and composure, a combination of patience and confidence. We’re seeing a scorer play with an understanding of when and how to get to his spots against the space defenses are giving him. Sharpe is doing a better job of setting up his defender to get screened in pick-and-roll and, instead of hitting the turbo button to get downhill, he’s taking the space and attacking appropriately. The midrange pullup is there, but that attack can open up a kick, or a quick burst of speed can turn it into a drive. The more he can get downhill against closeouts, the tougher he becomes to guard. That kind of shiftiness can only open up things for him — and Portland — offensively. The sky is the limit if he is able to consistently mix the drives and self-creation. This is less about Cam Johnson the talent and more what Cam Johnson the talent unlocks for the Nuggets. It's the little things that can help them offensively. Running the wing in transition as Jamal Murray flows into pick-and-roll with Nikola Jokić. Seeing that action take place and diving from the wing to the block to take his man out of help defense. Forcing someone else to rotate which opens a kick from Jokić for 3. Running pick-and-roll with Jokić, kicking to the wing and immediately relocating for a 3. Backdoor cuts with a willing passer that put pressure on the defense. Those types of things have already stood out. The Rockets have added Kevin Durant to their roster, Alperen Şengün has gotten even better, Amen Thompson will get more responsibility in the Rockets' offense. I remain intrigued by what this season can look like for Smith. There is a clearer runway for him to have an impact on both ends of the floor, both with the starting lineup and mixing in with bench units. In the preseason we’ve seen a good mindset from Smith. Defensively, he has played with a high level of activity, switching and defending multiple positions. Defense is the base for the Rockets' success and the more he can grow on that end the better. Offensively, he’s continued to play with aggression, but it feels like it has more purpose behind it. If he gets a switch, he's trying to dive in the paint to get deep position. He's hitting first on his drives instead of solely relying on getting to a fadeaway. He's throwing the ball into the post and setting a post split to get involved in off-ball movement. It feels like his growth could be flying under the radar, but if he continues to hit the right notes that’s only good news for the Rockets. With both Tyrese Haliburton and T.J. McConnell out to start the season, it could be a moment for Nembhard to emerge. The Pacers will be different, but a lot of their principles will remain the same. Now is the time to see if Nembhard can build on the base he’s showcased the past few seasons. With Indiana's pace, tempo and movement, I do not think Nembhard will have to be the true “engine” of the Pacers offense. But there will be a lot more opportunities for him to impact the game offensively, and I want to see what that looks like. How much can he help the Pacers keep being the Pacers when it comes to pace/tempo? How does he handle being a larger part of a team’s game plan? Will the extra opportunities unlock a different level of aggression? We have seen the playoff production, the shotmaking, the defense, but this is a player who has yet to average more than 30 minutes a game in the regular season. The fit felt good when Cleveland traded for Hunter at the trade deadline; the team needed a wing who could defend multiple positions, knock down shots and drive the basketball. With a full offseason of familiarity in tow and some early injuries, is there room for Hunter to continue to grow? The shotmaking always feels important for Hunter’s overall impact, but this is a Cleveland offense that is built on pace and tempo. That can open a level of freedom which could allow Hunter to have more of an impact offensively. Does Cleveland work to get him the ball in different areas of the floor? Is there more room for him to drive or be involved in pick-and-roll? It feels like there is a real opportunity for Hunter to have an impact for the Cavs this year. Honestly, I am very excited to watch another year of Thompson being a mad man on defense. If you enjoy screen navigation, point-of-attack containment and overall activity, he will bring it to you every single night. But the athleticism and drives — and what that means for Detroit — is where the fun can begin on offense. Cade Cunningham runs the show, but Detroit values having shooting and playmaking on the floor. Can Thompson get consistent paint touches to force defenses to help and create advantages? Defenses may want to go under, but if he can turn the corner and become a pressure point, a lot opens up for Detroit. This one feels less like box-score growth and more like an opportunity for a player to really develop. New coach, new system and new opportunities abound in Memphis, and it’s clear they value what Wells brings to the table. There has been more of an effort to get him involved on and off the ball, and he’s shown an ability to space the floor. If he can continue to improve offensively, while being active on ball and pesky off ball defensively, Memphis could have a gem."}

It’s also a terrible predictive tool — don’t place your bets based on their responses ( might I recommend the clever folks at the NBC Sports betting page for your tips ). A year ago, 25 of the 30 GMs picked Boston to repeat (that was probably 26, Brad Stevens can’t vote for his own team), yet Oklahoma City won 68 games and the title — the GMs have picked the champion just once in the last seven years (the 2024 Celtics). So, is it a worrying sign for Oklahoma City that 24 of the 30 GMS picked them to repeat as champions? No, it’s more a sign of the conventional wisdom thinking around the league, which this survey certainly provides. Some highlights from the voting: NBA Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (80% of the vote). Cleveland and Denver were tied for second (7% each). East Champion: Cleveland Cavaliers (63% of voters had them first, 27% second), with the New York Knicks second (30% first-place votes, 53% second). West Champion: Oklahoma City Thunder (87% of voters had them first). Denver was second (10% had them first). Who will win MVP? Nikola Jokic, 67% of the vote. The next three in line were Luka Doncic (10%), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (8%), and Victor Wembanyama (7%). Who will win Rookie of the Year? Cooper Flagg, who got all but one vote (and Nico Harrison can’t vote for his own guy, so there was one vote for VJ Edgecombe). Flagg was also overwhelmingly voted the rookie that will be the best in this class five years from now (just know five years ago the GMs voted James Wiseman that honor). What player would you pick to start a franchise? Victor Wembanyama (83% of the vote, which makes you wonder what the other 17% are thinking). Player most likely to have a breakout season: Amen Thompson in Houston (30% of the vote). Brandon Miller (Charlotte), Ausar Thompson (Detroit) and Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio) were tied for second. Which team made the best overall moves this offseason? The Atlanta Hawks (53% of the vote). The second choice went to the Houston Rockets (27%). Which one player acquisition will make the biggest impact? Kevin Durant to Houston (73% of the vote). Desmond Bane to Orlando was second, and also voted the most underrated move of the offseason. Most surprising move of the offseason: Milwaukee waiving/stretching Damian Lillard (second on this list was the Bucks signing Myles Turner, which only happened because of the waive/stretch of Lillard). Who was the biggest steal in terms of where they were drafted? In a bit of a surprise, it went to Kasparas Jakucionis to Miami, selected at No. 20. Tied for second was Ace Bailey to Utah at No. 5 and Carter Bryant to San Antonio at No. 14. Best defender in the NBA: Victor Wembanyama with 80% of the vote. Dyson Daniels was voted the best perimeter defender in the league. Who is the best head coach in the NBA? Newly minted USA Basketball head coach Erik Spoelstra of Miami, with 52% of the vote (OKC’s Mark Daigneault was second, and the Clippers’ Tyronn Lue was third). Which team’s level of success this season is toughest to predict? The Philadelphia 76ers got 47% of the vote (Dallas and Golden State were second and third). With all due respect to the questions around the Mavs and Warriors, how do you not pick the Sixers? Which player is the most athletic? Amen Thompson got 58% of the vote to finish first (Anthony Edwards in Minnesota was second). Here’s one I questioned a little: The GMs voted Stephen Curry the best leader in the NBA. That surprised me. Not that Curry isn’t a strong leader, but would you put him ahead of Jalen Brunson, LeBron James, or even the injured Damian Lillard? One other interesting question and answer: What rule most needs to change? The No. 1 answer was concerns about roster construction, specifically that the tax apron rules are too harsh, and that there should be a salary cap discount for a team’s own drafted players.

He gave Steve Kerr’s club another avenue of attack, bringing low-turnover, high-efficiency isolation play and a steady diet of free throws to the party to serve as a perfect complement to Golden State’s tried-and-true Stephen Curry-centered motion offense. He diversified and strengthened the team's defense, pairing with Draymond Green to give the Dubs two high-IQ multipositional possession-wreckers capable of putting out fires all over the half-court. The impact was immediate, obvious and overwhelming: A .500 team with a negative point differential entering the trade deadline , Golden State posted the NBA’s fourth-best record , third-best net rating and No. 1 defense afterward.

In the 35 games in which Butler, Curry and Green all appeared, they went 27-8 — a 63 -win pace. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] They outlasted a young, hungry, physical and damn good Rockets team in Round 1, winning a Game 7 on the road despite Butler playing through a pelvic contusion and Curry dealing with a thumb injury , and took Game 1 of the conference semis on the road in Minnesota. It would prove a pyrrhic victory; as soon as Steph pulled up with a hamstring injury , Golden State’s fate was sealed. Even in defeat, though, its future path was clearly illuminated. The Curry-Green-Butler trio worked like gangbusters, and with the contracts of all three lined up for two more seasons (provided Green picks up his $27.7 million player option for 2026-27 ), the Warriors would try to maximize their potential of contending for a title right friggin’ now. “My headline is, this team heading into the season has got a great shot,” Dunleavy Jr. said on media day. So: In comes Al Horford , on the cusp of his 40th birthday, but still a supremely additive performer and hand-in-glove two-way fit with championship experience who, as Kerr put it, “fits any lineup, makes any lineup better.” (Big Al has already passed the first test facing any new arrival in the Bay: understanding that “the whole mindset is trying to make the game easier for [Steph].” Good start!) In comes Seth Curry , who shot 45.6% from 3-point range last season; who ranked in the 86th percentile in points per possession finished as a spot-up shooter and in the 96th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball-handler , according to Synergy; and who seems like a pretty good bet to slide smoothly into a system that his brother’s been running for, oh, 50 years. Back comes De'Anthony Melton , a two-way chaos agent who was a rotation piece during Golden State’s hot start last season before suffering a sprained left ACL and eventually being dealt to Brooklyn . Back comes Gary Payton II , a perpetually peculiar player who somehow manages to fit perfectly in Golden State, screening and diving and making the extra pass and guarding everyone with tenacity and alacrity. [ Get more Warriors news: Golden State team feed ] This, then, is the operating principle: Get as many smart players as possible — guys who understand how to cut, move, guard and pass, who understand how to play off of and maximize the three superstars — and see how it all shakes out. If, after a frostbite summer of sore feelings , the finally re-signed Jonathan Kuminga is willing to play a circumscribed role that fits into that framework , then that’s great news. And if he’s not … well, Jan. 15 will be here before you know it , and a two-year, $46.8 million deal could bring back pieces that more snugly fit the Warriors’ M.O. If everyone’s rowing in the same direction, and if the long-in-the-tooth centerpieces to whom Kerr, Dunleavy Jr. and the rest of Golden State’s braintrust have hitched their wagons can stay upright and operational, then we’ll have a chance to find out if what we saw after the trade deadline was just a small-sample-size magic trick, or if it’s sturdy enough to sustain over a longer haul. If it’s the former, then maybe we’ve already seen Steph’s last best chance at a winner. If it’s the latter, though, then we might be looking at a bona fide title contender. All the stuff I just said goes right! None of Steph, Draymond, Jimmy or Al miss extended periods, resulting in the Warriors finishing in the top 10 on both ends of the floor. GPII and Melton combine for something like a full season of havoc-wreaking, the supplemental youth — Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody, Gui Santos, young bigs Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post — gets in where it fits in around the aging tentpoles, and Dunleavy finds a Kuminga deal that bolsters the core. The Warriors finish with home-court advantage in Round 1 and, with a healthy Steph, a puncher’s chance against anybody they draw in the West. A roster carefully constructed around four of the NBA’s oldest players crumbles when those guys do what old guys do: get hurt and miss time. Golden State looks brilliant for stretches, but only for stretches, and none of that supplemental youth proves capable of shouldering a heavier load. No Kuminga deal materializes, and the bad taste of this summer lingers over an underwhelming season spent scuffling for a play-in berth and that ends before April’s out … and with Steph staring down his age-38 season, the end of the line looks to be approaching faster than anybody wants it to. Season opener : Oct. 21 at Los Angeles Lakers Complete schedule Start penciling in a couple of weeks of missed time here and there for their critical graybeards, and it’s not hard to see a world where they dip down below the mid-40s. If what we get is the version of the Warriors that ended last season plus Horford, though? Then Golden State should blow this number away.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record : 40-42 (eliminated in play-in tournament) Offensive rating : 113.7 (17th) Defensive rating : 114.8 (18th) Additions : Kristaps Porziņģis, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luke Kennard, Asa Newell Subtractions : Clint Capela, Larry Nance Jr., Georges Niang, Terance Mann Complete roster Trae Young is a four-time All-Star. He has averaged as many as 29.6 points and 11.6 assists per game. He has led his team as far as an Eastern Conference finals. And he is 27 years old — squarely in his prime. If ever there were a season for Young to take a step forward in his career — to move past the criticisms of his contributions as a winning player, especially on the defensive end — it would be this one. And if ever there were a team built to accentuate his game and mask his deficiencies, it would be this one. The Hawks added one-time All-Star center Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (among last year's Sixth Man of the Year candidates) to a roster that already boasted a talented rim protector and a cache of versatile wings. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Porziņģis will join Onyeka Okongwu in the frontcourt. Who will start is anyone's guess, but given Porziņģis' performance at EuroBasket over the summer, the guess here is that he will get the nod. Either way, Atlanta can field 48 minutes of quality rim protection behind Young, while Porziņģis also adds a layer of versatility on the offensive end. Young has never had a pick-and-pop option quite like Porziņģis. Nor has Young had this many versatile two-way wings to assist him on defense. In addition to Alexander-Walker, Atlanta features rising star Jalen Johnson, Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels and 2024 No. 1 overall draft pick Zaccharie Risacher. Luke Kennard and Asa Newell also joined the fray this season. The Hawks are deep and talented and built to support a ball-dominant superstar on his quest for a championship. The big question, then: Can Young be the best player on a serious title contender? We have our doubts, recognizing that doubts are what drive Young. He should also be driven by criticisms of his value as a teammate — levied by former NBA player Patrick Beverley over the summer. Young does have a tendency to make a game about himself, but he has also never had this much help. Do not forget about the matter of Young's contract, either. He owns a $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. He is eligible for a four-year, $229 million extension, which has not yet been offered. Is there a figure that satisfies both parties? It feels weird to go into a season in which the team has title aspirations (however long its shot might be) while the roster's best player is on a lame-duck contract. [ Get more Hawks news: Atlanta team feed ] Do the Hawks believe in Young as a driver of winning? That they must answer this season. And early. Because other teams will be asking themselves the same question, as they consider trading for Young. There are no good options if Young cannot lead this team into contention. What do the Hawks do, then? They can trade him, though they would have to find a team willing to give up real assets and pay Young. They could let him walk for nothing, freeing up cap space, though they have had no luck in big-name free agency. Or they could sign him to a fair extension, perpetuating a team with a sub-championship ceiling. It is so much better if Young is just awesome and embraces the brand of basketball that can coalesce a roster. Everything flows from there, because the Hawks would have their man, their team and real hope. Young is everything the Hawks imagined him to be, getting off the ball a little more on offense and digging deep on defense, and his effort on both ends sets a tone: The Hawks are here to compete. Johnson is an absolute star, maybe even an All-Star. They get a healthy season from Porziņģis. Risacher takes a step forward. Daniels is a menace. Everyone else is rock solid, and Atlanta has a real shot at winning the East. That's right. They could win this Eastern Conference. Whether or not they can beat whoever emerges from the West is another matter, but who cares, for Atlanta hasn't seen a Finals ... ever. Young is nothing the Hawks imagined him to be, prioritizing his own success over the team's. His business as usual on both ends stagnates the development of the young wings at his side — Johnson, Daniels and Risacher — and no amount of rim protection can guard against Young's carelessness on defense. Bad vibes permeate the locker room, and a trade is necessary, only Atlanta cannot find much more than nickels on the dollar. The Hawks take another step back in order to move forward behind a young core, which is not the worst of options, except that they'll need another point guard. And who is that guy? This is the catch-22: The Hawks may be damned to never win if they do keep Young and damned if they don't. Season opener : Oct. 22 vs. Toronto Complete schedule Trae Young is good. His supporting cast could be great. And what's the fun of rooting against a could-be contender? Take the over and hope Young is great, too. And he better be, because the team is built for it. East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

In a sit-down with NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke for \"Dubs Talk,\" the Golden State guard reflected on why the 2024-25 NBA season was the happiest of his basketball life and how coach Steve Kerr’s leadership played a central role. In his exit interview last season, Hield summed up his first Warriors campaign by saying, “This is the most happy I’ve ever been playing basketball.” With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Asked why Golden State has been different, Hield pointed to the trust and freedom he was given. “They allow me to be myself,\" Hield told Burke. \"They allow me to be me. Previous teams I’ve been on, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy, but here it’s just a unique vibe than the rest of the teams. They allow me to express myself, and I was able to to play basketball with a lot of joy and not have to look over my shoulder.” Before arriving in the Bay Area, Hield played for the New Orleans Pelicans, the Sacramento Kings, the Indiana Pacers and the Philadelphia 76ers, carving out a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable 3-point shooters.

Beyond the numbers, Hield described how the environment around him made the biggest difference. \"Everything was authentic from the coaches and the players, and it’s one situation where I just feel at peace,\" Hield added. That peace, Hield explained, stemmed from Kerr's leadership style . \"A lot of people say that coaches are transparent,\" Hield noted. \"A lot of coaches are not transparent. I think Steve was just 100 percent honest, transparent from day one, and never once has Steve given me the wrong answer. He’s always been straight up with me, and that’s what I like.\" The 60-year-old coach has built his Warriors tenure on communication and trust, winning four NBA championships while managing a locker room full of stars. Kerr, a former guard who played 15 NBA seasons and won five championships with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs, took over Golden State in 2014. Since then, he’s guided the Warriors through one of the league’s most successful runs. For Hield, that straight-shooting approach stood out immediately. \"As a basketball player, you love to be happy like that and love to play with that joy, and I couldn’t ask for a better year than that.\" With Kerr’s honesty and the Warriors’ support behind him, Hield enters Year 2 in Golden State not just chasing wins, but carrying the peace of mind that changed his game.

It is beyond cool that 40-year-old LeBron James , one of the greatest players in history, is on the same roster as Luka Dončić , one of the most decorated young players the NBA has ever seen. It is impossible not to think of their Lakers as a great team, if only because in our minds the two of them are that good. Whether they make practical sense as a championship duo is another matter. James is currently suffering from sciatica on his right side , which will cost him the start of the season. This is not news that inspires much confidence in James' ability to hold up his end of that bargain between two max-salaried co-stars. Meanwhile, Dončić is a 26-year-old who appears to be in the best shape of his life . One makes sense to build around. The other? He will be, at some point soon — if not now — just hoping the bottom doesn't fall out on his career. As difficult as it may be, the Lakers have to consider whether it is wise to spend any more of Dončić's prime investing in the chance that James could still be who Dončić needs him to be. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] Already, James is no longer the defensive stalwart he once was, not even close, and Dončić has never been known for his defense. Offensively, there is also a ton of overlap among their skill sets as ball-dominant superstars. There is reason for skepticism — reason to ask: Can they still maximize each other? They are, of course, also two of the greatest offensive minds the game has ever seen, and they will figure a lot of things out. They will win a lot of games, so long as James can get healthy, but can they win a title? The defense is a hindrance to that goal. Their third-best player, Austin Reaves, is no stopper. Nor is Deandre Ayton. The Lakers did sign one-time Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart, but at age 31 he has not displayed the same on-ball dynamism he once did. This is going to be a porous defensive team. They ranked 17th on that end last season and lost Dorian Finney-Smith, their best defensive player. Remember: Dončić and James took the floor together in the first round of last season's playoffs, losing in five games as favorites to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Los Angles did little to address its fatal flaw. [ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] The Dallas Mavericks built a team of two-way talents around Dončić and Kyrie Irving to reach the 2024 NBA Finals. The Lakers will eventually have do the same around Dončić in L.A., but they have not done that. Reaves and Ayton have a lot of potential between them, but little of it is on the defensive end. In Dončić's case, there is time to fix this. He is entering his prime and signed a three-year, $160.8 million contract extension. James does not have any of those luxuries. He will turn 41 years old in December, his contract expires at the end of this season, and we have no idea when Father Time will come for James. If, indeed, it becomes clear that this roster is not one with which Dončić can win a championship, what do the Lakers do? Do they try to reconfigure it around Dončić and James on the fly in the narrow window that they have together, dealing a 27-year-old Reaves and draft picks in search of two-way contributors? That has a real possibility of backfiring. Make moves in desperation, and the Lakers could easily find themselves in a post-LeBron era without any flexibility on the trade market, trying to field a competitive team around Dončić. Take a step back, and the plan becomes much clearer: Focus on Dončić — now. Build around him the way you would around a young James, and you know what a young James would do? Trade the 40-year-old aging superstar whose $52.6 million salary is a deterrent to building a title team around its best player. That, or let him walk in free agency at season's end, freeing up the kind of salary-cap space that could be committed to a more age-appropriate playing partner in Los Angeles. This is L.A., after all, and these are the Lakers. Someone will want to join Dončić on this ride. It is unclear if James even wants to be that guy, as his agent, Rich Paul, issued the following cryptic statement this past June: \"We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage of his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.\" What is best for James may not be what is best for Dončić, and the Lakers will soon have to choose sides. What that looks like in the short-term is anyone's guess, but one of their superstars is just beginning his L.A. story, while the other is scripting its end. Threading the needle between them may be a fool's errand."}

After going with a small-ball approach in the preseason opener while bringing Al Horford off the bench in his Golden State debut, Kerr made Horford a starter against the Trail Blazers along with Stephen Curry , Moses Moody , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . âThat could be a really powerful combo,â Kerr said. âI didnât have a great sense of it after the game because I was thinking so much of our turnovers and our lack of focus at times during the first half. But looking at the tape, it was a lot better than I expected for those first seven minutes or so.â Kerr likes having more size on the court to start the game, especially with Horford, who shoots well enough from three-point range to give everyone else plenty of room to operate. The group only played together for a little more than half of the first quarter before Kerr began making substitutions, and the veterans rested in the second half. âYou can tell with all the different lineups, we know that thereâs still going to be a lot to work on in terms of the chemistry and just the certain combinations,â Curry said. âThatâs part of the journey of training camp. But I just like the vibe and the intentionality that weâre all coming with, understanding that we need to get off to a good start. And trying to make that happen.â There’s more on the Warriors: Interesting. So yes, I think the starting lineup should be Curry Moody Butler Green Horford. Sounds like when things are right thatâs the best starting 5. Perhaps this has been suggested the last month or so? I donât know.., maybe? ari, easymoneyrider, peter contrope, nba is ok, davey j ..,? You gentlemen certainly have an opinion here? Moody canât start. He has no handle lol â¦.. Donât think heâd get much chances to handle anyways with Green facilitating a lot of the offence, Curry the go to guy and then Butler as your secondary scoring option and what third ball handler? It would be more of a catch and shoot role and be good defensively Kerr is the best coach in the league and will figure it out. Maybe Kuminga will play more if he actually gives it full effort.

Coach JJ Redick announced the plan on Saturday, but he didn’t specify when Doncic will be active and said it hasn’t been determined if he’ll suit up for Sunday’s matchup with Golden State. L.A. will also face Phoenix on Tuesday, Dallas on Wednesday and Sacramento on Friday. Doncic has been given a reduced workload in practice to allow him to recover from an intense summer representing Slovenia at EuroBasket. He was a full participant during Saturday’s session. “I had (the) national team,” Doncic said. “Playing one month or something of basketball (for Slovenia). Obviously it’s a long season ahead, so just because of that.” The Lakers dropped their first two preseason contests while using a modified lineup because Doncic and LeBron James were unavailable. There’s more from Los Angeles: James sitting out will be a great opportunity for Rui, Vando and LaRavia getting more minutes and more shots. Even Knecht might get some playing time with LeBron out. Hopefully, Bron comes back healthy in a month or two, and the Nove mentioned players will have built up some confidence, which will bode well for the Lakers in the playoffs. What team does better next season, GSW or Lakers? Both are old and seemingly on their last legs on being considered contenders but both donât exactly have strong enough rosters in comparison to some of the other teams in the league. Luka Bron Reaves with help from Smart Vando Rui Ayton or Curry Butler Green with help from Kuminga Heild Horford and what not They both finish with win totals in the high forties and their playoff fates will be hugely health reliant. If either one makes it out of the West it will be because they stayed healthy while other teams suffered key injuries. I wonât be shocked if Curry or LeBron add to their ring totals this yearâ¦and in that coin toss I will pick the Warriors I donât see either team having a chance at winning a chip unless there is a trade or two. Warriors could do that with Kuminga but until that happens then I donât rate their chances. As for the Lakers, I think they have many issues, mainly a lack of defence. Luka Reaves Bron and Ayton donât offer much and when you then have Smart and Vando in there for their defence they offer nothing on offence. They need more two way guys and better cohesion. Rui gets a lot of smack from people but he plays his role perfectly. Over 50% from the field and over 40% on 3, does well on defence and can play either forward spot. “Both are old and seemingly on their last legs of being considered contenders” GSW are old. LAL are not. Other than LeBron, they have only 2 players older than 30 – Smart and Kleber. In a potential Doncic, Reaves, Hachimura, Ayton, Vanderbilt line-up, the oldest player is 27. That line-up has the same average age as Strus, Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, Mobley, Garland team. Carmelo, Russ, Dwight, Rondo, Ariza, DeAndre Jordan are not in Los Angeles anymore. That team was old in 2022. 25-26 Lakers are not. Not a good sign to load manage Luka already. Maybe an injury prone player shouldn’t beat himself up just weeks before the NBA season.

A $10MM annual salary with a club option in 2026/27 made Ball extremely attractive to contenders, and the Cavaliers were the first to pounce, sending Isaac Okoro to Chicago in a July trade . Ball is happy to be with a contender in Cleveland, and he believes both teams benefitted from the deal. âI think teams trade to try to get better, so Chicago did what was best for them, and I think Cleveland did what they thought was best for them,â Ball said. âSo all I can control is where Iâm at and who Iâm playing for, and thatâs the Cavs right now. Go out there and give them my all.â Ball completed a remarkable comeback last season, appearing in 35 games after missing two and a half years due to recurring knee issues. Cowley expects the Cavs to be cautious with him — limiting his minutes and not using him on both nights of back-to-backs — in order to keep him healthy for the playoffs. Ball is still a beloved figure in Chicago, and he received a tribute video when Cleveland visited the United Center on Thursday. âJust thankful, man,â he said. âI made a lot of good relationships here on and off the court. Loved the city of Chicago, and, as you can see, the fans still rock with me, so a lot of love to them. But coaches, man, even my teammates, itâs always great seeing them and hope the best for them moving forward, for sure.â There’s more on the Bulls: 24 wins at best. I think you are waaaaay underestimating there…Tre Jones is underrated. Coby White and Vucevic are in contract years, and Giddey was really good down the stretch in important games. I’d start those 4 with Okoro, Dosunmu, and maybe eventually Buzelis, and that’s a good lineup. Lots of playmaking and shooting, albeit with a lack of rim protection, but I’d put them in the 42-45 win area because Donovan is also a great coach. Nice to see that Pat got his running practice in in the dunes. Since thatâs all he does on the court too. Just run back and forth and move the ball . TSnell 2.0 Imagine waiting for a positive impact from P-Will after wasting the first 5 YEARS of his careerâ¦and he was even given $90 mil to stay here! Another failure from the AKME era of the Bulls. Shouldâve gotten rid of him a couple years ago when we knew he wasnât worth the #4 pick. Williams is getting in shape to more quickly run to the bank to cash those huge checks before he’s run out of the league. Please login to leave a reply.

In a pre-game meeting with reporters, coach Jason Kidd said the team is taking a cautious approach with Exum’s recovery. He indicated that Exum will be out for an extended period, but didn’t speculate on how long it might be. This is the first time anyone from the team has provided specifics on the injury that has affected Exum since training camp began. Kidd added that the Mavs are taking a “long-term view” with Exum’s health and explained that the injury has “delayed his preparation for the start of the season,” tweets Grant Afseth of Dallas Hoops Journal. Injuries have been a career-long issue for Exum, who only appeared in 20 games last season due to right wrist surgery and a broken left hand. He was still an effective player when healthy, making 13 starts and averaging 8.7 points and 2.8 assists in 18.6 minutes per night. Exum reached an agreement in early July to re-sign with the team on a one-year, minimum-salary contract. The deal wasn’t finalized until September 1 because Dallas had to open a roster spot and clear up room under its second apron hard cap. That happened when the Mavs waived and stretched former first-round pick Olivier-Maxence Prosper in late August. Dallas had been hoping for better health from the 30-year-old combo guard, as Kyrie Irving is still recovering from a torn ACL and his return date remains uncertain. In addition,Â Brandon Williams is dealing with a hamstring strain he suffered early in training camp. If Exum’s absence appears to be prolonged, it could improve the chances for Dalano Banton ( Exhibit 10 contract ) or Dennis Smith Jr. ( Exhibit 9 deal ) to earn a roster spot. I’m glad Dallas has given Exum a chance, but it does not seem likely he is going to be able to sustain an NBA career. So on point. I love the comeback story, but seriously what is Dallas doing giving out guaranteed money to Exum, injury is certain to follow Please login to leave a reply.

Wright of ESPN . The No. 2 pick in this year’s draft sat out the first two games as a precaution after undergoing thumb surgery in September, and he enjoyed the chance to showcase his skills in a game setting. “Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,” Harper said. “My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they’re going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they’re here to help me out and I’m here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.” Harper checked into the game midway through the first quarter and picked up two quick assists on alley-oop passes to Victor Wembanyama and Luke Kornet , per Jeff McDonald of The San Antonio Express-News (subscription required). He only played 18 minutes due to a medical restriction, but he ran the offense while he was on the court and finished with a game-high plus-minus rating of +20. He also picked up full-court on defense and vowed that part of his game will get better as his conditioning improves. “It’s just another step for him and his young career as he’s going to continue to grow,” coach Mitch Johnson said. “Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he’ll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.” There’s more from the Southwest Division: Jones-Garcia can play. Unfortunately the Spurs have a lot of guys his size or taller with more experience, so unless they have some injuries he’ll be stuck in the G league.

Boucher, who spent the past seven years in Toronto before signing with Boston as a free agent in August, posted 19 points and nine rebounds in 23 minutes against his former team. He made his second straight start at power forward and may keep that role when the season begins. âHe cares about winning, he cares about people, he takes pride in his work ethic,â coach Joe Mazzulla said. âThereâs few guys who take no plays off whether itâs at shootaround, or a game, and that guy is one of them. Itâs impressive, 32 years old, to have the energy that he does on and off the court.â Boucher, who accepted a one-year, veteran’s minimum contract, has been a welcome addition for a team that had significant front court losses from last season. Robb sees him as a natural fit for the up-tempo approach that Mazzulla wants to bring to the offense, and he’s willing to shoot from beyond the arc whenever he gets an open look. Boucher is probably most effective in a double-big lineup, Robb adds, but he can handle some minutes at center if the Celtics want to go smaller. “I’m really excited,” Boucher told the Toronto media, including Josh Lewenberg of TSN Sports about his decision to sign with Boston ( Twitter link ). “I talked to them and had a great conversation about what my role could be and the opportunity I could get on this team. So, for me, it was an easy decision to make.” There’s more on the Celtics: Baylor Scheierman is still a learning process… Well he’s 25, hope he gets it sooner rather than later He’s a year younger than Xavier Tillman, which is wild cuz Tillman looks a tad like my grampy What mazzulla angry about?

One scout questioned whether Sarr will become a reliable enough outside shooter to qualify as a stretch big man, while another suggested the seven-footer will have to bulk up and become more imposing physically in order to maximize his potential as a rim protector. “He weighs less than some of the bigger wings and forwards that are starting in the NBA,” that scout said. Still, multiple sources who talked to Robbins are optimistic about Sarr’s ability to build on what he showed during his rookie season and to continue making strides toward becoming a reliable starting center. “I would be surprised if he doesnât take a big leap this year, and that big leap will be being effective on the floor and trying to impact the team outcome as opposed to impacting his individual outcome,” one evaluator told Robbins. “Thereâs still a lot (of untapped potential) as to what he could be. It was probably a slower start than maybe the general fan would hope for. But I think by the end of (last) season, he had been put in a position to succeed, and weâre going to see more of that built on this season. Weâre going to see it start to pay dividends this season.” Here’s more on Sarr and the Wizards: I was not happy with what I saw from Sarr in his rookie year. Not because he was bricking jumpers or because he didn’t have polished finishing moves around the rim, but because he displayed abysmal positioning in every stage of the play on both ends: in the paint when his team had the ball, under the basket, when sets didn’t go right etc. That’s why he mostly defaulted to dangling around the perimeter – he didn’t know where to put himself, so he floated outside. On defense, it was the same thing. Don’t let his occasional blocks fool you – he was a huge negative when the opponents had the ball, couldn’t defend the rim and let all sorts of things happen in his paint. It was amazing to see how little space he occupied and protected while being a 7-footer. The only thing he did well was switching onto perimeter players and doing a good job of containing them. I’ll give him that. This incompetence at positioning is a basketball crime to me, especially for someone who was born in a basketball family and attended Real Madrid’s academy. It’s the reason why he can’t grab rebounds at his height. I was in Katowice to watch him at Eurobasket, and it was even more evident in person, because you can concentrate on 1 player and what he does when you’re in the stands. I’ve given up on Alex Sarr. It’s sort of reverse psychology: if I don’t expect anything from him, so that he can’t disappoint me. If he develops into something, it’ll be a pleasant bonus. Can Vukcevic be a real 5, or is he a bench stretch 4? Probably the latter, but we’ll see. Washington’s plan to somehow draft Bailey after the brutal lottery didn’t work out. Utah took him. So, Tre Johnson it is. Well, at least the team didn’t pick Knueppel or Fears at 6. Hopefully, one of Tre Johnson or Whitmore can score, and the team won’t be down by 15-25 points in the 1st half like they so often were in 24-25. And the games will be closer. What will happen to CJ? Most likely, the same thing that happened to Brogdon: nobody will trade for him before the deadline (because his value is being better than a bad contract, and there aren’t that many bad contracts in the NBA anymore), he will spend the entire season with the Wiz, and will get a veteran minimum in the summer of 26. Jamir Watkins is whatever. This team will be tanking for way too long and will have way too many picks needing minutes for him to get an opportunity. Please login to leave a reply.

So, you can predict what kind of strategy we will use for this season. But we have a very young team.” Tsai isn’t saying anything that any Nets or NBA fan doesn’t already know. Brooklyn entered the summer as the only team with significant cap space, but used that room to take on unwanted contracts and continue stockpiling draft picks rather than acquiring win-now help. With five rookie first-round picks on their roster, the Nets will be prioritizing player development over their win-loss record in the coming months. Although Brooklyn’s approach to the season is no secret, the NBA typically frowns upon any public remarks from an executive or owner suggesting that his team might be in tanking mode. Tsai’s comment about being able to predict the “kind of strategy” the Nets will use to achieve their goal of getting a “good” draft pick can certainly be interpreted that way, so we’ll see if the league office responds at all, perhaps with a fine. After the Nets won 32 games in 2023/24 and 26 in ’24/25, oddsmakers have set their over/under for ’25/26 at just 20.5 wins. While general manager Sean Marks has insisted he was happy the team exceeded preseason expectations last season, his moves since last December – including trading away veterans Dennis SchrÃ¶der , Dorian Finney-Smith , and Cameron Johnson – suggest he wouldn’t mind if the Nets were to drop a few more games this year and land a pick higher than No. 8 in the 2026 draft lottery. In the process of reducing the number of veterans on the roster, Marks has loaded up youth, selecting Egor Demin (No. 8), Nolan Traore (No. 19), Drake Powell (No. 22), Ben Saraf (No. 26), and Danny Wolf (No. 27) in this June’s draft. Brooklyn projects to have the NBA’s youngest team in 2025/26, as Lewis notes. What an exquisite way to say they’re tanking. Hope he gets fined hard. Well, given he is worth billions even $5 million fine would mean nothing more than pocket change to him. 2026 draft is loaded So they don’t think MPJ can lead them to a play in 8th seed? He can’t do it alone, and he’s not on their future plans anyway. MPJ, Claxton, Thomas all when healthy can be a play in team. They are one of the youngest teams so will probably be bad like Wiz. They should be a fast pace team, but Claxton the only defense guy I think of on the team. He will be dumped at some point this season I don’t know $38-40 million is a lot for him. It is a good price for Nets I guess as their best player. It would be terrible on other teams like Nuggets when the guy is 3rd option. Openly admitting before the season has even started, that they are actively trying to lose, is a whole new level of arrogance. How is it arrogant when the team IS so young and likely to lose a lot of games anyway? I don’t know why people take issue with the person saying the obvious thing we all know will happen anyway. It makes zero difference. The league punishes it only because they don’t like the quiet part being said out loud, which is frankly a little silly since even casual fans know how much of a problem tanking has become. But until they further flatten out the lottery odds it will continue to happen. That’s on the league. BKN played too well last year, and it cost them in the draft. I guess the owner is sending a message to his FO and HC that he wants no part of that again. Sad, though, that tanking has gotten to the point that an owner feels totally comfortable being so open about it. It’s what happens, I guess, when a league doesn’t have a real commissioner. Teams certainly tanked under Stern, but not so shamelessly. Not only did they deny it, they took enough acts to back up those denials. It was a source of shame, and all assumed that if Stern had real evidence of a team not using its best efforts to win (required by the articles of association), that such team would be punished. Now, not only are teams out of the closet, but they boast about their efforts in doing it. They would never attach a pick to get rid of his contract… His contract has some value. His salary is really big, so only way they trade him is by taking on a worse contract (e.g. Paul George). Big chance fhey keep him, try to increase his value and trade him as an expiring contract next off season… Please login to leave a reply.

Despite the lengthy negotiations and a contract that could make him a prime trade candidate, Kuminga tells Marc J. Spears of Andscape he’s “at peace” with his situation and doesn’t feel any anxiety about the future. “ I donât think about things like that. I let the day just tell us whatâs going to happen ,” Kuminga said. “ But when it comes to future stuff and things like that, no. I donât worry about things like that. I just try to get better. You never know with this life. Itâs the NBA. One day youâre going to be here. One day youâre going to be somewhere else. “ The biggest thing about it is just to work and just get better every day and be a winner. No matter where Iâll be, no matter if Iâm going to be here or they might ship me somewhere else. I just want to get to wherever Iâll get, or be here and just be involved and win and impact right away. That is my biggest concern. Iâm at that point now where Iâve got a couple years in now. So, I know whatâs right and what is not right .” Kuminga acknowledged some frustration with the way his role has fluctuated during his time with Golden State and said he doesn’t plan to bring the topic up with head coach Steve Kerr . For his part, Kerr still believes Kuminga can be an important piece for the Warriors, according to Spears. “ Itâs been an interesting fit ,” Kerr told Andscape. “ Heâs made it pretty clear that he wants the ball and an opportunity that a lot of his cohorts get and people that were drafted near him. And we werenât able to offer that. We were a championship team. We won the title his rookie year (2021/22) and have been in the mix the last few years. So, itâs been tough. I respect the fact that he is competing and fighting in a set of circumstances that maybe isnât ideal for him. But the thing I keep telling him is he can play a role for us, absolutely, with his size, speed and athleticism. “ He can play an important role on a very good team. He just turned 23 (on Monday). He has plenty of basketball ahead. One day, hopefully, he will look back on this as a valuable time in his career. But I know heâs frustrated. Heâs made it very clear publicly. I donât mind that, but I want him to embrace the idea that he can be a part of something special .” Here’s more on the Warriors: Wow there aren’t 100 comments rehashing the same argument over and over yet. Teams like the Dubs are just boring. If the ancient Ford pickups with 250k miles on them keep running for most of the season, theyâll be a pretty good team. If not, theyâll be bad. So what. Moving on. Not sure what sort of basketball you like to watch but the Warriors’ style of play isn’t boring to me. I prefer the motion offense that they employ (and most teams have started to mimic/adopt portions of in their play). Nothing in basketball is better than Steph on a heater, and then he does some dumb funny s*** like the night night and it gets even better! Give it time, it won’t be long. There definitely werenât enough Dubs talking points this summer, justkidding. The usual cast of characters bantered and pondered more about Kuminga than the guy deserves. I was hoping he would get moved this summer. Dunleavy could REALLY wash his hands clean of the Meyers Era by packaging JK along with Moody and potentially even Draymond for a superstar/superstar-caliber player Steph desperately needs to seriously compete for chip #5. Iâm curious to see how the current group does – but since this roster is so damn deep now, it feels like a big trade at some point in the next 9 or so months is inevitable. Yeah ,,,,,, I wondered about that. Imo he will be traded as soon as they can. He doesnât fit this team now. Warriors need a proven guy. Not nurture a new talent.? They will move him. “I just want to get to wherever Iâll get” That pretty much says it all. I was very disappointed in Kuminga the last few days. His 2nd preseason game he was not focused at all and made some very poor mistakes. Then at the fan open practice he sat on the bench and didnât do anything. No shooting or fan interaction. Itâs almost like he wants to force a trade in Jan. I think itâs the worst kept secret that both sides are just waiting for a January trade Looks like Kuminga wants out as soon as possible maybe with kings out of the playoffs they can get Murray and some bench players for Kuminga. But certainly youâve read assessments here that heâs a future canât miss all nba bonafide pro who has been ruined by his coach and lack of opportunity? Donât drink the kool-aid from people hereâ¦ if someone can consistently put up 20 points a night and play defense with effort, every NBA coach will consistently find minutes for him instead of splitting time with Gui Santos and Gary Payton Jr. Maybe the veteran players on GSW arenât especially good at translating their knowledge for younger players to absorb. Certainly GSW hasnât developed their talent very well despite some very lucky breaks from the lottery. Probably some combination of all 3 of Kuminga, the veterans and the coach share the blame. Either way, if it walks like a duckâ¦ you know the rest. The Warriors didnât think he was worth much, the Kings thought he was worth Malik Monk and Devin Carter, and his own coach refuses to play him in the playoffs with minutes available and scoring desperately needed. At some point acknowledging the external and consistent ongoing indicators of Kumingaâs value will be accurately reflected in discussions here. But until then youâll have to hear people say heâs the backbone of a Giannis trade. Iâm sure the Kings offered the Bucks Malik Monk and Devin Carter for Giannis as well. Warriors couldnât make that trade because Monk makes more than Kuminga. Carter is not even loved by the kings. Nobody offered anything for Kuminga and he is not a 20 point a game player. @ARC 2 I think he’s definitely a 20 ppg player, as long as a team makes him a starter and plays him at least 32 min/gm. His career per 36 pts is 20.5, and that’s with Kerr jerking him around and benching him frequently. He proved that in the Wolves series in the playoffs, despite Kerr not starting him even once and playing him only an avg of 27.4 min/gm, he still avgd 20.8 ppg on 545/42%/74% splits. Itâs not so much th points but no IQ plays. He threw the ball away on 2 different possessions on a simple throw in that cost them 4 points. He needs to have his head in the game on every possession. Draymond has done the same thing multiple times. @Duuur Except obviously the Kings thought Kuminga was worth more than Monk and Carter, but GSW wasn’t desperate enough to trade Kuminga + another player to do the deal. “The Warriors didnât think he was worth much” They think he’s worth a good young player and a FRP, which is why they offered multiple overpays for him to choose from. He signed a tradable 1+1, so we will see what they get for him by the deadline. @ARC 2 “Itâs almost like he wants to force a trade in Jan.” Almost? Relax bro. Even if he leaves. You will get good value for him. Love to see him with Grizz or Bucks. Podz thinking of himself as a leader is interesting. you can’t play his position and not be a leader. He wants to stay with GS for as long as possible. Wants to be there post-Steph. Tries so hard to be a company man for them. Attends their women’s team games, always says the right things in interviews. He wants to make himself more valuable for GS than for any other team in the NBA. Sort of like Draymond. But Draymond is a much better player than Podziemski is or ever will be, of course. Why do you comment on things when you don’t know what they said. Heâs literally quoted in the article saying that. Reading is fundamental He didn’t say he is a leader. He said the next step in his development is to evolve emotionally as a player and leader.

The Magic selected four of those players in the first round of the past three drafts, with Bitadze being the lone exception. Here are a few more notes from around the Southeast Division: Carter and Bitadze are an impressive center duo. Bitadze’s defense is phenomenal. Good luck, Precious, however you’re dead to me like IHART. Magic should be very good this year. I feel people are low-key sleeping on Orlando and Atlanta. Both could be very dangerous.

Why the Warriors could be more dangerous than you think", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46545448/nba-season-2025-2026-golden-state-warriors-western-conference-champions-oklahoma-city-thunder", "published_at": "2025-10-13T07:20:01+00:00", "domain": "espn.com", "summary": "ESPN analyst Zach Kram details why Golden State's championship window might not be closed after all.", "body": "Stephen Curry tells ABC's Larry Beil that he isn't worried about the age of the Warriors' roster. (1:01) A decade after winning the first of four titles to start a dynasty, the Golden State Warriors have seemingly been passed by the rest of the Western Conference. According to ESPN BET , the Warriors have just the seventh-best odds to win the West this season, behind the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder , Denver Nuggets , Houston Rockets , Los Angeles Lakers , Minnesota Timberwolves and LA Clippers . That placement makes some sense. Golden State was the No. 7 seed last season, bowed out in five games in the second round and could boast the oldest starting lineup in NBA history this season. If Buddy Hield joins Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler III , Draymond Green and Al Horford in the starting lineup after Hield's birthday on Dec. 17, the Warriors would be the first team to start five players 33 or older in a game, according to ESPN Research. But that quick, pessimistic summary severely underrates Golden State's potential. In contrast, the Warriors profile as one of the most dangerous teams in the West, even in their dotage, and they might even be able to compete with the omnipotent Thunder. The NBA's last repeat champion could be a sleeper that stops the newest candidate from repeating. Projections from ESPN's Kevin Pelton place the Warriors second in the entire NBA, with a forecast of 56 wins -- closer to the top of the West than to the play-in portion of the standings. What explains the discrepancy between that projection and the general perception that the Warriors' window has closed? Here's the simple explanation: In half a season with Butler, the Warriors were one of the best teams in the league, and they improved in the offseason. By that logic, they should be a contender again this season. Golden State upset the second-seeded Rockets in the first round and took Game 1 against the Timberwolves before running out of steam without Curry, who suffered a hamstring strain 13 minutes into the series. There's no shame in losing that way, as any contender would expect to struggle without its best player. Don't let the 2024-25 Warriors' meek playoff exit mask their remarkable in-season turnaround, though. Before the Butler trade, Golden State was 25-26 with a minus-0.4 net rating. But from Butler's debut through the end of the regular season, it ranked first in defensive rating and third in net, at plus-9.2 per 100 possessions. The team's 23-8 record in that span -- which extrapolates to 61 wins over a full season -- wasn't a fluke. With Curry back and Butler on board for a full season, there's no reason to think Golden State will be any worse this season. The Warriors should benefit from incredible continuity. Twelve of their top 13 players in 2024-25 postseason minutes will return in 2025-26, and they upgraded on the one departure ( Kevon Looney ) with Horford, who left the Boston Celtics in free agency. Horford's arrival in Golden State is crucial , as Curry has never played with a big man like the 39-year-old NBA champion before. Among Warriors centers since Curry's breakout season (2012-13), the leaders in total 3-point makes are Dario Saric , who made 74 3s as a backup center in 2023-24, and Quinten Post , who sank 73 as a rookie last season. By comparison, Horford has made triple-digit 3s in each of the past three seasons, and his 40.9% 3-point mark over that span is the best among all centers with at least 100 makes, narrowly ahead of Karl-Anthony Towns' 40.8%. His ability to stretch the floor will provide important balance next to Butler and Green, who can both be reluctant shooters. Horford is also a far superior defender and creator to Saric and Post, making him a better all-around fit for the Warriors' lineup. There is tremendous defensive potential in a frontcourt featuring Butler, Green and Horford, who have a combined 15 All-Defensive Team appearances in their careers. A strong defense, after all, is just as central to the Warriors' winning identity as Curry's deep 3s. In 2021-22, their last title season, the Warriors finished second in defensive rating versus just 16th on offense. And last year, Golden State led the league in defensive rating after Butler's arrival -- even without Horford, and even with their opponents making an unsustainably high percentage of their 3-point tries. Golden State should also be better on the other end this season. In 2024-25, the offense hummed as long as Curry was on the floor but fell apart when he rested; lineups without Curry or Butler placed in just the 5th percentile in offensive rating, per Cleaning the Glass. Butler stabilized those groups, though, and the Warriors ended up looking solid as long as one of those stars was on the floor. Age and availability could get in the way of that plan. Curry has missed an average of 15 games per season since sitting out nearly all of 2019-20, while Butler hasn't reached the 65-game threshold for NBA awards since 2018-19. The Warriors will likely struggle once again when Curry goes to the bench in games that Butler misses. Jonathan Kuminga , who is still a Warrior for now after a protracted restricted free agency , could play an important role as the best scoring option in no-Curry, no-Butler minutes; he averaged 24.3 points on 55% shooting in the Warriors' final four playoff games last season. Or Kuminga could improve the team by helping to facilitate a midseason trade. Kuminga is the only Warriors player with a cap hit between $12 million and $25 million this season, meaning he'd provide the necessary matching salary to get Golden State another sizable deal at the deadline. For now, though, it's unclear at what position the Warriors would need to improve. As the season approaches, they're operating with an enviable combination of star power and depth. Five different Warriors -- Curry, Butler, Green, Horford and Brandin Podziemski -- rank among the top 10% most impactful players in the league on a per-possession basis, according to the advanced stat xRAPM, which blends play-by-play and on/off data. The only other teams with more than three such players are the Thunder, Rockets and Cleveland Cavaliers . And behind that quintet, the Warriors have a mishmash of role players on the perimeter -- Hield, Kuminga, Gary Payton II , Moses Moody , De'Anthony Melton -- with various strengths, plus Post and Trayce Jackson-Davis to offer different looks as bigs off the bench. As Pelton notes about his projections, the Warriors \"have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team.\" Ultimately, the Warriors' greatest problem might not be anything about their roster specifically, but rather the context around them: The top of the West is much better than it was in 2022, when Golden State beat the injury-ravaged Nuggets, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks en route to the Finals. But even with that change, there are still major concerns for every team in the conference behind Oklahoma City and Denver. Fred VanVleet 's ACL tear should lower Houston's ceiling, perhaps by a considerable amount. Minnesota is relying on a number of rapidly aging veterans (38-year-old Mike Conley and 33-year-old Rudy Gobert ) and unproven youngsters ( Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr .) to support Anthony Edwards . The Lakers have a thin rotation and a potentially disastrous defense, and they're already dealing with a LeBron James injury. The Clippers face the same age questions as the Warriors, plus the possible ramifications of the Kawhi Leonard /Aspiration investigation . Even the Thunder, who don't even have any minor concerns, let alone major ones, could struggle to dispatch Golden State in a potential playoff matchup. The Warriors have consistently played this version of the Thunder tough. Over the last two seasons, Golden State is 3-4 against Oklahoma City; two of those losses came in overtime, and Curry didn't play in the other two. Butler wasn't on the roster for any of those contests. The Warriors wouldn't ever be favored to knock off the Thunder, of course, and they would need to navigate a minefield -- one of talented competition and their own age hurdles -- to get the chance. But it's not an entirely unrealistic proposition, and at this stage in their competitive timeline, a chance is all the Warriors can ask for. With James Wiseman gone and Kuminga halfway out the door, the Warriors' \"two timelines\" plan has been scuttled. It's all about the present timeline now, and maximizing Curry's remaining opportunities to add to his trophy case."}

Murray will undergo surgery and be reevaluated in four to six weeks, ruling the Kings' young power forward out for at least the first 10 games of the regular season. The injury comes at a pivotal time in Murray's career. Entering his fourth season, he is eligible for a contract extension in the next week. The deadline to come to an agreement with the Kings is Oct. 20. If they can't, Murray will enter restricted free agency next summer. Murray has been a pillar of durability early in his NBA career, appearing in 233 of a possible 246 games his first three seasons, starting all but two of them. This UCL tear is the most significant injury he has suffered as a pro. Murray was the projected starting power forward for a Kings team attempting to compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. He has made 543 career 3s and developed into a versatile defender on the wing, meaning the Kings will be without a crucial floor spacer and their most trusted stopper in the opening month.

Dennis Schroder , Zach LaVine , DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis are the four other expected starters."}

(0:58) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- While LeBron James is expected to be sidelined to begin the season as he recovers from sciatica on the right side of his body, the Los Angeles Lakers ' other superstar, Luka Doncic , said he doesn't feel compelled to do more in James' absence. \"I don't view it that way,\" Doncic said after practice Saturday. \"I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.\" So far without James and Doncic, the Lakers are winless in the preseason, going 0-2 against Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors . L.A. hosts Golden State in a preseason rematch Sunday, and Lakers coach JJ Redick said it is still being determined if Doncic will play. Sunday starts a stretch of three preseason games in four days for the Lakers, continuing with a road game against Phoenix on Tuesday and the second night of a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Redick said Doncic would play in two of L.A.'s remaining four preseason games. Doncic was a full participant on Saturday after having his workload modified all week to save the 26-year-old guard some wear and tear after he played for Slovenia in EuroBasket this summer. \"I had [the] national team,\" Doncic explained. \"Playing one month or something of basketball [for Slovenia]. Obviously it's a long season ahead, so just because of that.\" Now Redick has his work cut out for him trying to fill in for James while he is sidelined for the next three to four weeks before his sciatica is scheduled to be reevaluated. \"You hope that he's back soon,\" Redick said. \"Those things can be tricky. ... It is unclear what the starting lineup is going to be, that's the reality, until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.\" Doncic, guard Austin Reaves and center Deandre Ayton will occupy three of the five spots. It's the other two starting spots that Redick will examine, with Rui Hachimura starting 57 of the 59 games he played for L.A. last season under obvious consideration. Jarred Vanderbilt , who has started both preseason games so far and is the healthiest he has been since the Lakers' 2023 trip to the Western Conference finals and free agent signees Jake LaRavia and Marcus Smart give the team different options offensively and defensively. Smart, who has also been sidelined to start the preseason because of Achilles tendinopathy, will play against the Warriors, according to Redick. Redick said he has thought about having one lineup and rotation that fits best together when James plays and a separate one for when he doesn't. Doncic said he and James have \"talked a lot\" while observing the Lakers practice from the sidelines during training camp, which has helped with chemistry. For the time being, all Doncic and the Lakers will be getting out of James during games is what the 40-year-old can provide with his voice from the bench. \"It's a big change,\" Doncic said of having to play without James. \"He's a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be 'next man up.' We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be 'next man up.' That's it.\""}

The Parties are focused on the future.\" The Knicks filed the lawsuit in August 2023, seeking more than $10 million in damages . The team alleged that the Raptors poached Ikechukwu Azotam, who worked for New York from 2020 to 2023, and ordered him to provide a trove of internal information after Toronto began recruiting him in the summer of 2023. The Knicks argued that this effort was geared toward giving the Raptors a competitive advantage. The Knicks specifically alleged that Azotam -- who worked for the team as an assistant video coordinator, then as a director of video/analytics/player development assistant -- sent the Raptors thousands of confidential files, including play frequency reports, a prep book for the 2022-23 season, video scouting files and opposition research.

The Raptors, Azotam, Toronto coach Darko Rajaković, player development coach Noah Lewis and 10 \"unknown\" employees were listed as defendants in the lawsuit. In an October 2023 court filing, the Raptors called the Knicks' allegations \"baseless\" and a \"public relations stunt.\" The Raptors argued that the \"alleged 'theft of data' involved little more than publicly available information compiled through public sources readily accessible to all NBA Members.\" The Raptors repeatedly called for NBA commissioner Adam Silver to step in and settle the dispute, and a judge in the U.S. Southern District Court in Lower Manhattan agreed . The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice, meaning it is dismissed permanently."}

Making his preseason debut for the San Antonio Spurs , Harper lofted an alley-oop to Wembanyama for a two-handed jam with 44.3 seconds left in the first half Friday of San Antonio's 134-130 victory over the Utah Jazz . Harper nodded and pointed to Wembanyama, acknowledging he might have made the play more difficult than necessary. \"I'm going to throw it a little higher,\" Harper said to a smiling Wembanyama as the teammates smacked hands while walking back. Harper's lob to Wembanyama represented just one minor flaw in what appeared to be a near-flawless performance for the rookie in the first half. He registered a game-best plus-minus of 22 over 12½ minutes, shooting 4-of-5 for nine points with two assists. Harper tacked on an additional dime in the third quarter before checking out for good with 6:23 remaining due to a minutes restriction. He played 18 minutes and finished with a plus-minus of 20. \"It's just another step for him and his young career as he's going to continue to grow,\" Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"Obviously, he made some plays, which hopefully he'll feel good about. But just to be able to do it in front of fans and in the bright lights, whether it was the plays that people will talk about when he scored, made a shot or made a good pass. Just to be able to go through team defense and run the floor, it is just invaluable experience.\" Harper said earlier in the day at shootaround that he would feel first-game jitters in his preseason debut. But he shook them off quickly. Harper flicked alley-oops to Wembanyama and Luke Kornet for his first two assists. Harper was active on defense too, defending players full court throughout most of his minutes. \"It is good to be on the court with him,\" Wembanyama said. \"He looks ready, very comfortable already throwing these kinds of passes. So I'm very confident and I'm very happy to be able to spend some time on the court with him.\" Harper scored his first bucket 10 seconds after checking into the action with 6:12 left in the opening quarter by running past his defender on a cut to the basket for a layup off an assist from Harrison Barnes . Harper zipped by former Rutgers teammate and No. 5 pick Ace Bailey for his next basket. \"Just being back out on the court with them guys, just getting the chemistry going before the season starts, it just felt good to play again,\" Harper said. \"My teammates do a great job of empowering me, and they're going to let me know what I do wrong. But ultimately, they're here to help me out and I'm here to help them out. Just having that confidence behind me is very helpful.\" Harper sat out the Spurs' first two preseason games as a precautionary measure after undergoing surgery in September to repair a partially torn collateral ligament in his left thumb. Wearing a splint on the injured thumb, Harper participated in many of the club's training camp workouts. But Spurs officials wanted to limit the 19-year-old's exposure to contact. Harper emerged from his first preseason action unscathed physically but admitted he must \"flip [my] brain\" in gauging how to accurately hit his new 7-foot-4 teammate on alley-oop passes. \"I should've [thrown] higher, a lot higher,\" Harper said. \"It's weird. Ain't no one ever played with someone that tall. You get out there. You throw it up, and you think you threw it too high. But then he catches it and you're like, 'It's a little too low.' So just little things like that. Just throw where no one else can get it but him.\""}

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

Where does your team land?", "body": "Stephen A. Smith gets amped up over how he thinks the New York Knicks will fair next season. (1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Of the 42 players listed on the Lakers' and Phoenix Suns' training camp rosters, 22 were born in the 2000s and 19 were born in the 1990s. And one, James, was born in 1984 -- five months before Suns head coach Jordan Ott. The 40-year-old James didn't play in the exhibition game after being limited to light shooting through the first three days of training camp because of nerve irritation in his glute, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. The cushion, though, worked a full night, as his seat in the locker room and during the game at the end of the bench. When James eventually emerged in the locker room, wearing a T-shirt with the \"Forever King\" tagline from his latest Nike ad campaign printed on the front, he was asked by a reporter if he was ready to begin an unprecedented 23rd season. Before James could answer, Lakers guard Austin Reaves chimed in. \"You got another five seasons in you,\" he said. James' eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face. \"Why not six or seven, get to 30?\" the reporter continued. \"Yeah, set a record!\" Reaves added. James turned toward Reaves and smirked: \"I already set a record.\" Indeed, there have been approximately 5,000 players to suit up in the NBA, and James is the only one to stick around for 23 seasons. He has also scored more regular-season points than anyone else in league history (42,184), scored more postseason points (8,289), made more All-Star games (21) and was a part of the first active father-son duo to share the court as players together when he and Bronny James checked in against the Minnesota Timberwolves on opening night last fall.

Wright Wemby, Luka, Ant? Examining the players primed to become the face of the NBA Zach Kram 2 Related The accomplishments -- including the four MVPs, four championships and four Finals MVPs -- are well-documented. But if L.A. represents the fourth quarter of James' career after the first three were spent in Cleveland, Miami and Cleveland once more, the question now is whether the clock is truly running out -- or if he will push this thing to overtime. As James embarks on his eighth season with the Lakers -- the longest consecutive stint he's had with any of the franchises he's played for -- he is playing on an expiring contract for the first time after he exercised his $52.6 million option for the 2025-26 season in June without negotiating for an extension. During the Lakers' annual media day last week, the first question James fielded was about retirement. \"I don't know,\" said James, who earned second-team All-NBA honors in his 22nd season. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to play the game that I love for another season. And however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested. Because, like you said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later.\" The Lakers, who will be without James for the next three to four weeks as he deals with sciatica in his right side, are coming off a season in which they traded for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic and secured the No. 3 seed in the hyper-competitive Western Conference. But they fell to the No. 6-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. After James opted into his contract to stay in L.A., his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, issued a statement to ESPN's Shams Charania that many interpreted as an indication that James could finish his career somewhere else. \"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. ... We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career.\" And after having full control over his career for his first 22 years, what's best and what's realistic could prove to be at odds. Here are the four possible ways this unprecedented season could go for James and the Lakers. LeBron James is excited about his Lakers squad this season and isn't sweating being in a contract year. James' time with the Lakers has seen him battle a rash of injuries that caused him to miss 124 games in seven seasons after he had missed only 71 in his first 15 years in the league. The Lakers' brass has cycled through four head coaches and the front office has had a mixed record on its trades and signings. Still, there has been plenty of success. The Lakers won a championship in 2020, with James becoming the first player in history to take home Finals MVP for three different teams. The franchise celebrated James in grand fashion when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer in 2023. And in 2024, the Lakers used the No. 55 pick to draft Bronny, allowing James to achieve what he had stated as his last remaining priority when he told ESPN, \"I need to be on the floor with my boy.\" A few months before the 2024 draft, the Golden State Warriors inquired about trading for James. The Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested. After the trade talks had passed, James expressed his commitment to the franchise. \"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and [have] been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said. Lakers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka, speaking at his annual season-opening news conference a few days before media day, made it clear where the franchise stands. \"We would love if LeBron's story would be, he retired a Laker,\" Pelinka said. \"That would be a positive story.\" While several sources close to James have told ESPN that it is unknown how the end of his career will play out, it could help James' desire to play on the best Lakers' team possible this season if it appears he has more basketball in him.

The Lakers can trade either their 2031 or 2032 first-round pick this season and have the right to swap firsts in five seasons in any deals they pursue this season, but they could be reticent to use those assets to invest in a team built for Doncic and James, if James is on the way out. For those looking for clues, there are a few out there. The Nike \"Forever King\" ad features a narrator speaking about James' career in the past tense -- \"They called him the Chosen One ... We were all witnesses.\" The Cleveland Cavaliers' \"Classic Edition\" uniform for this season is the same style James wore when he came into the league as a rookie with the Cavs in 2003-04. The NBA schedule makers had L.A.'s first home game of the season and last road game of the season both be against Stephen Curry and the Warriors, a fitting way for the two most important players of their era to have a proper send-off, if James is indeed on his last lap. And after media day, on his Instagram account, James posted a compilation of moments from the day with Lenny Kravitz's \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\" playing underneath, possibly hinting at the end. Pelinka's answer at the news conference about James retiring with the Lakers was telling because he answered a different question than he was asked. He was asked if the Lakers would be interested in re-signing James in the summer of 2026. L.A. is projected to have approximately $50 million in cap space, which would all be swallowed up by James if he was to seek a new max contract. James will be eligible to sign up to a three-year deal for $188 million, with a starting salary of $58.1 million for 2026-27, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks. As great as James has been, extending his prime well beyond any reasonable actuarial table, there is a natural question as to how his timeline syncs up with the team's two other best players, both of whom are in their mid 20s. Doncic and Reaves, for their part, love playing with James and want the partnership to continue, sources told ESPN. Both players have not inquired with James about when he plans to retire, sources said, wanting to show respect for James' process. Doncic, who idolized James growing up, has enjoyed their partnership and believes James is vital to L.A.'s ability to win now, sources said. He is also undaunted by any spectacle or circus that could come with pairing up with James as he closes out his career because Doncic already experienced an aging legend on his farewell tour when Dirk Nowitzki's last season with the Dallas Mavericks coincided with Doncic's rookie year. Doncic found the time with Nowitzki to be invaluable, sources said. Plus, if the Lakers happen to win the championship this season -- bringing James' career total to five -- would he see that as a perfect ending, or would he want to come back to try to defend it and tie Michael Jordan with six? Tim Bontemps remains unsure on whether LeBron James will continue to play for the Lakers beyond next season. Paul's statement to ESPN in June established James' final priority as the curtain falls on his career: to win. That means, if L.A. is struggling -- whether because of injuries, poor roster fits, or simply because the team isn't good enough to thrive in the crowded West -- James could opt to leave. Since James holds a no-trade clause in his contract, any deal would need a greenlight from James to be executed. The problem is, there are not many viable destinations for him.

Because of their apron limitations, the Cavs would also be prevented from signing James off the waiver wire if he reached a buyout with L.A. The Warriors and New York Knicks would also be ineligible to sign James in that scenario. Then there's the Mavericks. James has won titles with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving , and has close relationships with coach Jason Kidd and several members of Kidd's staff. But the Mavs, too, would need to send out an exorbitant amount of money to make a deal work, according to Marks. Dallas is also currently a second-apron team, and would need to trade $12 million in salary without taking any back in order to become a buyout destination for James. There are 10 teams projected to have significant cap space in the summer of 2026, including the Brooklyn Nets , LA Clippers and Chicago Bulls , and there could be options for James that are currently unforeseen. However, it would be a major life change to leave Southern California when Savannah (his wife) and Zhuri (his daughter) live there, Bronny is under contract with the Lakers, and Bryce (his son) is a short flight away at the University of Arizona. And James will be in a free agent pool that potentially includes other stars such as Kevin Durant , Trae Young and James Harden -- plus impact players such as Reaves, Draymond Green , Bradley Beal , Norman Powell and Coby White -- so it's not a given he would receive endless interest around the league. And so James' situation remains undecided, and it's yet to be determined whether his 23rd season will be a countdown toward the end of his career or merely the bridge to a 24th, or beyond. Or whether his body will make the decision for him. \"Everyone is trying to dictate when he's done and the reality is nobody actually knows,\" a source close to James told ESPN. James, for his part, says he isn't concerned with the future for now. \"Not worried about yesterday and not trying to focus on what the future holds,\" he told ESPN. \"It's about staying present. ... Because like I said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it is not as long [away as] 'The Godfather 2.' So I know I got to stay present.\""}

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: Is there any hope for Joel Embiid and the Sixers?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-is-there-any-hope-for-joel-embiid-and-the-sixers/", "published_at": "2025-10-11T15:43:33+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Philadelphia 76ers, who are on the two-timeline plan", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Jared McCain's rookie season ended in mid-December of last year, but he still managed to play more minutes (592) than Joel Embiid did (574) for the 2024-25 Philadelphia 76ers . The same is true of reserves Jeff Dowtin Jr. (621), who was on a two-way contract and also played 17 games for the Sixers' G League team; Kyle Lowry (659), who barely played for the final three months; and Jared Butler (682), who joined the team at the trade deadline. In all, 15 players logged more minutes than Embiid did for last season's Sixers. The guy who played the fifth-most minutes, Ricky Council IV , is not currently on an NBA roster. (The Brooklyn Nets were reportedly going to bring him to camp if not for an injury.) Paul George missed half the games, too, and, by the end of the regular season, they were in full tank mode, trying to hang on to their top-six-protected pick. For a franchise that had invested about $400 million in Embiid and George the previous summer, it was an absolute nightmare. Good news, though: 2024-25 is over. The late tank worked, and, if you're a Sixers fan who hasn't already purchased a V.J. Edgecombe jersey, you've likely at least considered it. McCain will miss the start of the season because of a thumb injury, and neither George nor Embiid has played in the preseason, but, in theory, Philly will soon get a proper look at the team it has put together. The hope is that the ceiling is just as high as the Sixers envisioned when they're at full health and that the floor is nowhere near as low as it was last season. Last year: Just about everything that could do wrong did go wrong until the night of the lottery. The miserable, 24-win season did have some silver linings, though: Tyrese Maxey improved his point-of-attack defense, McCain looked like the Rookie of the Year during the brief period in which he was healthy and Quentin Grimes , acquired for Caleb Martin at the deadline, played like the guy the Knicks didn't want to trade for Donovan Mitchell four years ago . Guerschon Yabusele becoming a fan favorite and Justin Edwards emerging late in the season were small victories, too. The offseason: They grabbed Edgecombe with the No. 3 pick, used the No. 35 pick on stretch big Johni Broome and re-signed Edwards for three years and $7.1 million with a team option. They also re-signed Eric Gordon and Lowry and signed Trendon Watford away from Brooklyn, all on minimum contracts. Yabusele left for the Knicks , and they used two of their two-way slots on Jabari Walker and Dominick Barlow, who might have a chance to take some of his minutes. After a long standoff, Grimes signed the one-year qualifying offer. Las Vegas over/under: 42.5 wins, per BetMGM Sixers believer: Nothing about last season was fun in Philadelphia, but, with the exception of winning a championship, it was the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. By bottoming out, the Sixers were able to draft V.J. Edgecombe, who is probably a future star and definitely going to help them immediately. Daryl Morey's front office also learned from all the things that went wrong in 2024-25, as they've put together a significantly younger, more athletic roster than they had a year ago. Everyone except Tom Ziller seems afraid to say it, but the 2025-26 Sixers can be contenders if they are relatively healthy this time around. I know you're about to hit me with the same tired, boring \"Joel Embiid can't be relied upon anymore\" take that I've heard a million times, but once he's back on the court and looking like himself again, you'll change your tune. Sixers skeptic: The reason you've heard so many people say Embiid can't be relied upon anymore is not that there's some sort of anti-Philadelphia conspiracy going around. It's just the truth, no matter how much you and I wish it were not. The Sixers drafted Embiid 11 years ago, and the only time he has ever finished a season healthy was 2019-20 in the bubble. Embiid himself has acknowledged that playing through his knee injury -- and Bell's palsy -- in the 2024 playoffs was not the wisest decision. What scares me the most about Embiid is not that he barely played basketball last season, but the way he moved when he did play. At this point, I don't understand how anyone could be confident that he'll get back to an MVP level, let alone sustain it. Sixers believer: I'm assuming you agree with this statement about Embiid: \"Everyone has to consider the possibility that no surgery and rehabilitation, no matter how cautious and thorough, will ever be enough to keep him on the court for long.\" Sixers skeptic: Yeah, obviously. Sixers believer: Great. It's from a Philadelphia Inquirer article that is more than 10 years old . Before you write off Embiid, please remember that, before he had played a single second in the NBA, plenty of people were doing the same thing. His injury history has always been a cause for concern, but he has already overcome it to be named an All-Star seven years in a row and win an MVP award. Please don't act shocked if and when he makes this sentiment seem foolish again. Sixers skeptic: Can we talk about the rest of the team? There are only so many ways to say that Embiid is a massive question mark, and pointing out that the organization has been walking this tightrope for more than a decade definitely doesn't make me feel any better about it. Weren't you a little spooked when, with Embiid and Tyrese Maxey out of the lineup, Paul George scored a measly two points on 1-for-7 shooting in 36 minutes in Brooklyn in February? How do you feel about George having arthroscopic knee surgery in the summer and Jared McCain vlogging about another injury ? I get the Edgecombe excitement, but aren't you a little disappointed that the Sixers didn't keep Guerschon Yabusele or re-sign Quentin Grimes on a long-term contract? It's hard for me to flush last season when this season's vibes are already weird. Sixers believer: Actually, I have some questions for you about the San Antonio Spurs : Weren't you spooked by how inefficient De'Aaron Fox was in the 17 games he played for them last season? How do you feel about him missing all of preseason -- and probably some real games -- because of a hamstring injury? It's not a great sign that Stephon Castle is already dealing with a bruised knee, is it? Are you sure that Victor Wembanyama is going to stay healthy after missing almost half of last season? To be clear, I'm not seriously saying that everybody should be freaking out about the Spurs, but it's annoying that McCain had thumb surgery just three weeks after No. 2 pick Dylan Harper did and only the former is treated like a bad omen. Let's respect the Sixers' history of genuinely insane stuff happening by not overreacting to minor snags! And by the way, San Antonio's crowded backcourt and collective lack of shooting are bigger problems than any non-health-related issue with Philly's roster, and the Sixers have the benefit of playing in the East. George is 35, but the fact that he remained an elite defender last season indicates that his decline has been greatly exaggerated (as has the importance of that one game in which he was dealing with three separate injuries). McCain won't miss many games that matter. Grimes can still re-sign next summer, and, as much as I'll miss Yabu, I expect Trendon Watford to more or less make up for his absence. Sixers skeptic: If every single Spurs player except Wemby tears his Achilles next week, I'd still feel better about their future than Philadelphia's. There's no double standard here; one of these teams has the brightest future imaginable and the other one will be paying Embiid and George about $120 million combined in 2027-28. What sucks the most about the position the Sixers are in is that, if you ignore those two signings, they've made some amazing moves over the last few years! They got Maxey with the No. 21 pick, McCain with the No. 16 pick and Edgecombe with a pick they weren't really supposed to have. The Grimes trade was highway robbery, the Kelly Oubre Jr . signing (and re-signing) worked out as well as they could have hoped and Justin Edwards looks like a nice find. Adem Bona might be, too, and, after Yabusele (another smart signing) walked, it made sense to pick up Watford. Unfortunately, though, there's no mechanism for a clean transition to the post-Embiid era, so the Sixers are stuck doing the two-timelines thing. This has already cost them. While it's understandable that they wanted to stay under the first apron and maintain their ability to get under the tax with a trade, these constraints prevented them from paying Yabusele and Grimes what they're worth. Compromising in that way was a tell: No matter what Morey says, the organization isn't really all-in on this group anymore. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The question caused Lakers coach JJ Redick to say he was “not being combative\" with his answer. Asked if the Lakers are missing opportunities to practice more and build on-court chemistry because of their busy six-game preseason slate, Redick was quick to wonder why reporters were so concerned about the situation. “You guys are really harping on this,” Redick responded. So, Redick was asked, is it a thing or is it not a thing? “I’m not being combative right now,” Redick said. “I just want to acknowledge that you guys, like the last four days, like it’s becoming a little bit obsessive with all these questions about opportunities lost. So, I will answer it again. These are the cards that we were dealt. I sure would like everybody to be healthy.” Making the most out of the situation, the Lakers held off the Golden State Warriors 126-116 Sunday night at Crypto.com Arena despite not playing with LeBron James (sciatica), Luka Doncic and Marcus Smart (Achilles tendinopathy). Redick said the plan is for Smart to “get two games [in] this week.” Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue The Lakers have three remaining preseason games: Tuesday at Phoenix, Wednesday at Las Vegas against the Dallas Mavericks and Friday against the visiting Sacramento Kings — four games over a six-day span. Redick was reminded that the Lakers as an organization have chosen to play six preseason games — the maximum allowed by the NBA. “It’s something to be discussed I think going forward,” Redick said. “I think it’s awesome. I really do because we got to play in Palm Springs and I think it’s awesome that we get to play in Vegas and I recognize that there’s Lakers fans all over the world that maybe don’t get the chance to see us play. \"You hope that we can find some sort of balance in the future to get more practice time, less travel time. I’m sure at some point we’ll be one of the teams going overseas, so then that adds another scenario.\" Redick did say for training camp purposes, practice tends to be more helpful in team building than preseason games. “I think more practices would be beneficial,\" Redick said. “I do think the exposure to a game situation and playing against an opponent is very beneficial. You don’t have a lot of days anymore and to try to cram six games in there [and] four games in six nights, it’s significantly difficult.” Against the Warriors on Sunday, Austin Reaves (21 points), Dalton Knecht (16), Rui Hachimura (16) and Deandre Ayton (14 points, eight rebounds, five assists) were on top of their games. For Ayton, who was six for eight from the field and had a blocked shot, his joy came from the fans cheering him on. Sure, it was only a preseason game, but Ayton loved the vibe and the positive energy he felt. It was Ayton’s first time playing at Crypto.com Arena since he signed a two-year, $16.6-million deal with the Lakers. “It hit me in the whole arena today just hearing the fans and everybody cheering,” Ayton said. “It was kind of an unusual sound other than boos. ... It was everybody showing love and welcoming me to L.A. I played so freely and I had a lot of fun.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

The Sacramento Kings will be without forward Keegan Murray to start the season. Murray suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb during the team’s preseason loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night, the team announced on Sunday afternoon. Murray is set to undergo surgery in the near future, and he’ll be evaluated again in four-to-six weeks. [ Get more Kings news: Sacramento team feed ] If Murray is out the full six weeks, he could be eligible to return for the Kings' matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 24, the team’s 18th game of the season. Murray averaged 12.4 points and 6.7 rebounds last season, his third in the league after the Kings took him with the No. 4 overall pick in 2022. He’s missed just 13 games throughout his career due to injury. The former Iowa standout is entering the final year of his initial four-year, $36.3 million deal with the franchise, and he’s eligible for an extension this month. If Murray and the Kings can’t get a deal done, he’ll enter restricted free agency next summer. The 25-year-old has been a reliable piece in the Kings’ starting lineup over the past three seasons, and he’ll presumably play a big role in the team’s effort to make it back to the postseason — something they’ve only done once in the past two decades. The Kings went 40-42 last season and ended up firing head coach Mike Brown. The team eventually promoted interim head coach Doug Christie to replace him permanently. The Kings will open the regular season on Oct. 22 against the Phoenix Suns. It’s unclear who will take Murray’s place in the starting lineup in the meantime, though Christie experimented with rookie Maxime Raynaud at the position on Sunday, according to the Sacramento Bee . The Kings took Raynaud with the No. 42 overall pick in the draft earlier this summer out of Stanford, where he averaged 20.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. “In our league, two bigs, we’re starting to see quite a bit, so it’s one of the things I think that you’ve got to look at,” Christie said. “Max is a talented player. This is the preseason, so to get him out there and to get him those types of reps is more what that’s about. We’ve got a couple other options over the next couple days that we’ll throw out there.”"}

Vying for a starting position in the backcourt, Brandin Podziemski took advantage of being a focal point of the Warriors’ offense. Podziemski had nine points through the first half and then caught fire in the third, scoring 14. The Warriors then only trailed by five points going into the fourth quarter because of Podziemski's efforts. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Podziemski’s night was done, leaving the comeback attempt to the rest of his teammates. But Sunday night in LA belonged to Podziemski, showing how he can be a reliable scorer and playmaker, especially when the Warriors aren’t at full strength. Podziemski in 26 minutes scored 23 points on 10-of-16 shooting and also had five rebounds and eight assists. He was a plus-6.

Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Down their top two players, adding Horford and Moody to the list of Warriors absences called for an interesting starting five. Coach Steve Kerr started with Podziemski, Buddy Hield, Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green and Quinten Post. Moody is out the rest of the preseason and will be re-evaluated in a week with what the Warriors are calling a strained calf. “We’re not too concerned about it. It’s just we’re being careful,” Kerr told reporters in LA. The age of the Warriors’ top players already guarantees Kerr will have to be comfortable with multiple combinations and consistently tinker with who his starters are. This was the perfect opportunity for several young Warriors and role players to step up. The score was tied 13-13 when Kerr made his first substitution, bringing Gary Payton II in for Post. Golden State’s starting five began the second half together, and came out strong trying to cut down a 17-point deficit. The Lakers’ lead was cut to 10 points with the Warriors outscoring the Lakers 21-14 through the first five and a half minutes of the third quarter when Kerr brought Payton in for Post. Offense will have to run through Kuminga on nights that Curry and Butler are out. There were moments where he showed he can step up with more responsibility, and others where consistency continues to be a problem. Kuminga in the first quarter twice took advantage of Dalton Knecht switching onto him in the post. He also had three assists in the first quarter. Then in the second, Kuminga went from getting his ankles crossed on defense to throwing down an explosive dunk that only he can slam left-handed with ease and authority. No. 1, Jonathan Kuminga pic.twitter.com/IiIsaLsEB2 JK what was that??? 📺 NBA League Pass pic.twitter.com/7chWeOeMI6 Kuminga in the first half scored nine points on 4-of-6 shooting and had four assists. His fourth was a dime to Pat Spencer cutting into the paint for a layup. But Kuminga also didn’t have one rebound at halftime, led the Warriors with five turnovers and was a game-low minus-18. There were highs and lows in Kuminga’s third game of the preseason. Kuminga played 22 minutes and scored an efficient 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting. He dominated around the rim, but missed his only 2-point shot outside the paint and badly forced one of his three 3-point attempts. Jonathan Kuminga dominated around the rim Kind of an up-and-down game, but the process has been positive pic.twitter.com/LpHp35Fgu3 The process overall has been positive. Kuminga is keeping his eyes up and mostly has been in flow of the offense. He finished with no rebounds, six assists and five turnovers as a minus-10. Between offseason additions and the development of certain players, Kerr has raved over the space these Warriors can create. He now can have an offense that plays four-out, or even five-out. When at full strength, that is. The end of the first quarter saw a unit of Pat Spencer, Will Richard, Payton, Gui Santos and Trayce Jackson-Davis struggle to score with very little spacing. None of those five are considered threats to shoot from long distance. The start of the second quarter also was a struggle. That group featured Podziemski, Hield, Kuminga, Santos and Jackson-Davis. Those five give Kerr one surefire 3-point threat in Hield, and a hopeful second with Podziemski. The Warriors as a team in the first half shot 19 percent from three, going 4 of 21. Payton was the only bench player to make a three, and no Warrior made multiple threes. They also didn’t attempt a single free throw in the first half, while the Lakers went 13 of 15 at the line. After making only four 3-pointers in the first half, the Warriors made three in the first two and a half minutes of the third quarter – two by Post and one from Podziemski – and five for the entire quarter. The Warriors made two more threes than the Lakers, 14 to 12, but shot a lowly 32.6 percent, which was far lower than LA’s 44.4 percent clip. Podziemski, Post and LJ Cryer were the only Warriors to make more than one three. Richard (1 of 6), Santos (1 of 5) and Spencer (1 of 5) combined to go 3 of 17 on threes.

Embiid featured Sunday in the Sixers’ annual Blue-White scrimmage at Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington, Delaware. And he shared the floor with another big man in Adem Bona. Nurse confirmed after the scrimmage that he’s “trying to look at Bona and Joel together.” With Paul George sidelined as he works back from a left knee injury and Trendon Watford out because of right hamstring tightness, it’s not yet clear how the Sixers will divvy up power forward minutes. Two-way contract player Dominick Barlow has played well this preseason and fellow two-way Jabari Walker has also been in the mix. Bona is an unconventional option, although Nurse noted his role may not change much alongside Embiid. The 22-year-old stuck almost exclusively to dunks, layups, put-backs and the occasional post-up his rookie year. In contrast, Embiid’s jump shooting and overall array of offensive skills have historically been giant strengths. “I think there’s kind of an open position at the four, especially right now with Paul not being quite ready yet,” Nurse said. “There’s a number of guys that we’re trying to work into that spot. … (Bona) is probably going to be more of the five. He’s going to play down toward the basket, rim protect and things like that. There’s certainly some drives and dump-offs to him … that are high-percentage plays. I like that part. He’ll help the rebounding, he’ll help the rim protection. We’ll see how it goes.”’ Bona brought his typical shot swatting to the scrimmage and stared down Johni Broome after denying the rookie a dunk. He’s pleased at the prospect of playing next to Embiid. “I think it brings another dynamic to the team,” Bona said. “It’s going to bring a huge amount of size and presence in the paint.” While Bona measured a tad over 6-foot-8 without shoes at the NBA draft combine , he indeed plays much bigger. The UCLA product’s wingspan is a shade under 7-4. He posted a 40-inch maximum vertical leap at the combine and sure seems to have added to that. Of course, most Sixers projections ride on Embiid’s health. He scrimmaged Sunday, moved smoothly and scored plenty. Joel Embiid with the slam at Sixers’ Blue-White scrimmage: pic.twitter.com/ocr2k27ZJd The Sixers have avoided timelines in discussing Embiid’s return from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. The scrimmage was his first live action in front of a crowd since Feb. 22. “I knew this would be the first time you guys had seen him for a long time,” Nurse said. “I don’t know how many weeks this is now — I’m losing track — but he’s been out there playing. Again, just trying to continue to progress. “Today was a good progression day. Lots of running, lots of 5-on-5, lots of early practice stuff, lots of 5-on-0. … And then he went out there and did his thing. He shot the ball well, he scored well, he orchestrated the offense well. I thought he ran pretty good as well — both directions.” Bona would love to see all of that translate to games. When the Sixers drafted him, he envisioned frontcourt minutes with Embiid. “I’ve been working toward that,” he said, “and I’m really excited to see how that’s going to look.”"}

Brooklyn is going to lean into Cam Thomas — playing for his next contract on the qualifying offer — and Michael Porter Jr. to drive their offense. But if you had any doubts about the plan, here is what team owner Joe Tsai said while on the All-In podcast (hat tip RealGM ). “I have to say we’re in a rebuilding year. We spent all of our pick (in the 2025 NBA Draft). We had five first-round draft picks this past summer ... “We have one [first-round] pick in 2026, and we hope to get a good pick. So, you can predict what kind of strategy we will use for this season. But we have a very young team.” This upcoming NBA Draft is considered a strong draft at the top with Darryn Peterson (Kansas), A.J. Dybantsa (BYU) and Cameron Boozer (Duke) all in the mix for the No. 1 pick, with some other real talent such as Nate Ament (Tennessee), Mikel Brown (Louisville) and Tounde Yessoufou (Baylor) worth keeping an eye on. Brooklyn isn’t the only team starting this season with an eye toward the draft, the same idea is playing out in Utah and Washington, and you can be sure a few other teams with long-shot postseason hopes will be pivoting to the strategy early. The Nets control their own pick this season, but in 2027 the Houston Rockets have swap rights. Starting in 2028, the Nets will have their own first-round picks and/or first-round picks or swaps coming in from the Knicks, 76ers and Nuggets. A Division of NBCUniversal .

He chose not to pick up his $3.5 million player option in Denver (not a shock after he had a locker room clash with Aaron Gordon during the playoffs), but no team has stepped up yet with a deal to replace it. Despite rumored offers for him in China, Westbrook is staying put stateside, and his most likely landing spot remains the team he flirted with all summer, the Sacramento Kings. Here is what ESPN’s Shams Charania reported on NBA Today . “I’m told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings. And the Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that, and he’s got relationships across that organization. Domantas Sabonis, he’s close with, played with him. He played with Dennis Schroeder as well, DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine. They have L.A. ties as well. BJ Armstrong, the new assistant general manager there. He knows BJ Armstrong from the agency side, and he does have respect with Scott Perry, their new general manager, and Doug Christie, their new head coach. We’ll see if a deal gets done before the start of the season or during this upcoming year.” Charania is not the only one reporting this, well-connected Sacramento radio guy Carmichael Dave called it “70/30 Russell Westbrook joins the Kings this year.” If the sides can figure out the money. Sacramento does have an open roster spot and is about $5.4 million below the luxury tax line. Dennis Schroder will start at the point, but unless second-year player Devin Carter is ready to make a big leap up to backup point guard, that role falls more to Malik Monk, who is better as an off-ball two guard (but can play some point). It’s easy to see where he slots into the roster, the question is money. Westbrook, 37, averaged 13.3 points and 6.1 assists a game last season for the Nuggets, and he remains one of the highest energy players in the game. However, he’s not a consistent or efficient scorer at this point in his career, nor is he a great defender. He could fill a bench role, as he has done the past couple of seasons, but don’t be shocked if we get into the season before a team makes that offer. Sacramento is also a roster that could look very different at the end of the season. This is a team open to trading DeRozan, LaVine or Sabonis if the deal is right. Where Westbrook would slot into all that is a question for coach Doug Christie. A Division of NBCUniversal .

At some point during the Lakers ’ preseason, Luka Doncic will play in a game. The question is when. Even after being a full participant in practice Saturday, Lakers coach JJ Redick said that Doncic was “TBD” (to be determined) when asked if his star guard would play in Sunday’s exhibition game against the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. Redick said Austin Reaves will play and that Marcus Smart will see action in his first preseason game of the season. The Lakers will play six preseason games, three of them coming after the game against the Warriors. After practice, Doncic was asked when he would play. Read more: LeBron James to miss Lakers' opening game because of sciatica issue “I don’t know yet,” he said. “We got to talk about it — JJ and my team. So, I don’t know yet. But I’m probably going to end up playing two games of the preseason.” When the regular season starts Oct. 21 at home against the Warriors, Doncic will not have running mate LeBron James beside him. James was diagnosed with sciatica nerve issue on his right side, the Lakers announced to the media Thursday, saying that he’ll be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks. James and Doncic formed a great partnership when they played together after the shocking blockbuster trade last February. Not having James to start the season has to be unsettling for Doncic and the Lakers. “It’s a big change,” Doncic said. “He’s a great player. He can help us a lot. But at the end of the day, our mentality needs to be next man up. We got a group of guys that have been practicing and hopefully LeBron can join us as soon as possible. We are going to obviously need him. But our mentality has got to be next man up. That’s it.” Doncic will get plenty of help from Reaves, Smart, Deandre Ayton, Jared Vanderbilt and others with James out. Still, the assumption is that Doncic will have to carry a heavy load with James sidelined. “No. I don’t view it that way,” Doncic said. “I just want to play basketball. If I do less, if I do more, whatever it takes for me to get a win.” James hasn’t practiced at all, but Doncic said that hasn’t stopped the two of them from figuring out the team can still function at a high level. “It’s not everything about on the court. That’s what I’ve been saying,” Doncic said. “It’s about chemistry off the court, too. So, obviously, now it’s a little more off the court, but while we watched practices this week, we talked a lot about it.” They had known over the summer that James had been dealing with “the nerve irritation,” Redick said, and so it wasn’t a total surprise James is going to be out with a sciatica issue. Redick said James has been on the court “every day” doing individual work. He just hasn’t been able to practice with his teammates. Redick was asked how James' inability to participate in practice affected his game planning for practice and going into the season knowing that he won’t be available for a while. \" No, no effect on practice planning,” Redick said. “And we haven't game-planned yet, so, no effect.” Redick had not put too much emphasis on his starting lineup during training camp and during the preseason games. But with James turning 41 in December, entering his 23rd season and being injured in training camp, Redick was asked if he could foresee having a lineup with James starting and another with him out. \" Potentially. Yeah,” he said. “Something that certainly has crossed my mind in the last couple days. Yeah…You hope that he's back soon. That's, those things are, those things can be tricky. So it, I don't think it's … “We knew this going into camp, so it wasn't like it's changed anything for how we want to practice or what our philosophies are with the preseason games. It is unclear who's gonna be, what the starting lineup is gonna be. That's the reality until he is back. We'll have to figure that out.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A spokesperson for the teams gave ESPN this statement: “The Knicks and [Raptors owner] Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment withdrew their respective claims and the matter is resolved. The Parties are focused on the future.” The lawsuit was over something seen as commonplace in NBA circles (sources who had been in similar jobs told NBC Sports at the time that this was no big deal and the suit seemed “very James Dolan”). New York was seeking $10 million in damages from Toronto for the alleged “theft of trade secrets” when the Raptors hired away New York’s director of video/analytics/and a player development assistant coach, Ikechukwu Azotam. In the suit, the Knicks alleged that the Raptors organization — at the behest of rookie head coach Darko Rajakovic — took more than 3,000 confidential, proprietary files, including video scouting files and play frequency numbers. Part of the Knicks’ argument was that Rajakovic didn’t have the depth of background to build a team structure, so he stole that from New York. That despite the fact that Rajakovic had been a legendary head coach in Serbia, was head coach of the Tulsa 66ers of the G-League, and was an assistant known for player development with the Thunder, Suns and Grizzlies. Toronto’s first counterargument was that this had to be decided by the NBA league office and commissioner Adam Silver, not the courts. Toronto reached out to the NBA’s general council and pointed out that the NBA’s constitution (Article 24, bylaw “D”) states: “The Commissioner shall have exclusive, full, complete, and final jurisdiction of any dispute involving two (2) or more Members of the Association.” Dolan, who has had a long-running feud with Silver, did not feel the commissioner would be an unbiased arbiter of the situation.

That staff was also together for the World Cup in the Philippines the year before. Kerr said being an assistant coach for Team USA matters before moving over to the big chair. “I think the assistant coaching is almost a prerequisite for coaching USA,” Kerr said. “It’s really a different job, and now he has that experience, just like I did with [Gregg Popovich], in the World Cup in ’19 and the Olympics in ’21. “Spo is a perfect choice. He’s gonna be great.” Spoelstra is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA, entering his 18th season, and has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (2012 and 2013). In a sign of how respected he is around the league, a poll of NBA GMs voted him the “best coach in the NBA” as well as the best manager and motivator of players. Spoelstra’s contract with USA Basketball is not finalized and has to be approved by the organization’s board of directors, but that is all expected to be wrapped up before the end of the month.

However, there’s one trait of his that head coach Jason Kidd is most impressed by, according to Eddie Sefko of NBA.com : his toughness. “ His willingness to compete at a high level and his willingness to be uncomfortable ,” Kidd said when asked what parts of Flagg’s games stood out early on. “ He absorbs that. I think those are his superpowers. His winning DNA â he stood in line a little bit longer to get that at a very high level. Heâs all about winning. â Kidd spoke excitedly about the potential of Flagg and young center Dereck Lively II to grow together, as well as their ability to impact winning in the near-term. That quality, along with the toughness, is what Kidd values the most in Flagg. “ Itâs not about how many shots he gets or how many minutes or how many times he touches the ball ,” Kidd said. “ Heâs about the team. Heâs about winning. Thatâs the biggest thing that stands out — he competes to win .” We have more on the Mavs: Start Washington and Gafford until mid season then start Flagg and Lively I also think they should take their time with Flagg. PJ can start, no big deal. Eventually Cooper will get his mins.

According to head Steve Kerr , the Warriors are “not too concerned” about the injury, which occurred in practice. Slater adds that the team is hopeful that Moody can return in time for the season opener. Moody started both of the Warriors’ preseason games to this point, averaging 14.5 points and 1.0 steal per contest while hitting seven of his 12 three-point attempts. After years of being in and out of the Warriors’ rotation, Moody seems to have finally carved out a role for himself as a floor spacer and versatile wing defender in Kerr’s main rotation. If he were to miss time to open the season, it could open the door for Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield to earn extra minutes. Right when he looked primed for a true breakout season…I will say this, as much as I love his game, profile and overall potential, Moses Moody sure is injury prone. I do comp him to Kawhi pretty often, I see “something in the realm of Kawhi” as Moody’s highest ceiling, like, his best season could be on that level. If he can stop being injured. Much like Kawhi. Every time he starts looking like he is ready to take it to the next level he gets hurt. Just a strained calf. I think heâll be fine. The life of a professional athlete involves setbacks from time to time. Moses Moody Postseason Stats – NBA | FOX Sports In the 2025 NBA playoffs, Moses Moody averaged 16 mins, 7.1 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 1.2 assists across 12 games. Yeah if next level is Rotation player. Seriously. You spent months trashing everyone who had one criticism of Kuminga. Now you feel it is ok for you to trash anyone. What a hypocrite. He played 3 months with a torn ligament in his shooting hand. It was painful for him to shoot. Gawd. How pathetic. I never spent time trashing anyone.. only you and Warriors fans did the trashing of Kuminga. Get it right !!!! I said you are all crybabies for trashing him. And now You are defending Moody cause I said he was a rotation player. Sounds like more crying to me. What is he like the next Poole !!!!! For months, you went on and on about how the Warriors had to dump their offense, that had sent them to six finals, and four rings, and install Kuminga as their #1 offensive threat. You kept crying about how Kuminga is the Second Coming. You kept lashing out at people who said he needs to look learn to work with in the offense. Moody learned work within the offense and started have some success before he got injured. He gritted it out for the team. Why can’t you give him some credit for that? Moody is definitely not like Poole. Damn bro you keep receipts on here? Make up all you want. I donât care if Warriors win or lose. I donât care if they win the title. I only posted about Kuminga and the crybabies. I just said Moody was a rotation player. Thats a problem for you lmao â¦.. you drunk lol Poole was the next Curry for a time for Warrior fans on here. So what is exactly your fascination with Moody. More than a ROTATION player ???? That makes him the next Poole â- who is a 1way player but does put up 17-18 a game. The kleenex are on tgeir way DoorDash If you don’t care about the Warriors, then why did you keep spending months whining and crying about how Kuminga is a victim. You kept saying that should be the Warriors #1 scorer. Moody is nothing like Poole. Moody just goes about his business working hard and contributing. Poole said was “legendary” after one good season. How can you confuse the two? Calling out Warriors fans tor their trashing of Kuminga. Is only posting the truth. Making fun of Warriors fans incessant whining and crying about Kumingas status. Was entertaining a bit. Considering how all you have jumped on the bandwagon. Iâm sure there is much more Kuminga drama to come. You can be sure I will be watching. So why are you avoiding the question. Is Moody going to be the guy to watch this year. Cause him starting or even playing more than 20 mins. Is a step up for him. Or did you miss All of last year. There you go again. JK is such a delicate little flower. We are all such meanies. You can never have criticisms about him. He is such the perfect little child. I guess you missed all of last year. Moody played well over 20 minutes a game and doubled his career starts in the 2nd half of the season while in a playoff push. I thought you knew everything. The gym class hero had a couple lucky preseason games and got everyone all hyped up. Needed to fabricate a new excuse for when he falls off the next game he plays. He faked it just like Keegan Murray. Keegan literally having surgery, hard to fake that Surgery is literally one of the easiest things to fake. You just put a cast on and people will believe you. And Moody had surgery also. But, you kept saying he lied about it. You still haven’t presented proof he lied. I did not say that. And you still haven’t presented proof that I did Oh excuse me. You said he “faked” the injury and surgery. So, when he talked about it after he “fake recovery”, is that still “faking” it? Or it that lying? I did not say that, and you still have not presented proof that I did Moses Moody still sucks. He always has. Heâs in over his head. But his shooting could be useful in the starting lineup with this bunch. In fact, theyâll need him for that. Heâs still going to get shipped out of town in February along with JK for whatever they can get as a rotational guy. The writing is on the wall and Iâm never wrong (lol just kidding.) Same as this Victor Oladipo talk this week, lol. I think somebody here trashed me for saying âheâs doneâ earlier in the summer. Is it necessary for me to say it again? Victor Oladipo is done. Mac McClung does not belong in the NBA. Thereâs no way Jonathan Kuminga takes the qualifying offer. Al Horford is absolutely signing with the Warriors. Moses Moody sucks. What else do you want to know? Start Heild. Have Moody be the sixth man type âAfter years of being in and out of the Warriorsâ rotation, Moody seems to have finally carved out a role for himself as a floor spacer and versatile wing defender in Kerrâs main rotation. If he were to miss time, it could open the door for Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield to earn extra minutes.â The article and his own coach. Consider a rotation piece, player a step UP. Yet some of us canât handle that. Doesnât seem like a serious injury. Nobody is game shape yet. Always better to be cautious with injuries at this time. Kuminga and Podz have looked good against Lakers Wow surprised by the amount of hate Moody is getting on this comment section, just not what I thought I’d see I canât speak for anyone else, but I know Iâve thrown a lot of negativity his way and for practically his entire time here. But what are we supposed to do? Heâs not very good. I have given him respect for becoming a pretty good shooter and I think the Warriors can use that for the time being. But heâs not a rotation guy on a playoff team. He really isnât. Is that hating? I think itâs an analysis of his game. How can you literally hate someone who works hard, does what heâs asked, is a fantastic teammate, and is a good kid? I donât think thatâs possible lol Please login to leave a reply.

The injury, which Niang suffered during offseason training and conditioning, was announced on September 27. At that time, the Jazz said that Niang would be reevaluated in two weeks. The newest update confirms that he is progressing in his rehabilitation, but there is still no definitive return date. Niang’s return to Utah this summer came in the form of a trade by the Celtics aimed at freeing up cap space, as he was dealt along with two second-round picks for rookie RJ Luis . Niang split last season between the Hawks and Cavaliers, and held season averages of 9.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game. The career 39.9% three-point shooter played four seasons with Utah from 2017-21 and appeared in 23 playoff games for the team, averaging 5.0 points in 13.0 minutes. The Jazz, in the midst of a rebuild, reportedly value Niang for the impact he could have as a veteran among the many young players on their roster. That’s it, JAZZ have to tank this season.

One idea they’ve pushed in the preseason, according to Hunter Patterson of The Athletic , is giving third-year wing Ausar Thompson more primary ball-handling duties. While Thompson’s ball-in-hand role last season was mostly limited to fastbreaks and dunks off drop-offs, the Pistons are expanding his role in the lead-up to this season to see how he handles it, Patterson writes. “ Thatâs something weâre going to do more of ,” head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “ The tempo that [Thompson] plays at when he has the ball in his hands, and the threat that he becomes when he has the ball in his hands changes the way that teams have to guard him. He has the ability to make his teammates better .” Patterson points to Thompson’s ability to change speeds and use both his strength and quick-twitch athleticism to get to the rim or beat defenders as key reasons why giving him the ball more is intriguing. Bickerstaff is also interested in exploring different ways to free up Cunningham off-ball to get him easier looks. “ Teams decide they want to pick Cade up full court, and sometimes because of the gravity he holds, people just hug up on him ,” Bickerstaff said. “ Now his defender has to play off a screen or off a shift, and it just makes him a better offensive player when people canât get their hands on him to wrestle and hold him .” While Thompson still has to tighten his handle, the team has seen encouraging signs. “ Ausar is a guy who can initiate offense at a high level ,” Cunningham said. “ Giving him room to get more and more comfortable with it as the preseason goes along, I think thatâll be a big weapon for us .” We have more notes from the Pistons: Cade and the undersized Pistons Seems this writer for the Athletic. Doesnât know who Jaden Ivey is. Cause he is the other guard on this team. And more than capable of doing all the things. He claims they are teaching Thompson. Ivey is a big addition this year. He is a playmaker with a good handle. Who is capable of putting up 20 a night. I would start Thompson at SG and play Ivey as your super sixth man I sort of donât mind that Ivey is being overlooked right now. It might be a slow start for him, coming back from a broken leg, but watch for him to be a featured guy in those articles in the second half of the season. Please login to leave a reply.

Murray, who injured his thumb late in the second quarter of Friday’s preseason game vs. Portland, will undergo surgery to address the tear and will be reevaluated in four-to-six weeks, according to the Kings. It’s unfortunate timing for Murray, who is eligible to sign a rookie scale extension between now and October 20. While his injury likely won’t impact the Kings’ long-term view of him or significantly impact those negotiations, the 25-year-old won’t have the opportunity to make a final case for a new deal on the court this week in the team’s two remaining preseason games. The fourth overall pick in the 2022 draft, Murray had a promising rookie season in which he averaged 12.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, shot 41.1% from beyond the three-point line, and finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting as he started 78 games for Sacramento. The 6’8″ forward has remained a starter for the Kings in the two years since then and has improved as a defender, but hasn’t taken a step forward offensively. In 2024/25, he averaged 12.4 PPG on .444/.343/.833 shooting while playing a career-high 34.3 minutes per night. If Murray, who is earning roughly $11.1MM this season, doesn’t sign a rookie scale extension by next Monday, he’ll be on track for free agency during the summer of 2026. The Kings would have to tender him a qualifying offer worth approximately $14.7MM to make him a restricted free agent at that time. It’s unclear who will take Murray’s spot in the starting five while he recovers, but forward Nique Clifford started the second half in his place on Friday alongside Dennis SchrÃ¶der , Zach LaVine , DeMar DeRozan , and Domantas Sabonis . Dario Saric and Doug McDermott are among the team’s other options at forward — if head coach Doug Christie wants to roll with a guard-heavy lineup, he could make Malik Monk or Keon Ellis a starter. Poor Kings fans. My sincere best wishes for a full recovery. This isnt his fault, but I feel like Murray has been very disappointing after his rookie season He’s gotten much better defensively and with rebounding, but his offense has taken a hit. Offense took a dip because the worst run franchise in the NBA wanted to be the Sacramento Bulls and run the same team the bulls had. Levine is a 3rd Star making 1star money. DeMar DeRozan is cooked and should be a bench scorer. And sabonis is a PF playing center. He was already an older rookie so the development was limited. He seems pretty one dimensional and lacks the attacking to rim moves. Defense is okay. Although this is a bit of a hit for the kings, it’s early in the season so it allows Christie to give other guys more time. Let’s see if Saric can slide into a starting role and be consistent. Also it’s a great opportunity for Christie to experiment with mall ball lineups with Monk playing with the starters. I think they would use Ellis over Monk in a small ball starting lineup. You can’t have Monk, Demar, and Lavine all at once due to no defense and they all want shots. He’s gotta be faking it, according to you. How so? Or is this just another one of your delusions?

According to Sam Yip of HoopsHype , Oladipo’s plan is to evaluate his options and potential next steps once the preseason is over. Oladipo held his own against NBA players in Guangzhou’s first two games on Monday and Thursday, registering 20 points and five steals in 29 minutes vs. San Antonio, then putting up 24 points and five assists in 27 minutes against the Clippers. However, the 33-year-old guard tells Yip that nothing came of a July workout in Las Vegas in front of NBA teams. “People show interest, but again, with the new CBA, with contracts and stuff, people can only do so much,” Oladipo said. “So time will tell when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll be ready for it.” Representatives from European teams also reportedly attended Oladipo’s workout in Las Vegas, and while he didn’t rule out the possibility of playing overseas, the former No. 2 overall pick suggested he’s not seriously entertaining that idea at the moment. “You know, if push comes to shove and that’s the last option, we’ll see. I’m definitely one of the best. So that’s where I belong is the three letters: N-B-A,” he told Yip with a laugh.

Throughout the offseason, Westbrook has been repeatedly linked to the Kings , and ESPN’s Shams Charania reported on Friday that the two sides continue to have “strong mutual interest” ( Twitter video link ). “ Iâm told there is strong mutual interest between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings ,” Charania said (hat tip to Kurt Helin of NBC Sports ). “ And the Kings have a need for a reserve point guard. They were 29th in bench points, 29th in bench assists last season. Russell Westbrook helps with that, and heâs got relationships across that organization. “ Domantas Sabonis , heâs close with, played with him. He played with Dennis SchrÃ¶der as well. DeMar DeRozan , Zach LaVine , they have L.A. ties as well. BJ Armstrong , the new assistant general manager there. He knows BJ Armstrong from the agency side, and he does have respect with Scott Perry , their new general manager, and Doug Christie , their new head coach. “ Weâll see if a deal gets done before the start of the season or during this upcoming year .” Carmichael Dave of SactownSports.com ( Twitter link ) posits that there’s about a 70 percent chance that Westbrook will sign with Sacramento at some point, assuming the two sides can figure out the financials. The plugged-in radio host also hears Westbrook has a lucrative contract offer on the table to play in China, but the former NBA MVP likely wouldn’t go that route until after the All-Star game, which is in his hometown of Los Angeles. The Kings currently only have 13 players on guaranteed standard contracts, plus Keon Ellis on a non-guaranteed deal and Terence Davis on a training camp pact. Westbrook, 36, played a significant role for the Nuggets after signing with Denver as a free agent during the 2024 offseason. He averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals in 27.9 minutes per game across 75 appearances (36 starts) during the regular season, with a .449/.323/.661 shooting line. He also contributed 11.7 PPG, 2.6 APG, and 3.7 RPG in 13 playoff contests (24.1 MPG). That would be a great pick up for the kings. Push the ball, hit the wings and clean up the trail At the least, he’d add some competitive fire to a team badly in need of it. Arrow down for last year’s lottery pick, Devin Carter. He’d be the third-string PG. 4th Elis is combo guard, can play pg, in fact they played best last season with him in lineup Sorry, I didnt understand, did you imply he would be behind Devin Carter in the depth chart? Schroder Westbrook Ellis Carter is what he’s implying yes Interesting, I dont see Devin Carter being that good but tbh I havent paid that much attention to him. Wouldn’t they still be trying to trade Carter since they were trying to in order to make room for Russ? I wish the Heat would sign him. Westbrook is a heck of an athlete. Hard to imagine he is considering playing in China even with big money in playð° Stick a fork in this bum At this point, I think Russ is interested in any team lol I wonder how much he gets. IMO, an upgrade over Shamet or Brogdon. I guess he didn’t want to come to New York I love the Knicks I like Westbrook I do not want Westbrook on this Knicks team. Rockets should be doing all they can to sign Westbrook. He can help hold it down. Till Rockets are able to make a trade (Dec 15). Then he just adds to their depth. Westbrook fits the Kings. He and Schroder make a good combo at PG. Russ is fun to watch due to the high effort he plays with. If he was on the Kings they would play fast but not going to stop many opponents. He would have to play with some form of Lavine and Monk. I don’t think Demar will run every time. Please login to leave a reply.

Terry’s camp has not had any “serious discussions” with the Bulls about a new deal, according to Cowley. Terry will remain eligible for a rookie scale extension until October 20 . The 23-year-old is entering the final year of his contract, which will pay him about $5.4MM in ’25/26. The Bulls could make Terry a restricted free agent next summer if they tender him a qualifying offer, though that seems far from certain given the way his first three seasons have played out. A 6’7″ swingman who was selected 18th overall in the 2022 draft after two college seasons at Arizona, Terry has struggled to establish himself as a reliable rotation player to this point in his career. He appeared in a career-high 73 games last season, holding relatively modest averages of 4.5 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 13.5 minutes per contest. Terry, who switched jersey numbers (from No. 25 to No. 7) as he looks for a fresh start this fall, readily acknowledges ’25/26 is a “big year” for his career. He tells Cowley he’s looking to one of his former teammates for inspiration. “ This is how I think everybody views it ,” Terry said. “ They view it as Iâm not a guy that scores 20, 30 points. Well, I got drafted to be like [former Bulls guard] Alex Caruso : ‘OK, he can guard, he can do all the little things, he can be a connector.’ Thatâs what I strive to be this year. “ Like, even [in the Bullsâ preseason victory Thursday against the Cavaliers], in my eyes, I played like [expletive]. But you look at the box score, and Iâm guarding Donovan Mitchell . I was tough on him. Guarding De’Andre Hunter . I was tough on him. I have to live like that, you know? “ I remember being in the locker room [when] AC was still here, and some days he would have six points and some days he would have 20 points. Thatâs just the way itâs going to be. I have to hang my hat on the defensive end. So when people try to put pressure on what I should be, Iâm just going to be myself .” “Be a connector” dude will be on the Warriors so fast I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for that QO but we are talking about the Bulls here.

However, the 6’11” forward/center sustained a torn tendon in his left foot in May, an injury that was expected to sideline him for three months, and he wound up going undrafted. Lakhin, who ranked third on ESPN’s list of 2025 prospects among players who weren’t drafted, played three college seasons at Cincinnati prior to transferring to Clemson for his senior year. In 34 games for the Tigers in 2024/25, the Russian big man averaged 11.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.0 steal and 1.5 blocks in 23.6 minutes per contest, with a shooting line of .507/.375/.696. While the terms of the contract were not disclosed, it’s safe to assume Oklahoma City signed Lakhin to a non-guaranteed Exhibit 10 deal. If he’s waived before the season begins and spends at least 60 days with the G League’s OKC Blue, Lakhin could earn a bonus worth up to $85,300. Exhibit 10 contracts can also be converted to two-way deals, and the Thunder do have a two-way opening. A promotion for Lakhin seems unlikely given the timing of the signing, but it’s technically still a possibility. The Thunder are now back at the offseason limit of 21 players under contract.

While a deal is expected to be completed, it has not yet been finalized, and a 76ers source tells Pompey the Trail Blazers are “still involved.” Beauchamp signed an Exhibit 10 deal with Portland on September 30 prior to being waived on Oct. 7, lining him up to join the Blazers’ G League affiliate, the Rip City Remix. If he were to be signed and waived by the Sixers, Portland could still have first dibs on naming Beauchamp an affiliate player, but it sounds like his camp is trying to steer him to the Delaware Blue Coats instead. Beauchamp, who turns 25 years old today (happy birthday), was the 24th overall pick of the 2022 draft. He spent his first two-and-a-half years with the Bucks, the team that drafted him, prior to being dealt to the Clippers ahead of the February trade deadline. He finished 2024/25 on a two-way contract with the Knicks after being cut by Los Angeles.

Assuming Beauchamp finalizes his Exhibit 10 deal with Philadelphia and is waived before the season begins, he would be eligible for a bonus worth up to $85,300 if he joins the Blue Coats and spends at least 60 days with the club. Exhibit 10 contracts can also be converted into two-way deals, though the 76ers do not currently have a two-way opening.

After going with a small-ball approach in the preseason opener while bringing Al Horford off the bench in his Golden State debut, Kerr made Horford a starter against the Trail Blazers along with Stephen Curry , Moses Moody , Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green . âThat could be a really powerful combo,â Kerr said. âI didnât have a great sense of it after the game because I was thinking so much of our turnovers and our lack of focus at times during the first half. But looking at the tape, it was a lot better than I expected for those first seven minutes or so.â Kerr likes having more size on the court to start the game, especially with Horford, who shoots well enough from three-point range to give everyone else plenty of room to operate. The group only played together for a little more than half of the first quarter before Kerr began making substitutions, and the veterans rested in the second half. âYou can tell with all the different lineups, we know that thereâs still going to be a lot to work on in terms of the chemistry and just the certain combinations,â Curry said. âThatâs part of the journey of training camp. But I just like the vibe and the intentionality that weâre all coming with, understanding that we need to get off to a good start. And trying to make that happen.â There’s more on the Warriors: Start Heild not Moody Interesting. So yes, I think the starting lineup should be Curry Moody Butler Green Horford. Sounds like when things are right thatâs the best starting 5. Perhaps this has been suggested the last month or so? I donât know.., maybe? ari, easymoneyrider, peter contrope, nba is ok, davey j ..,? You gentlemen certainly have an opinion here? I agree with that starting 5, but I am hoping we can see at least a few minutes of what Curry Butler Green Kuminga Horford looks like. Moody canât start. He has no handle lol â¦.. Donât think heâd get much chances to handle anyways with Green facilitating a lot of the offence, Curry the go to guy and then Butler as your secondary scoring option and what third ball handler? It would be more of a catch and shoot role and be good defensively Handle means able to take your defender off the dribble. Handle means able to bring the ball up. Handle means able to push the ball. Handle means able to handle ball pressure. Handle means able to make decisions while handling ball. Handle means making decisions with ball pressure against good D. Green nor Horford are guards. Neither has a good handle. Moody is more a wing and doesnât have a good handle. His decision making I donât really know. Jimmy is not a guard. He is more a SF that can be considered a wing. Jimmy can handle the ball and make decisions. But you donât want him to be the only one. Curry is usually the one who ends up with ball. He can handle the ball and make decisions. Except his main job is to score. Curry is not a PG. He actually plays more like a wing. Cause Warriors use him so much off the ball. Kuminga has a handle. But his decision making is not there yet nor is his shot. He is best now off the bench. Warriors offense is built for playmakers and shooters. Playmaker always has a handle. Looks like Kerr has decided that’s his starting lineup. Moody’s already hurt, so it could turn out to be Podz at the 2 Good, lets see what Podz can do here. I like the idea of Al shooting and Podz rebounding. Podz is a Russell Westbrook-type guy, and as GP2 proved, those types DO have a role in Kerr’s rotations, and often succeed when paired with Steph. It’s a more chaotic element that this slow, old team will need to deploy when the other team finds a rhythm on both sides. One thing I think is imperative for this upcoming games is to try and get a non-oldies rotation to gel and be reliable in case of injury/days off for being old. To get through the whole season with the oldies ready for the playoffs, the younger guys must step up and more importantly, be able to gel with whatever oldies are active and more importantly with each other. Post Kuminga Moody Hield Podz is one rotation I’d love to see Post TJD Kuminga Moody Podz is another Santos and Buddy also are two more who need to step up. Oddly, Buddy is officially “everyday Buddy” who never misses a game, so he can be counted on being there as much as anyone can be. What a remarkable run of health, how does he do it? What he does need to be is more consistent. Now is his time to step up and show he’s still the guy he was on the Pacers, if he does, GSW is in tremendous shape. Santos is in a make or break year too. Need all these guys at their best this year, but aside from Kuminga, who still is in his head too much, I like all their chances. Kerr is the best coach in the league and will figure it out. Maybe Kuminga will play more if he actually gives it full effort. Moody starting? Damn this team is already imploding and the season hasn’t even started yet He would be the SG. He is shooting great. What is your complaint? He sucks at shooting So far as a starter in the 2 preseason games, he’s shot 11-21 (52.3%) overall and 7-12 from three (58.3%). Certainly above average! This is just like your claim that Curry is getting divorced because of something that happened over 15 years ago. He didn’t suck at shooting last season. Yes he did In the 60 games before the injury, he shot 45%/39%/78% avging 10 ppg, and the Warriors were 36-24 in those games. Big D is just a warrior hater so itâs a bias opinion. Obviously. I’m curious, what happened to your arc89 profile? Somebody must hate me because it will not allow me to Post. I think I know who it is a laker fan that posted political stuff on here. Unfortunately this site just deletes profiles instead of looking into it. I am Jimmy Kimmel. Lol Incorrect, I’m purely an objective observer, as I have already proven when you were liking my pro warriors comments. Now that the objectivity doesn’t go your way, you now only dislike my comments. That is peak example of being boas 1. Just wrong. 2. The “injury” never happened. Which is why the April, after the alleged injury, was his 3rd highest shooting month of the year. Try again 1. The stats from those 60 games before the game he was injured in are facts. 2. Players don’t get surgery for nonexistent injuries. The playoffs, where he shot 35% overall/33% from three were in April. LMAO! The surgery was in May because the injury was in May. Those are not facts you’re reading the wrong information. The alleged injury happened March. In February he shot 35%. In April he shot 37%. Try again, and this time at least make it make sense. lMaO He shot 48%/41% in March before the injury. Prove me wrong. Wrong. Proved. So, you have no source for your shooting stats? I do Are you saying he faked the injury and never had surgery?? No In the 10 games he played in February, he shot 47%. (game log linked). Why do you lie so much? link to basketball-reference.com In the 10 games he played in February, he shot 35%. (Game log linked). Why do you lie so much? link to basketball-reference.com So are you blind, or just stupid? As your posting the same link I did conclusively proves, he shot 47% overall and 36% from three pt range, and 83% from the ft line. So are you blind or just stupid? As your posting the same link I did conclusively proves, he shot 35% from three pt range So which is it? 1. You claimed he shot 35% in February, when he actually shot 47%. Since you didn’t refer to a subset of where shots were taken from, you were off by 12%. 2. FYI, according to established mathematical convention for rounding fractions of a percent, 35.8% rounds up to 36%, not down to 35%, for obvious reasons (if not stupid, ofc). Prove that he is lying about his surgery. Cite your source for his monthly shooting stats. Prove that he’s telling the truth about his surgery. You are the one making the allegation that he never had surgery on his thumb. It is up to you to back up your claim. So, backup your claim. No I’m not, you said he had surgery first. I didn’t bring it up, you did, therefore it’s your allegation. It is up to you to prove the allegation, So back up your claim. You said Moody lied about having surgery. You need to prove he lied. I did not say that. That’s just another delusion of yours So proud of Moody. A year ago, most of the fans here wanted him gone and thought he was only worthy of less than half of his contract. Heâs playing with more confidence now, less hesitant, and making quicker decisions. He knows he belongs now. Kudos to Moody who also deserved more playing earlier in his career. Yea players tend to play with confidence in the preseason. He should be preseason mvp He shot well last year â¦. my critique is his handle. .374% 3pt, .519% 2pt, .80% FT â¦.. his 2pt shooting was down last year. .520% is still considered good shooting. 37% is pretty weak if your only job is to be a shooter. Should be hovering around 40% especially when you’re playing with Curry NBA considers 34% 3pt shooting respectable. And good. Cause of the analytics. And if you bothered to look at his stats you would know. He shot .425% 3pt in college and had a career high. In mins 22 mins and 3pt shooting last year .374% . For a 23 yr old. Only THREE players shot over 40% 3pt shooting in 2024-25 nba season. OK and if Moddys .374% would count he would be the #5 on the list. I think you need to research what 3pt shooting actually means. link to google.com link to basketball-reference.com Research? Have you ever even touched a basketball? And wtf college got to do with the nba? It’s not even the same distance. And you want to talk about research? Haha gtfo and go touch some grass This game is a test for Post. Can he play enough defense to show his value. He will be going against Ayton who is a lob shooter so Post must keep him from getting inside positioning. Post will learn from Horford. His defense and rebounding must be better. Both he and TJD should learn a lot from Horford. Please login to leave a reply. Log in Register Username or Email Address Password Remember Me Register"}

There’s more from Los Angeles: Here is my Lakers roster notes/player quick review (I left out the rookies because too much volatility, too hard to predict): Luka: elite top 5, MVP contender, we all know he’s in his prime too Lebron: very old and very injured. He’s at the point where something like a back injury could end his career. Very low chance of being a meaningful player this season Reaves: maybe the best 2way sign of all-time. Underrated and extremely good Hachimura: the definition of mid. Not a “good” player in this league.

Stats back it up Smart: another massively overrated player. At no point did he ever clear Draymond defensively. The worst, most undeserving DPOY ever. He is a PG for crying out loud. Even in his prime he was barely good. Also made of glass. Glad he isn’t on my team LaRavia: had a decent season last year averaging 20 MPG. Nice buy low option. If he keeps ascending, Lakers might have got a bargain, but he is no sure bet to keep improving, huge year for him tbh Vanderbilt: another absolutely terrible player. Lakers having multiple “worst in the league” contenders on the same roster speaks volumes on their ceiling Hayes: not a terrible role player, but can he be trusted with over 20 MPG? Still developing, I will reserve judgement as he is a breakout candidate Bronny: cmon. “Euro league bench player wins NBA job due to father”. We all know the deal here. Moving on… Knecht: another development piece. Played much worse after trade rumors. Still has a decent ceiling to be a regular rotation piece James sitting out will be a great opportunity for Rui, Vando and LaRavia getting more minutes and more shots. Even Knecht might get some playing time with LeBron out. Hopefully, Bron comes back healthy in a month or two, and the Nove mentioned players will have built up some confidence, which will bode well for the Lakers in the playoffs. What team does better next season, GSW or Lakers? Both are old and seemingly on their last legs on being considered contenders but both donât exactly have strong enough rosters in comparison to some of the other teams in the league. Luka Bron Reaves with help from Smart Vando Rui Ayton or Curry Butler Green with help from Kuminga Heild Horford and what not They both finish with win totals in the high forties and their playoff fates will be hugely health reliant. If either one makes it out of the West it will be because they stayed healthy while other teams suffered key injuries. I wonât be shocked if Curry or LeBron add to their ring totals this yearâ¦and in that coin toss I will pick the Warriors I donât see either team having a chance at winning a chip unless there is a trade or two. Warriors could do that with Kuminga but until that happens then I donât rate their chances. As for the Lakers, I think they have many issues, mainly a lack of defence. Luka Reaves Bron and Ayton donât offer much and when you then have Smart and Vando in there for their defence they offer nothing on offence. They need more two way guys and better cohesion. Rui gets a lot of smack from people but he plays his role perfectly. Over 50% from the field and over 40% on 3, does well on defence and can play either forward spot. “Both are old and seemingly on their last legs of being considered contenders” GSW are old. LAL are not. Other than LeBron, they have only 2 players older than 30 – Smart and Kleber. In a potential Doncic, Reaves, Hachimura, Ayton, Vanderbilt line-up, the oldest player is 27. That line-up has the same average age as Strus, Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, Mobley, Garland team. Carmelo, Russ, Dwight, Rondo, Ariza, DeAndre Jordan are not in Los Angeles anymore. That team was old in 2022. 25-26 Lakers are not. If Lakers meets the Warriors, i’d favor the Lakers. Luka is only 26 and is now in basketball shape. Warriors does not have the length that the wolves have. It will be a challenge for them to contain him like the wolves did. The Lakers are the 6 th youngest team outside of Lebron , 11th if you count him They have 1 player other than lebron over 30 Smart (31) that will see the floor for more than double digit mins per game this year Itâs not even a lazy take itâs just flat out incorrect . You didnât think this one out very well Not a good sign to load manage Luka already. Maybe an injury prone player shouldn’t beat himself up just weeks before the NBA season. The best thing the Lakers can do is trade Lebron. They won’t, but they need to. Smart, Luka, Reaves, Rui and Ayton could be a good lineup if everyone is running the floor. LeBron has a no-trade clause. It’s one of the reasons he was always signing 1+1 with a player option. He’s not approving any trade. He wants to have a never-traded label. Well they messed that up big time Peter, he wants to have a ânever tradedâ label until it comes to money. To get money from his desired team, he had to be traded there. He could not just sign with the Heat outright. It wouldâve hurt his wallet so I guess he didnât want the never traded label that bad. Itâs like everyone talking about Jonathan Kumingaâs recent âprinciples.â While his principles meant taking 8 million, but taking the money meant 50 million. Jebron Lames!
