Smith he hasn't ruled out playing this season and has spoken to Tyrese Haliburton about them both suffering with an Achilles injury. (2:22) THERE ARE THREE new banners hanging above the main court inside the Indiana Paces training facility, across the street from the team's arena, Gainbridge Fieldhouse. On one end there are retired jersey numbers, Reggie Miller's 31 and Mel Daniels' 34, and a banner each for Herb Simon, the team's governor since 1983 who was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, as well as Jim Morris, a pivotal member of the Indianapolis community who held leadership roles in the organization up until his passing in 2024. On the other end, a new banner for the 2024-25 Eastern Conference championship quietly hangs. It went up last week -- a few days after the team had already begun training camp -- without a collective acknowledgement from the players and coaches as they prepare for the upcoming season. \"It was not here one day, up here the next,\" Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith told ESPN. The Pacers do plan to commemorate the banner at the arena before their regular season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 23, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said there's no plans to dwell on it for long. \"There's not going to be a big thing about it,\" Carlisle told ESPN after practice last week. \"It was a great run and really a lot of amazing things happened during that stretch. But you got to turn the page.\" Such was the vibe at Pacers training camp, a team still fresh off the glow of one of the most improbable playoff runs to the Finals in NBA history, while also wrestling with the disappointment of coming up short in Game 7 and the consequences of a season-changing injury to Tyrese Haliburton in the first quarter of that game. Haliburton's torn Achilles was the latest such injury during the playoffs that has altered the trajectory of the 2025-26 Eastern Conference. The last two Eastern Conference champions will be missing their star player for most of, if not, all of the season after Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles in the conference semifinals. Boston had been to the conference finals in three consecutive seasons, and in four of the past five seasons. Meanwhile, Indiana had made back-to-back conference finals runs and appeared set up as well as anyone in the league to return with its young core and playoff experience. It sets up both Boston and Indiana to endure an entire season with their star players almost certainly unavailable -- the Pacers have ruled Haliburton out for the season although the Celtics have not done the same for Tatum -- but also with much lower expectations than usual for the two teams who have controlled the East in recent years. \"I think it's exciting,\" Celtics guard Derrick White told ESPN. \"We're not the hunted anymore. But just have that mindset of 'We're going to prove people wrong' and compete at a high level.\" In addition to losing their stars, both teams also lost other key pieces of their roster. The Celtics traded away Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and lost Al Horford and Luke Kornet in free agency. The Pacers lost center Myles Turner in free agency after the Milwaukee Bucks made their own move in response to a torn Achilles, waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his contract over the next five years after he was injured during the first round of the postseason. It sets up a potentially wide-open Eastern Conference field where several teams believe they have a chance to make the Finals, especially after seeing the run Indiana made last year. \"You got to focus on what you have and not what you don't have,\" Carlisle told ESPN. \"We want to develop and maximize.\" \"One of the things I'm most proud of the last two years is the development [of our young players]. We're going to be looking to do the same thing. We got guys that still have upside, and we want them to realize that upside. And we want to maximize what we can with wins and losses.\" Winning may be the intention of both teams coming into the season, but the projections are not optimistic about their chances even in a weakened conference. According to ESPN BET , the Celtics currently have the seventh best odds to win the East, just behind teams such as Detroit and Philadelphia, while Indiana has the ninth best odds. Yet, neither the Celtics or the Pacers have intention of tanking to try and get the best draft pick possible, sources told ESPN, or taking a gap in their contention. Their goal will be to win as many games as possible, remain competitive and hope different players flourish in their new roles. \"That's not going to be part of the lexicon [on rebuilding] in our building, and that's the way we're going to focus moving forward,\" Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens said this summer. The mindset is the same for last year's Eastern Conference champion. \"There's been no internal talk about that,\" Carlisle said about taking a gap year. \"We want to compete at the highest level that we can.\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum explains why there is no pressure to return quicker from his Achilles injury. THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE that have walked into their first NBA head coaching job quite like how Joe Mazzulla did. When Mazzulla replaced Ime Udoka as Celtics head coach on the eve of training camp three years ago, Mazzulla became the youngest coach in the league at 34 years old. He swiftly rose from a Division II head coach three years prior to running a group that has spent each of the past three seasons as one of the favorites to win the title. And as he's thrived in his position, Mazzulla has become defined by his intensity. His pre- and postgame interviews have gone viral, at times, for Mazzulla's focused intensity and dry, sometimes unintentional, humor . Last year, when he was asked how the Celtics planned to embrace being the defending champion, Mazzulla responded \"People are going to say the target is on our back, but I hope it's right on our forehead between our eyes.\" Even if outside expectations have changed around the Celtics, it hasn't dimmed that intensity at all. \"The same thing excites me every year,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"I get excited about, 'OK, where are we as far as the trends of the league? Where are we as far as what we've put in up until this point? Does it really maximize the roster that we have? Does it maximize the mindset that we have? Are we truly taking advantage of the strengths that we have?\" Under Mazzulla, the Celtics have been known for an intense dedication to getting up as many 3-pointers as possible. Boston has led the league in 3-point attempts in each of the past two years and ranked second in his first season as coach, a 3-point barrage that has become dubbed Mazzulla ball. However, Mazzulla pushed back on that title over the weekend -- \"I don't pay too much attention to that,\" he told reporters -- and he has said his belief in playing that way over the past three years was driven by his roster construction. This year's team doesn't appear to have that same wealth of options. Rather than stick to one overriding philosophy and making his players fit into it, Mazzulla said his goal was to figure out how to maximize the talent that's in front of him on his roster -- the same mindset Carlisle was planning nearly a thousand miles away. \"I may have to coach completely differently than the year before,\" Mazzulla told ESPN. \"In years past, you had an older, more experienced roster, four or five All-Stars on the team together. So your process is different.\" With a scoring void on the roster, it could present an opportunity for White to step into an even bigger role. Already regarded around the league as one of the best two-way guards, White is in position to emerge as the clear second option on the roster behind Jaylen Brown on offense. But White has made his career out of conforming to whatever role the team needs him to play and he said going into the season focusing on trying to become a go-to scorer, it'll take away from what made him the player the Celtics gave a four-year extension, $126 million extension last year. \"I know that if I focus on, 'I need to score 25 points' or something, I know I won't play well,\" White said. \"If I just do what I do and play within the offense and do it, I might get 25 points a night, who knows? And so my goal is not, 'Oh, JT is out, I can do more.' I still got to just be who I am and just do things I can to help us win games.\" Both Mazzulla and White pointed to the Pacers as a model for how an undertalented, but hard-playing, Boston team can find ways to win games. Indiana provided the blueprint last season and particularly, in the playoffs, when they wore down opponents with a relentless playstyle, covering 94 feet of the court and for all 48 minutes of every game. \"It's a copycat league, and you see success with it and now everybody tries to do it their own way,\" White said. \"You're probably going to see that a lot around the league, and you've definitely seen like last year -- the pressure. Everybody's trying to pick up full and these teams are trying to just create turnovers.\" The Pacers have grown used to hearing that sentiment all summer. Nesmith spent most of his offseason near Austin, Texas and while at baggage claim after the season ended, he had several fans remark about how the Pacers style of play inspired them. \"I've had a lot of people come up to me this summer and just say, \"You made me a fan of NBA basketball again,'\" Nesmith told ESPN. The word Carlisle said he's heard associated with the Pacers frequently throughout the summer: inspirational. \"Really it's a credit to the players,\" Carlisle said. \"You got to have special guys that are willing to pick up full court. ... that was cool to be a part of that.\" It's why despite missing a few key players from last year, the principles of the Pacers offense and system are unlikely to change. Carlisle said Bennedict Mathurin will enter the starting lineup and Andrew Nembhard will take on more of the primary ball handling duties. While Indiana plans to lean into some of Nembhard's strengths, such as playing downhill instead of as much high pick-and-roll as Haliburton, the Pacers are sticking to their principles. \"We're doing the same things,\" Nembhard said. \"We're still trying to push the pace, play randomly. A lot of different guys touching the ball. A lot of different actions.\" However, the Pacers are going to be walking a tightrope of leaning into that style of play while knowing the league is going to be more prepared for it than in the past few seasons. \"When you disrupt the industry the way we did, it's going to disrupt back,\" Carlisle said. \"And so we got to be ready for that. More teams are going to be more physical and so we've got to be ready to bring it up another notch.\" HALIBURTON STOOD UNDERNEATH a basket, wearing a grey hoodie with grey shorts, as he waited for a rebound. Two players at the end of the roster, Johnny Furphy and Taelon Peter , were engaged in a shooting competition at the end of practice with Peter getting ready to shoot around the 3-point line. Furphy has set the target score, and Peter is trying to match. But in addition to rebounding, Haliburton keeps providing more fuel to the fire. \" Ooooh ,\" he eggs Peter on with each shot. \"Don't let him beat you.\" When Peter misses, Haliburton fires a pass back at him: \"Don't miss. You got two more.\" Peter accepts the challenge and knocks down five in a row to win the competition. Even if he is sidelined from playing in games for the entire season, Haliburton still plans to be a regular presence around the team both at home and on the road. \"We'll hear his voice,\" Carlisle said with a smile. \"He's always going to have great energy. One thing about Ty, he has a consistent, positive spirit about life. He just loves it. He's an early riser. He's here before anybody in the morning. He's tackled this rehab thing like a beast. It'll be important to have him be a part of this every day.\" Haliburton was walking without the aid of a brace or crutches and proclaimed with a smile that he's back to driving a car again. But Indiana has already targeted opening night 2026 for the breakout star of last year's postseason. Tatum, meanwhile, has closed no such doors on a potential return this season. Five months after his injury, he's resumed light basketball activities, including a workout video before the start of camp that helped grease the speculation of whether he could play at some point during the 2025-26 season -- though no definitive timelines have been laid out by either Tatum, or the team, for his return. \"No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy,\" Tatum said at Celtics media day. \"No pressure from Brad, Joe, the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I do come back.\" That last point by Tatum is what makes this season all the more strange for both Boston and Indiana. For both teams, the most important thing that will happen this season won't be on the court -- instead, it'll be the respective recovery processes for each team's injured star, and with it the potential for brighter days in the future. But rather than allow that to turn this season into a time-wasting exercise, the Celtics and Pacers are using it as motivation, in their own way, to try to make this a special year anyway. \"It doesn't really matter what people believe or what they say,\" Nesmith told ESPN. \"They haven't believed in us in three years. We surprise them every single year. I don't see what makes this year any different.\""}

(1:27) EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James , who has yet to participate in training camp, will be sidelined an additional three to four weeks because of sciatica on his right side, the team announced Thursday. James, 40, missed the Lakers' first two preseason games and has yet to participate in a full practice because of what coach JJ Redick described as nerve irritation in his glute. Sciatica describes the symptoms of irritation, inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, according to ESPN injury analyst Stephania Bell. The nerve originates in the lumbar (lower) spine and travels down through the gluteal muscles and the hamstrings before branching into other smaller nerves in the lower leg and foot. Symptoms can range from pain that can be sharp or burning to numbness and tingling or pins and needles. Resolution time varies widely and depends on the source of the problem. When asked Thursday for an update on James' progress with the injury, before the Lakers released the sciatica diagnosis, Redick said James was \"on his own timeline.\" Should James continue to be sidelined for the full three to four weeks, he would miss the Lakers' opening-night game against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. ESPN's Shams Charania reported this week that James would likely miss the entire preseason but had been targeting opening night for his return to game action. James is embarking on a record-setting 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. Since James joined the Lakers in 2018-19, Los Angeles is 248-171 (a .591 winning percentage) with him on the court. When he does not play, they are 56-78 (.418)."}

California Highway Patrol officers responded at about 10:40 p.m. to an unrelated car crash involving multiple vehicles on the northbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101, closing four of the six lanes to investigate, the agency said in a news release. When they reopened the lanes about an hour later, they saw a Range Rover SUV stopped in the road, south of the crash. Officers saw Pierce asleep at the wheel and \"noticed signs of alcohol impairment,\" so they conducted a DUI investigation, the press release said. He was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, which will be reviewed by the Los Angeles city attorney. Pierce did not immediately respond to a message for comment, and additional contact information for him could not be immediately found. Pierce played for the Boston Celtics for 15 seasons, and most recently for LA Clippers before retiring in 2017. He also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards. The 10-time All-Star and the MVP of the 2008 NBA Finals was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.

Smith likes the Knicks' chances of making the NBA Finals this season and wants them to do whatever it takes to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. (0:50) The annual NBA.com survey of all 30 of the league's front offices has tapped the Oklahoma City Thunder to defend their title. Like in ESPN's annual offseason survey last month, the Thunder were runaway favorites to win the title, with 80% of general managers across the NBA picking OKC to win for a second straight year -- which, if the Thunder are able to do so, would mark the first time since the Golden State Warriors repeated in 2018 that a team would manage to repeat as champions. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets each got a couple of votes, while the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks each received a single selection. The annual survey -- which goes out to all 30 teams and doesn't allow teams to pick themselves or anyone from their own rosters, meaning no player or team can ever get better than 97% of the vote in a category -- also had Oklahoma City and Cleveland as the heavy favorites to win their respective conferences. Besides the Thunder -- who were first on 87% of ballots, and second on the remaining 10% -- the Nuggets received 10% of the first-place votes and the Rockets received a single one. They were followed, in order, by the Minnesota Timberwolves , Warriors, LA Clippers , Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs . In the East, Cleveland and New York both were unanimously selected to finish in the top three spots in the East, with the Cavaliers getting 63% of the votes for first place, 27% for second place and 7% for third. The Knicks, meanwhile, received 30%, 53% and 13%, respectively. The only other team to receive any first-place votes was the Orlando Magic , who received 7%. The Magic were also picked to finish third overall, followed by the Atlanta Hawks , Detroit Pistons , Milwaukee Bucks , Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics . Nuggets star Nikola Jokic , who has finished first or second in the last five MVP ballots, was the runaway pick to win this year's top individual honor, claiming 67% of the votes, while Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama received 83% of the votes as the player GMs would pick if they had a chance to select anyone to start a franchise, making him the winner in that category for the second straight season. Rockets forward Amen Thompson , meanwhile, received 30% of the votes in the \"most likely to have a breakout season\" category, which goes hand-in-hand with him being the current betting favorite to be this season's Most Improved Player. There was little debate over who the best player is at any position, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Anthony Edwards , Luka Doncic , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jokic claiming the honor at each position. The only one of the five positions to receive less than 70% of the vote for the top selection was small forward, where Doncic received 40%, followed by Jayson Tatum (20), Kevin Durant (17), LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard (7 each), with Jaylen Brown , Jimmy Butler and Jalen Williams each getting a single vote. In the offseason superlatives section, the Hawks (53%) were the top pick for having the best offseason, followed by the Rockets (27%) and Nuggets (10%). The Rockets trading for Kevin Durant , meanwhile, was picked as the offseason move that will have the biggest impact, while the Magic were both picked as the most improved team this season (47%) and having made the most underrated move by trading for guard Desmond Bane and the Thunder (83%) were tapped as the league's best defensive team. Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg , the No. 1 overall pick in June's NBA draft, was the massive favorite to win both Rookie of the Year and to be the best rookie from this class in five years, while Miami Heat guard Kasparas Jakucionis was the pick to be the biggest steal in this year's draft class. In the individual superlatives section, Wembanyama (80%) was picked as the league's best defensive player; Erik Spoelstra (52%) was picked as its best coach for the sixth straight season; Jokic (80%) was picked as the NBA's best passer and player with the highest basketball IQ, while Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama were tied, with 30% of the vote each, for the honor of being the league's most versatile player, and Stephen Curry was the winner, with 47% of the vote, for being the player you'd want to take a shot with the game on the line."}

(1:35) USA Basketball is expected to hire the Miami Heat 's Erik Spoelstra as the next head coach of the men's national team, sources told ESPN. Spoelstra succeeds Steve Kerr for the 2027 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics after serving as a lead assistant on Team USA's 2024 gold medal squad. This will be fourth straight Olympics that Team USA has a different coach: Mike Krzyzewski was the coach in 2016, followed by Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Team USA managing director Grant Hill decided upon Spoelstra. Hill has set an internal infrastructure for Team USA's coaching cycles: Kerr was a top assistant for Popovich before becoming head coach, and now Kerr will transfer the job to Spoelstra. Spoelstra is a two-time NBA champion as a head coach with the Heat, leading the franchise to six NBA Finals appearances. The longest tenured active head coach in the NBA, Spoelstra has the fifth-most playoff wins in NBA history and the most victories in Heat history. Team USA won the men's basketball gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, defeating France 98-87 in the final. It was Team USA's fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal and 17th overall. Team USA could feature considerable turnover from the team that won gold in Paris. Kevin Durant , the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history, hasn't ruled out playing one more time in 2028. Stephen Curry indicated that the Paris Games would be his one and only Olympic run, and LeBron James will be 43 when the Los Angeles Games are held. Miami's Bam Adebayo , Boston's Jayson Tatum , Dallas' Anthony Davis and Phoenix's Devin Booker , all previous gold medalists, would all likely have strong chances to play in 2028 if they'd like to wear the national team jersey again. There also will likely be some first-time selections for the Olympic team, with Orlando's Paolo Banchero , Detroit's Cade Cunningham , Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren and Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg sure to be among those under consideration. Previously, USA Basketball finalized an agreement to make Duke coach Kara Lawson the coach of the women's national team for the Olympic cycle through the Los Angeles Games.

I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go. It's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day by day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter. \"I've communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love, that the moment I step on this court or in this facility, I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I'm locked into whatever I have in front of me.

The Bucks next host the Pistons on Thursday in Milwaukee. \"I'm locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I'm locked in to this team. I'm locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.\" He went on to compare the offseason to a \"temptation\" period, but now that training camp has started, he's been off social media and focused on his craft. \"It's temptation. That starts when the season ends until the season begins,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be a lot of people that are going to approach me or approach my agent and they're going to say this is a possibility, that's a possibility ... but at the end of the day, ultimately, I'm going to make a decision.

(1:27) Which NBA teams might be better or worse than expected this season? My stats-based projections help answer that question. Last year, my model was high on the Cleveland Cavaliers (ranked second in the Eastern Conference) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (the highest overall projection) and appropriately liked the Brooklyn Nets and the Portland Trail Blazers to be more competitive than expected while putting the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns lower than conventional wisdom (but still not as poor as they actually finished, entirely out of the play-in tournament for both teams). Based on the scoring of projections at the APBRmetrics forum , my recalibrated forecast had the second-lowest root mean squared error, a method that heavily penalizes bad misses. It also had the strongest correlation to actual wins and losses. To project teams, I start with player ratings based on a combination of my SCHOENE stats-based projections and luck-adjusted regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) provided by Krishna Narsu that covers the past three seasons. For each team, I project games played based on those missed to injury over the past three years and current absences then subjectively guess at the distribution of playing time. The result is an expected wins total given average health, which is comparable to teams' over/under season win totals at ESPN BET . In addition to ranking each conference's teams 1 to 15, I've also tried to explain why my projections are higher or lower than those totals. Let's get to it, starting with the defending champions. Then we'll look into who could emerge in a wide-open Eastern Conference and who might plummet down in the standings this season. Jump to a team: ATL | BOS | BKN | CHA | CHI | CLE DAL | DEN | DET | GS | HOU | IND LAC | LAL | MEM | MIA | MIL | MIN NO | NY | OKC | ORL | PHI | PHX POR | SAC | SA | TOR | UTA | WAS 1. Oklahoma City Thunder Projected wins: 59.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 62.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Oklahoma City's line of 62.5 wins is appropriately monstrous. In fact, it's the highest since the 2017-18 NBA champion Warriors were pegged at 67.5 wins, before finishing with 58. If anyone is going to hit that line, it's the Thunder, who have the highest projection for any team in my model since ... the 2017-18 Warriors. 2. Golden State Warriors Projected wins: 56.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Warriors might have the single most surprising projection for any team, nearly four wins clear of the non-Oklahoma City field. Having added RAPM superstar Jimmy Butler III for a full season -- they won at a 63-win clip (76.7%) with Butler in the lineup last season -- the Warriors also have 11 players who rate better than league average, tied with the Thunder for most of any team. 3. Denver Nuggets Projected wins: 52.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: There's not much disagreement here on the Nuggets, who are third in the Western Conference either way. The win-plus differential could easily be explained by the market's optimism that Denver's newcomers -- Cameron Johnson , Bruce Brown , Tim Hardaway Jr . and Jonas Valanciunas -- will perform slightly better when paired with three-time MVP Nikola Jokic . 4. LA Clippers Projected wins: 49.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 47.5 Why they project to be better than their total: A rosy projection for Kawhi Leonard 's health is a key factor. Leonard is projected for 66 games, along the lines of the 68 he played in 2023-24 but more than he has played in any other season with the Clippers. The Clippers also benefit from having no player rated worse than minus-0.5 points per 100 possessions projected for more than 200 minutes. 5. Houston Rockets Projected wins: 46.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Even before Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL on Sept. 22, Houston was projected under by the model. Kevin Durant hasn't driven winning success at the level his box score stats would imply since being traded to the Suns at the 2023 deadline. The gap was exacerbated, however, once VanVleet was injured. The Rockets' line has moved only a game from where it opened, and as I noted in the analysis of the injury, Houston's projection dropped by nearly four wins without the rock-solid point guard. The \"NBA Today\" crew reacts to how Fred VanVleet tearing an ACL will affect the Rockets in the 2025-26 season. 6. Los Angeles Lakers Projected wins: 45.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 48.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: This is an annual occurrence for the Lakers, whose line benefits from their popularity, particularly in Las Vegas. On average, the Lakers have finished 5.7 wins below their total since 2013-14, the biggest gap for any team. There certainly is reason to believe the Lakers could hit the mark if Luka Doncic plays at an MVP level in his first full season with the team. But the Lakers are far and away the league's top-heaviest team, with just four players projected better than league average. The other teams with fewer than five -- the Nets, Jazz and Wizards -- are all pegged for the lottery. 7. Memphis Grizzlies Projected wins: 44.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Memphis is starting at a higher point than last season's 48 wins. In terms of point differential, the Grizzlies ranked third in the West, behind the two conference finalists, and that's a better predictor going forward. Even with the loss of starting guard Desmond Bane to Orlando, Memphis still projects with a reasonable chance at avoiding the play-in. The team will have to monitor Ja Morant , who is week-to-week with a sprained left ankle suffered during Sunday's practice. 8. Minnesota Timberwolves Projected wins: 43.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 49.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Timberwolves were one of my model's big misses a season ago, winning 49 games while projected for 42.7. In part, Minnesota benefited from favorable health on the perimeter. Nickeil Alexander-Walker 's departure means one of the Wolves' young guards will have to step into a rotation role, and Terrence Shannon Jr. -- the most likely contender ahead of the season -- projects poorly. But don't blame Minnesota fans for thinking their team is underrated after back-to-back trips to the conference finals. 9. Dallas Mavericks Projected wins: 43.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Although I don't love how the players fit together in Dallas, the Mavericks certainly have plenty of talent with eight who rate better than league average, including Kyrie Irving (knee), who currently doesn't have a timetable for a return. Dallas is dependent on D'Angelo Russell solidifying the point guard spot until Irving returns, but this roster isn't getting quite enough credit due to Irving's injury and the Luka Doncic trade. 10. Sacramento Kings Projected wins: 43.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 34.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Similar to Dallas, Sacramento appears to have more talent than the narrative about the team suggests. Remember, the Kings won 40 games a season ago with a positive point differential. And while they dropped to a 36-win pace with Zach LaVine in the lineup after the De'Aaron Fox trade, they've upgraded at point guard with Dennis Schroder . The ceiling might not be high for Sacramento, but it's unlikely the Kings are anywhere near as out of the mix as their line suggests. 11. San Antonio Spurs Projected wins: 40.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 44.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: I understand the bet on Victor Wembanyama emerging as a top-five player this season despite a projection that's not quite so aggressive. We've seen similar breakthroughs for other transcendent prospects in Year 3. The rest of the roster, however, leaves much to be desired. No. 2 draft pick Dylan Harper is unlikely to help the Spurs win as a rookie, and Stephon Castle 's advanced stats in Year 1 didn't match his Rookie of the Year reputation. 12. Portland Trail Blazers Projected wins: 35.8 ESPN BET over/under total: 33.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Portland won 36 games in 2024-25 and upgraded in my projections by swapping Anfernee Simons for Jrue Holiday . The market is right to be skeptical of Portland's 23-18 second half, driven in large part by poor opponent 3-point shooting (34%, second lowest in the NBA), which doesn't typically carry over. Still, this line seems like an overcorrection for a team that wants to compete for a play-in spot. 13. Phoenix Suns Projected wins: 34.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I get the logic that Phoenix won 36 games last season then subtracted Kevin Durant. However, the Suns were probably due for some degree of bounce-back after underperforming their projections a season ago, and Durant's value at this stage of his career is likely overstated. It's also worth remembering that Phoenix will have no incentive to accumulate losses late in the season because the team's draft pick has been swapped to the point of irrelevance. 14. New Orleans Pelicans Projected wins: 32.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 30.5 Why they project to be better than their total: That's a remarkably low figure for a team that has plenty of NBA talent. New Orleans ranked in the NBA's top five in games lost to injury last season, and it should have better health this time around, even if Dejounte Murray 's Achilles rupture will cost him much of the campaign. Like the Suns, the Pelicans don't benefit from improving their draft pick, which was sent to the Hawks on draft night. 15. Utah Jazz Projected wins: 20.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 18.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Teams with lines this low typically go over, including two of the bottom three teams from last season. In Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen , the Jazz have a pair of above-average starters to counteract the issues caused by their young backcourt. 1. Cleveland Cavaliers Projected wins: 50.1 ESPN BET over/under total: 56.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Cavaliers are probably due some regression to the mean after jumping from 48 wins to 64 last season. Part of that relates to health, and Cleveland already has two starters (All-Star guard Darius Garland and wing Max Strus ) sidelined to start the season, forcing Kenny Atkinson deeper into his perimeter rotation than he had to go last season. The Cavaliers are still a strong pick to claim the East's top seed but perhaps with a lower win total than in 2024-25. 2. Orlando Magic Projected wins: 49.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 51.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: If anything, my projections are probably more bullish on the Magic, who place just a hair behind Cleveland for the best in the East. The small discrepancy can probably be attributed to overlooking the schedule, a factor that is easy to overrate but one that is not specifically included in these projections. Orlando also dealt for Desmond Bane this past summer, a move that should contribute to their success. 3. New York Knicks Projected wins: 47.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 53.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The Knicks outperformed last season's 45.4-win projection by 5.5 games, benefiting from strong in-season health. Among New York's starting five, only Jalen Brunson missed as many as nine games due to injury or illness. That might be difficult to replicate. And I'm also counting on fewer minutes for the Knicks' top players with Mike Brown replacing Tom Thibodeau as coach. I'd expect New York to finish somewhere between these two marks, ending around 50 wins. 4. Indiana Pacers Projected wins: 45.9 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . Why they project to be better than their total: Even though former Indiana center Myles Turner -- now with the Bucks -- will be difficult to replace, this number feels shockingly low. The Pacers were still competitive last season when they were without Tyrese Haliburton , who will miss the 2025-26 campaign with a torn right Achilles. And Indiana's replacements at center -- most notably stretch big man Jay Huff -- do rate better than conventional wisdom. I'm not confident Indiana can finish in the same spot in the standings as last season, but I like the Pacers' chances of being better than .500. 5. Boston Celtics Projected wins: 45.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 40.5 Why they project to be better than their total: As with Indiana, there might be too much focus on the players Boston lost and not enough on the ones who remain. The Celtics still have eight players projected better than average -- tied for eighth most in the league -- including All-Star Jaylen Brown and statistical standout Derrick White . The caveat here is that Boston could subtract during the season to avoid the luxury tax and take a chance at the lottery before Jayson Tatum -- likely out for the season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon -- returns. 6. Milwaukee Bucks Projected wins: 44.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be better than their total: I might point out that Milwaukee has Giannis Antetokounmpo and leave it at that. The Bucks went 11-5 last season in games Antetokounmpo played without Damian Lillard , albeit against a weak schedule, and they've upgraded at center from Brook Lopez to Myles Turner. Due in part to that success, my model is higher on guards AJ Green , Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins than conventional wisdom would suggest. Stephen A. Smith explains why everyone except Jalen Brunson should be available from the Knicks to get Giannis Antetokounmpo. 7. Atlanta Hawks Projected wins: 44.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 46.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The hype might be getting a little heavy for the Hawks, whose offseason was undoubtedly positive but perhaps not transformative in the short term. I'm higher than the model on Atlanta's chances of avoiding the play-in, but I would still be surprised if they finish in the East's top four. 8. Detroit Pistons Projected wins: 42.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 45.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Largely because of the loss of Malik Beasley , arguably Detroit's second-best player last season after All-Star centerpiece Cade Cunningham . Replacements Caris LeVert and Duncan Robinson don't rate anywhere near as effectively as Beasley, who finished second in the NBA in made 3-pointers last season. Relying more on young talent could cause the Pistons to take a short-term step back. 9. Toronto Raptors Projected wins: 40.7 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: The Raptors' moves have capped their upside but should produce a competitive team given reasonable health. Toronto was in the top 10 in games missed due to injury or illness, including Brandon Ingram sitting out the remainder of the season after being acquired from New Orleans at the deadline. One quiet move my model likes: the addition of Sandro Mamukelashvili , who was effective last season with the Spurs. 10. Miami Heat Projected wins: 40.3 ESPN BET over/under total: 38.5 Why they project to be better than their total: We're not far apart here. Adding Norman Powell should help Miami remain competitive with Tyler Herro sidelined to start the season following surgery to address an impingement in his left foot. 11. Philadelphia 76ers Projected wins: 38.4 ESPN BET over/under total: 42.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: The optimism around the Sixers is a bit mystifying; their roster looks worse on paper with the loss of key frontcourt contributor Guerschon Yabusele . If Joel Embiid is healthy and effective, Philadelphia probably would finish better than .500. But even the 1,440 minutes I've projected for Embiid feel optimistic at this point; he last played that much in 2022-23 en route to being named MVP. And fellow injury question mark Paul George no longer rates as an elite player after last season's performance. 12. Chicago Bulls Projected wins: 38.0 ESPN BET over/under total: 31.5 Why they project to be better than their total: This feels like a case of the market not paying attention. Chicago has won either 39 or 40 games across each of the past three campaigns, and they went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season without Zach LaVine. The Bulls have made it clear they'd rather pursue a play-in berth than a high spot entering the lottery. Chicago's direction leaves much to be desired, but the Bulls should be competitive. 13. Charlotte Hornets Projected wins: 28.5 ESPN BET over/under total: 26.5 Why they project to be better than their total: Things can't go as badly as last season, when the Hornets went 19-63 with the third-most games lost due to injury in the league. Adding Collin Sexton will give the Hornets a go-to scorer with LaMelo Ball on the bench or sidelined, and 2023 No. 2 pick Brandon Miller should be expected to take a step forward in his development. 14. Brooklyn Nets Projected wins: 17.6 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given the number of rookies on the roster, I expected Brooklyn to have the league's worst projection. The Nets also have just two players who rate better than league average. Still, there's enough talent with the additions of Haywood Highsmith , Terance Mann and Michael Porter Jr. in salary dumps to keep Brooklyn competitive to start the season. 15. Washington Wizards Projected wins: 14.2 ESPN BET over/under total: 20.5 Why they project to be worse than their total: Given how my model tends to compress the expected standings to avoid bad misses, this is a shockingly low projection for the Wizards. In fact, it's the worst I've calculated for a team since adopting this model in 2010. After trading away veterans at the deadline and again this past summer, Washington doesn't have a single player who rates in the league's top 130."}

Smith explains why he takes issue with LeBron James' \"Second Decision\" video. (2:00) Amid a very busy year -- a stunning trade and max contract extension , playoffs in a new city and EuroBasket competition -- Luka Doncic achieved an under-the-radar accomplishment in 2025. Thanks to a host of happy Los Angeles Lakers fans celebrating their new star, Doncic had the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, breaking an 11-year run where LeBron James or Stephen Curry 's jersey sales led the league. A decade removed from the start of Curry's and James' Finals clashes, the NBA is still largely defined by those living legends, now 37 and 40 years old, respectively. It's not just the jersey sales, though they ranked second and third, respectively, behind Doncic. James and Curry also ranked first and second in 2024-25 as the most-viewed players on the NBA's social media platforms, and they're first and second in Instagram followers. They drive more narrative conversations and TV ratings than any other stars: They were the chief protagonists and most scintillating players during Team USA's gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The obvious question is who comes next. For decades, the NBA has been blessed with a natural passing of the baton, as the face of the league mantle shifted from Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to Michael Jordan; from Jordan to Kobe Bryant; from Bryant to James and, soon after, Curry. Yet there is no clear candidate to follow James and Curry. This isn't an unusual situation, necessarily; plenty of ostensible \"next Jordans\" failed to reach that level before Bryant came close. But it's a testament to how difficult it is to predict who will emerge as the next face of the NBA before it happens; there is no one set path for each face to follow, but rather a variety of different routes to the top of the heap. Let's examine those possible paths, and in doing so, identify the active players most suited to follow James, Curry and other past faces. Talent and on-court achievements matter -- every previous representative is an all-time great -- but so do a host of other soft factors that influence popularity and impact. Those elements needed to combine in the right way to produce past faces of the NBA. Could they do so again for current stars angling to succeed Curry and James? James' ascension to face of the league was preordained, from the moment the then-17-year-old appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover next to the words \"The Chosen One.\" James has surpassed even the loftiest expectations, and he followed a consistent, methodical trajectory to the top spot in the player hierarchy : No. 1 draft pick to Rookie of the Year to second-year All-Star to best player on a Finals team to Olympic gold medalist to MVP to celebrated free agent to champion. At no point during that run did James deviate from his face of the league path. Even before he won a title, more than 13 million people tuned in to watch James' \"Decision,\" when he announced his move to Miami in 2010. The active analogue: Entering the 2023 draft, Victor Wembanyama was touted as the best NBA prospect since LeBron 20 years earlier, and he's given no indications otherwise through two seasons. Like James, Wembanyama's jaw-dropping skills, indefatigable work ethic and incredible basketball mind make him suited for the role. His off-the-court interests could help his fame transcend San Antonio's relatively small market, much as James did with Cleveland. When ESPN's Tim Bontemps surveyed 20 coaches, scouts and executives last month, 16 predicted Wembanyama will be the NBA's best player in 2030. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list There are a couple of obstacles that could block Wembanyama's seemingly straightforward path to follow in James' footsteps, though. The first is Wembanyama's position. Arguably, no big man has been the face of the league since Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s. (Depending on your definition, perhaps Shaquille O'Neal snuck in for a brief period between Jordan and Bryant.) Even all-time greats such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan couldn't overcome that positional bias, perhaps because it's more difficult for fans to relate to 7-footers than to perimeter players. Wembanyama also will make history as the first international player to become the face of the league. The consensus top four players in the NBA -- Nikola Jokic , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- are all foreign-born and haven't seized the crown yet, and none look like slam dunk successors to Curry and James. Antetokounmpo might be the closest, as the leading All-Star vote getter in the past two seasons -- either James, Bryant or Curry led for 11 seasons in a row before Antetokounmpo -- but he's already 30 years old and running out of time to stake a true claim. Still, Wembanyama has enough in his favor that he's probably the top choice to be the NBA's next face. Even his competition agrees. Last season, a reporter asked Anthony Edwards if he considered himself a candidate for the position. \"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\" Nothing captures the imagination quite like an athletic 2-guard who can score in a variety of ways: Contested jumpers, acrobatic layups, ferocious dunks. Because of Jordan, this is likely the player archetype most associated with the face of the league designation. For years during Jordan's career, people wondered who his successor would be. And then Bryant arrived, doing his best Jordan imitation, and carried the mantle for another decade-plus after Jordan left the Bulls. The active analogue: Despite his protestations, Edwards is the natural choice to follow this path, as a charismatic, braggadocious shooting guard with immense talent and competitive zeal. Few active players can score in more diverse ways than Edwards, who led the NBA in made 3-pointers last season and has never met an opposing 7-footer he didn't want to posterize. And if an international face doesn't rise to the occasion, then Edwards might be the best option available, though he has faced on-the-court controversies . In Bontemps' survey, Edwards received 11 of 20 votes for the best American player in 2030. Other potential candidates in this mold abound because the sport is flush with high-octane guards. The possibilities even filter to college: Could the next face of the NBA be Kansas's Darryn Peterson , the top prospect in the 2026 draft, who has already drawn plenty of Kobe comparisons as he enters his freshman year? One final candidate worth discussing is more outside the box but still fits the pattern. Bryant was a first-time All-NBA honoree in his third season, then an All-Defensive player and the second-best player on a championship team in his fourth. Even though he took the backseat to MVP O'Neal on the Lakers for a time, he grabbed the face crown and didn't let go. There's an active player who just accomplished all of those feats -- All-NBA, All-Defensive Team, second-best player on a champion -- in his third season. It's not likely that Oklahoma City Thunder wing Jalen Williams will emerge as the face of the NBA in the years to come, but it's not impossible, either. He's following a proven blueprint, and he's only improving for a potential dynastic champion. In June, Williams became the youngest player since Magic Johnson to score 40 points in a Finals win.

For more information, click here . There's no statistical marker for face of the league, no physical award or Basketball Reference designation; rather, paraphrasing former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart -- discussing a very different subject matter -- you know it when you see it. Given such subjective criteria, context matters; where a star plays, and in what nationally televised games and showcase events, can be almost as important as skill and statistical accomplishments. That's why so many of the historical faces of the league have been mononymous Lakers, including Magic, Kobe and LeBron. Even the literal face of the NBA -- Jerry West , \"the Logo\" -- starred for the franchise with the most glitz and glamor and Finals appearances. The active analogue: James' successor as the leading Laker might be his successor as the face of the league, too. Doncic faces the same international hurdle as Wembanyama, but he's otherwise a perfect candidate. He's the right age (26), clutch, a statistical marvel and highlight machine. Doncic made a Finals trip in Dallas, but he might be better positioned for true top-tier superstardom in Los Angeles if he can help the Lakers win their 18th title. After all, it wasn't until Doncic joined the Lakers that he finally broke the James/Curry stranglehold on the top spot for jersey sales. Curry is the most out-of-nowhere face the NBA has ever had. The skinny guard captivated with a March Madness run in college, but nagging injuries and a lack of playoff appearances meant he didn't fully emerge for years in the NBA. He didn't even make an All-Star team until his age-25 season -- then won the championship and MVP trophy the following year. The active analogue: Curry's exact path is impossible to duplicate. But let's try. We need to identify a player who captivated the masses in college, but who hasn't had much sustained NBA success yet because of injuries and zero playoff appearances. He's a unique force when healthy, though. And ideally, he's also heading into his age-25 season. There is one player who meets all of those criteria. And while the hype for Zion Williamson has diminished since he was a sensation at Duke in 2018-19, it's still simmering rather than completely gone. Despite all the stops and starts, he looks great in the 2025-26 preseason. If not Williamson, another outside-the-box candidate is LaMelo Ball , an injury-prone guard with incredible shooting range and highlight reels. One quality of the face of the league is a near universal fandom, and independent of geography. Jordan was immensely popular far outside Chicago, and just about every kid chucking 3s at any playground across the country worships Curry. That's an advantage for Ball, a favorite of the increasing number of fans who follow basketball through social media and highlights. He's the youngest of 13 active NBA players with at least 10 million Instagram followers. (The second youngest is Doncic; the third youngest is Lonzo Ball .) It might seem shocking to suggest that Williamson or Ball -- two presently underachieving players on bad teams -- might one day command the same attention as Curry. But it would have been equally shocking if NBA observers circa 2012 learned that Curry would develop into a four-time champion, two-time MVP and indisputable face of the league. What's better than one face of the league? Two faces who can oppose each other on opening night, during Christmas showcases and in high-stakes playoff clashes. Curry's constant meetings with James helped boost his Q score, and the rivalry between Bird and Johnson -- which began in college and continued through nearly a decade of Finals meetings -- is the stuff of books and documentary films. Ultimately, the NBA tells a story. And natural foils are a tried-and-true storytelling tactic. Look toward opening night of the 2025-26 NBA season, when James' Lakers will face Curry's Warriors on the national stage yet again. The active analogue: As difficult as it is to predict which individual players will blossom into superstars, it's even more difficult to predict what rivalries will materialize in the years to come. The ideal scenario is that one develops organically, as charismatic stars meet in the playoffs year after year. For instance, Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't parlayed his extraordinary 2024-25 success into any face of the league talk yet. Still, he could rise further alongside either Doncic or Edwards, whom he's already faced in one playoff series apiece. Rivalries could also launch a potential face into the real thing. Take for instance if former No. 1 picks Cooper Flagg and Wembanyama develop a rivalry as the two have the potential to battle not only in a highly competitive conference but in the Olympics as well. Or perhaps Flagg will go head-to-head with Doncic, given the clear opening for a Mavericks-Lakers rivalry in the years to come. In Bontemps' survey, Flagg received five votes as the best American player in 2030, placing him second to Edwards in that category. The most recent No. 1 pick has yet to play a single NBA game that counts -- but along with Wembanyama, Doncic, Edwards and others, he's already one of the leading candidates to ascend to the most important social position in the NBA."}

Wright details how Victor Wembanyama pushed himself this offseason to improve for the upcoming season. (1:11) INSIDE A QUIET gym located on a sprawling 400-acre ranch in Katy, Texas, some 30 miles due west of Houston, Victor Wembanyama backed down new San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Rashard Lewis near the basket. The 21-year-old pupil was there to attend one of the most secretive, legendary big man camps in basketball -- one whose teacher has quietly mentored Giannis Antetokounmpo , LeBron James , Dwight Howard and many others. Even Kobe Bryant spent time on this most hallowed of grounds. Other Spurs assistants, Matt Nielsen and Sean Sweeney, looked toward the court, where the future of NBA big men was learning from one of the icons of its past. The court, painted in Houston Rockets red, was emblazoned with a No. 34 at the center of it. Above it was his famed nickname in cursive. Dream. Wembanyama met the 62-year-old Hakeem Olajuwon in April at the NCAA men's college national championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. They sat courtside. \"He said he would love to work out with me,\" Olajuwon, whose Hall of Fame NBA career included two championships, 12 All-Star appearances and an MVP award, told ESPN. \"I said, 'You've got everything already.' He said, 'No, no, no. I've watched you play, and I'd like to know now just the secrets behind all the moves. I would love that.'\" And so began a relationship that would cap a summer of transformation for Wembanyama. Six months earlier, he had been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, a condition both career- and life-threatening. The ordeal, one source close to him says, deeply affected the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year, so much so that it inspired \"a journey to push himself to be great physically and mentally with things that were outside the box.\" He played soccer in Costa Rica and Tokyo. He famously spent 10 days at a spiritual retreat at a Shaolin temple in Zhenzhou, China, where he studied and trained with monks. He hosted a chess and basketball tournament at his court in Le Chesnay, France. He visited NASA's Johnson Space Center, where he learned about astronaut Peggy Whitson, who owns the American record for spending 675 days in space. He spent time with another iconic big man, Kevin Garnett, seeking to tighten his grip on the mental side of the game. \"The traumatic experience ... is very much linked to all the stuff I've done in the summer,\" Wembanyama said. \"Spending so much time in hospitals, around doctors and hearing more bad news that I wish I hadn't heard, of course, it is traumatic. But in the long run I think it's going to be very beneficial because even though I don't wish it on [anybody], it makes you understand lessons that nothing else could have made you understand.\" Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson says he's never witnessed such perspective, or curiosity, from such a young player. \"He is so intentional in the variety of ways that he tries to improve as a player and person,\" Johnson said. \"It's constantly trying to push himself out of his comfort zone and learn new things. Sometimes, the levels he goes [to] and the things he thinks about that may be a small nuance, but he feels like if I can add this to my world being, mindset, [or] whatever it may be, it can help.\" BEFORE CAPTIVATING SOCIAL media in July with a failed bicycle kick in Costa Rica, in addition to smashing a looping free kick on the pitch in Tokyo, Wembanyama traveled to a historic Shaolin temple, one that was founded in the 5th century. When Wembanyama informed Spurs brass of his intentions, everyone was on board, one team source told ESPN, remaining true to the club's commitment to encourage the growth of its franchise player. \"The creativity is something that's been there from Day 1,\" Johnson said. \"We want this team to be in the reflection of Victor. He's our best player. He's our guy.\" For 10 days, Wembanyama woke up at 4:30 a.m., ate vegetarian breakfast bowls of zucchini and rice noodles and immersed himself in Chan meditation, a school of thought that emphasizes direct experience over intellectual learning. He studied Shaolin Kung Fu. He shaved his head. He wanted to go, he said, to put his mind and body under unusual stress, to increase his range of motion, to add strength, flexibility and balance through different exercises. \"It was an incredible experience,\" he said. \"Probably as far [off] a physical activity as I'm used to doing. It really paid off in terms of training and as a life experience as a curious person.\" People who have seen Wembanyama on the floor this summer say he's stronger, more under control playing through physicality and increasingly comfortable with his unprecedented skill set. \"We know the type of talent he is,\" teammate De'Aaron Fox said. \"I think people are learning the type of person that he is, as well. ... Him just looking at life differently, being able to travel and kind of come out with a different view on not only the sport, but on life, that's just a testament to the person that Victor is. I don't think it surprises anybody in this building.\" IT WAS EARLY September, and the 100-degree temperatures were finally subsiding in Texas. The start of training camp approached, heightening the excitement among a San Antonio fan base that hasn't seen its team reach the postseason in six seasons. Wembanyama and his teammates attended a Paris Saint-Germain game in January when the Spurs played the Indiana Pacers in France. While there, Johnson caught his first glimpse of the PSG ultras, a rowdy group of passionate fans that create a formidable atmosphere in the 47,929-capacity Parc de Princes stadium through monstrous banners, booming chants and even the use of flares and pyrotechnics. Wembanyama revealed to Johnson then that he wanted to create a similar setting at Frost Bank Center. So, on a cool Sept. 14 morning, fans traipsed into the Freeman Expo Hall adjacent to Frost Bank, loud and proud, screaming \"Go Spurs Go!\" Most sported Spurs gear, wigs, fiesta-themed clothing and face paint. Some even dressed as pirates to register for the first fan supporter tryouts with Wembanyama serving as the lone judge. Wembanyama leaned forward on a Spurs-themed chair resembling a replica of the ice block throne that George \"Iceman\" Gervin made famous in his iconic Nike poster back in 1978. Behind a curtain sectioned off just feet away from Wembanyama, nervous fans -- many meeting for the first time -- rehearsed the impromptu chants they would scream together minutes later. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . \"Wem-V-P!\" was the prevailing chant, drawing smiles from Wembanyama, who had pledged to cover the cost of tickets all season for the five most memorable fans. Intently, he scribbled notes in a black Spurs notepad on every auditioner and listened to their stories. He asked their names, level of dedication to the cause and even some personal questions before posing for pics as each exited. Some fans beat on a Spurs drum stationed in the back of the room once their turn to audition came. Wembanyama hit the drum, too, and led a chant. San Antonio general manager Brian Wright stood in the background near a curtain close to the exit next to CEO RC Buford taking in the scene. Arms folded, they watched carefully, almost in awe of how Wembanyama appreciatively embraced each second of dozens of interactions all morning with a fan base that treated those brief intros as moments forever seared into their hearts. Just four days prior, Wembanyama had led the Spurs onto the court at Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas, where a massive flood in July had left at least 136 people dead in a region that included communities in Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, Mason and Hunt. Wembanyama emerged from the back of the gym, tossing black Spurs T-shirts into the crowd and clapping while the sounds of shrieking students pierced the stuffy afternoon air. Wembanyama slapped hands with one young boy in the front row. The rest of the team took center court behind the Frenchman for a light workout consisting of layups, three-man weave drills, a half-court shot competition and dozens of thunderous dunks, some coming on ridiculous lobs thrown off the wall behind the baskets. Wembanyama tossed a self alley-oop and caught the ball midair, taking it through his legs for a jam drawing delighted cheers. Now, all that's left for Wembanyama is to return to the court. Victor Wembanyama hits the gym with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason. BACK INSIDE OLAJUWON'S gym, the Rockets icon asked Wembanyama what he wanted to accomplish, a question more existential than cliché after this summer of international experience. \"He basically wanted to know how to leverage. Let's leverage any opportunities you have, inside, outside, with opportunities in different situations without wasting energy,\" Olajuwon told ESPN. \"I know how skilled he is. So, our concept was not for 'big men.' Our concept was 'big guards.' You don't want to dribble like a big man. We are big guards where you can play 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 with the freedom to create outside, inside, crossover and pull up without wasting any energy with any player because you have the advantage every night on everybody.\" Through four 2½-hour workouts in early September, Wembanyama developed his own variation of the Hall of Famer's \"Dream Shake\" in addition to other tightly-wound spin moves that might leave opponents dizzy this upcoming season. Then, there's the jump hook Wemby is keeping under wraps. \"Yeah, that's part of his moves,\" Olajuwon said. \"You know how well he can shoot, right? Can you imagine putting in the moves with him finishing his shots? If somebody like him can jump hook, you're at his mercy. You can't get to it. You can't get to his jump shot or jump hooks. \" Teammate Jeremy Sochan says he's already witnessed the evolution. \"You see how hard he works and how motivated he is,\" Sochan said. \"He's super exciting to see and he's ready. I think you guys are going to see a lot that's going to shock you.\" Wembanyama, for his part, credits his most unusual offseason. \"I can assure you nobody has trained like I did this summer,\" he said. \"I think I've maxed out what I could do in one summer. Now, I need to play basketball.\""}

(1:22) AS GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO grappled with his Milwaukee Bucks future this offseason, general manager Jon Horst made the 6,000-mile trek to Athens, Greece, in late July for a face-to-face meeting with his franchise's cornerstone star -- the 2021 NBA champion and Finals MVP. Horst was coming off a transformative summer for the Bucks, having made the daring move to waive and stretch Damian Lillard to free up the cap space to sign center Myles Turner from the rival Indiana Pacers . It was a major long-term financial commitment, in terms of not only Turner's four-year, $108 million contract but also the cap hit from the remaining $113 million on Lillard's deal that would stay on Milwaukee's books for the next five seasons. It was a full-fledged effort to keep Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. However, the Bucks had not sought Antetokounmpo's approval or consultation before making the move, just as they hadn't required it when acquiring Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2023. The 2019 NBA Executive of the Year, Horst has been with Milwaukee since 2008 and took over the GM role in 2017. This marked the third time he has creatively doubled down on the Antetokounmpo-led Bucks, after acquiring Jrue Holiday in 2020 and Lillard in 2023. So in Athens, Horst sat with Antetokounmpo and one of his agents, Giorgos Panou, for the sides' most seminal and candid meeting of the summer. It was meant to be an open forum to discuss any lingering hard feelings following Milwaukee's third consecutive first-round exit and thoughts on anyone's mind about the Bucks' moves. The architect of the Bucks' first title-winning team in 50 years laid out his vision for the 2025-26 season, saying he believed this version of the roster could compete for a championship in the Eastern Conference. Antetokounmpo then responded. After Horst expressed his confidence in the Bucks' roster and his moves, Antetokounmpo aired his concerns about whether this team could truly achieve championship contention, and he wanted to explore whether there would be an alternative path forward for both the team and the player, league sources said. In the end, Antetokounmpo returned to Milwaukee for the start of the 2025-26 season. With Antetokounmpo participating at EuroBasket, the Bucks reached an agreement in late August to bring back his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo on a guaranteed one-year, $2.9 million deal. At least for the moment, the sides had found a common ground to stay together. However, one of the game's greatest-ever players is a hot-button topic around the league entering the new season, and a final resolution could still await. In fact, the path to this point was far from straight, and it nearly led the two-time NBA MVP to finding a new home in New York. SINCE CAPTURING THE title in 2021, then coming up one win shy of a return trip to the conference finals in 2022, the Bucks have been unable to win a playoff series. Milwaukee has lost in the first round in each of the past three seasons. Antetokounmpo became the second player in NBA history to average 30 points in the regular season before failing to win a playoff series in three straight seasons (Oscar Robertson from 1964-65 to 1966-67 was the first). An injury-plagued string of postseasons hampered the Bucks, with Antetokounmpo and Lillard missing significant chunks of the playoffs and being unable to fulfill their championship quest over the past two seasons. Though it seemed Antetokounmpo and Lillard gave the Bucks hope as long as they were in Milwaukee uniforms, their partnership came to an unexpected end when Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the 2025 playoffs, knocking him out for the 2025-26 season. Ever since the NBA draft combine in mid-May, Alex Saratsis, an Octagon managing director and Antetokounmpo's U.S.-based representative, has fielded rampant interest in Antetokounmpo and conducted serious due diligence on best possible outside fits should the star and his reps push to be traded from the Bucks. Several teams were discussed internally, but one emerged as the only place Antetokounmpo wanted to play outside of Milwaukee: the New York Knicks , multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN. Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here . The Bucks picked up the Knicks' call on Antetokounmpo, and the sides engaged in conversations for a window of time in August, league sources said, but the teams never got traction on a deal. The Bucks insisted to the Knicks that they preferred not to move Antetokounmpo, but those in Milwaukee believe New York did not make a strong enough offer to continue even discussing a trade, league sources said. It's unclear how the Bucks would have responded to an all-out chase by the Knicks. The multiweek process was described by one source with direct knowledge of the talks as an exclusive negotiating window. New York, for its part, believes the Bucks never were serious about entertaining an Antetokounmpo trade, sources said. The Knicks have had an eye on Antetokounmpo for the past couple of years under president Leon Rose, who heads a front office that built the franchise into a perennial playoff contender since taking over in 2020. People in league circles, including some in New York, have believed since 2024 that Antetokounmpo would eventually want to come to the Knicks if he ever explored a trade. Even with that knowledge, the Knicks made a series of moves independent of Antetokounmpo's potential desires to try to move the franchise closer to a title. New York traded its treasure chest of draft picks to acquire Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets in June 2024, then sent Julius Randle , Donte DiVincenzo and a first-rounder to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns in early October 2024. The Knicks then signed Bridges to a four-year, $150 million extension this August, which makes him ineligible to be traded until February. Those maneuvers left New York's pool of nonplayer assets limited to one first-round pick, three pick swaps and eight second-rounders, essentially decimating its ability to make an overwhelming offer to Milwaukee. As is, the Knicks, who are coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, enter the season as the co-favorites in the East along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . ANTETOKOUNMPO HAS EXPRESSED publicly and privately over the past few years that he wants to win a second championship and that any failure to put the Bucks in a position to do so could lead him to look elsewhere. \"I want to be on a team that allows me and gives me a chance to win a championship,\" Antetokounmpo said Sept. 29 at media day, where he appeared remotely after missing the start of training camp due to COVID-19, according to the team. \"I think it's a disservice to basketball, just to the game, to not want it to compete in a high level, to want your season to end in April.\" In a telling exchange, Bucks managing governor Wes Edens said at media day that he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo in June when the Bucks star expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. An hour later, Antetokounmpo said: \"I cannot recall that meeting.\" Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now \"The last three years, we've been eliminated in the first round, so it's not much to talk about,\" he added. \"We just got to put our heads down and stay locked in the whole year long and try to win some games and hopefully get in the playoffs and then don't get eliminated in the first round. That's pretty much it. And then we go from there.\" Then last Saturday, after traveling from Greece to join the Bucks in Miami, Antetokounmpo said: \"I just want more. I want to win another championship. I want to win another medal for the national team. Legacy is very important for me. ... You got to play to win. I don't play to be around and get paid.\" Bucks sources had feared, in part because of Antetokounmpo's expressed desire to win another championship, that he would make a formal trade request during the week of July 28 when Horst embarked on his one-day trip to Greece. League sources close to the situation were expecting the same thing. Antetokounmpo was continually asking himself, even after the Bucks' stunning release of Lillard to sign Turner: Can this roster truly compete for a title? Antetokounmpo had serious questions and shared his feelings directly with Horst, league sources said. This offseason marked the first time that Antetokounmpo truly initiated the pursuit of his best external options, and he had discussions with the Bucks that ultimately led to the conversations between the franchise and the Knicks. Fast-forward months now, and he'll be paying close attention not only to how the Bucks perform to start the season but also to the landscape of the rest of the league. Bucks owners Jimmy Haslem and Edens, along with Horst and coach Doc Rivers, were adamant all offseason that they wanted to keep Antetokounmpo, that it would be extremely difficult to pry him away. Rival executives believed the only way Antetokounmpo could have forced a move elsewhere was by making a spectacle and pushing himself out like several NBA stars who requested trades in recent years. But those who know Antetokounmpo well say that is the antithesis of who he is, and ultimately, he applied no public pressure to Milwaukee this summer. He has built an image on loyalty, and his actions, specifically contract extensions with the franchise in 2020 and 2023, have come without prior warning and through his own declaration. • Nos. 10-1 : Who's No. 1? • Nos. 50-11 : Who just missed the top 10? • Nos. 100-51 : Flagg's debut ranking • Picks for 2026 : Pelton's 10 players to watch • Roundtable: Biggest snubs and surprises from the new top 100 Now he returns to the Bucks for his 13th season having stuck with Milwaukee through the highs and lows. He has this season and the 2026-27 campaign left on his current deal before the ability to opt out and become a free agent, but whether he stays in a Milwaukee uniform to that point remains in heavy question. It is expected that Antetokounmpo will keep his options open depending on how the Bucks start the season, according to league sources. From the outset of the season, the pressure is apparent throughout the organization like never before. It's seen as a make-or-break season in Milwaukee. Stakeholders within the organization understand that the first quarter of the campaign will hold significant weight for the future direction. Antetokounmpo will also have a grip on teams across the league this season because franchises will want to ensure they are positioned well in the seismic event of his trade. For Antetokounmpo, the moment of peak leverage will come next summer when he has just one guaranteed season remaining on his contract. On Oct. 1, 2026, he will be eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension through the 2030-31 season, and he'd be able to sign the same deal with another team six months after a trade if he is moved. That will increase his ability to position where he wants to be dealt if he chooses to seek a trade because any team willing to give the steep price necessary to acquire him would want to know whether he is committed for the long term. For now, the Bucks' organization believes in its ability to contend in the East with Antetokounmpo on its side and season-altering injuries to Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Boston's Jayson Tatum opening up the top of the conference. Antetokounmpo is coming off his second consecutive season averaging 30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 60% shooting; no other player has done that even once in NBA history. Now, with Lillard gone, the offensive burden on Antetokounmpo entering the season will only increase. His ability to be superhuman every night gives the Bucks belief that this team can challenge anyone in the East. Milwaukee has not dipped into the luxury tax for this season, but waiving Lillard to bring in Turner puts an additional $22.5 million on its books for each of the next five seasons. The team's play will determine whether Antetokounmpo becomes a viable trade target in-season and whether he tests his best external options, once again, during the heat of competition. The whole league continues to watch because what looms is one simple question: Will the window for Antetokounmpo reopen before next summer?"}

Some players are more ready to make an impact right away, while others may never catch up with the NBA game. Then there are the players that just need time, and either during their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they find that they're ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball drafts, it will be up to you to identify which players fit into which category and pick accordingly. That's where I come in. Even as the playoffs were still going, I was already deep into NBA draft research with an eye on how their skills might fit on the teams that could draft them. Then I went out to the desert and scouted the Las Vegas Summer League to watch the top prospects in person. I wanted to see how they moved, what their energy looked like and whether they seemed to have that extra bit of dog in them that will help them transition to the NBA. Let's take a look at the top-10 rookies and when you should consider taking them in your fantasy basketball drafts. Cooper Flagg , SF/PF, Dallas Mavericks : Flagg has been touted for years as a future NBA superstar, and the outlook for his rookie season is more similar to the last historically touted rookie, Victor Wembanyama two seasons ago, than any of the rookies in last season's class. Flagg led his college team, the Duke Blue Devils , in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals per game. He showed me in the Las Vegas Summer League that he had the size, strength and mindset to have an immediate impact at the NBA level. The Mavericks have a roster strong enough to compete for the playoffs but a distinct hole in the perimeter offense with Kyrie Irving (ACL) sidelined for at least the first half of the season. As such, the door is open for Flagg to be the primary offensive threat from the wing for the Mavs from the start. I have him projected firmly in my preseason fantasy hoops top 50 , and conservatively expect him to be drafted in the first four rounds. Want to test out different approaches? Try out the ESPN Mock Draft Lobby . Outside of Flagg, there are several other rookies with the talent to produce fantasy-worthy numbers if things work out. But they aren't necessarily guaranteed to do so from the opening tip, or even in the opening months of the season. Let's talk about some of the ones with the best opportunity to produce in a timely enough fashion to be worthy of being drafted in fantasy hoops leagues. Ace Bailey , SF/PF, Utah Jazz : He was considered one of the three most talented and NBA-ready players in the class, along with Flagg and Bailey's college teammate Dylan Harper . But while Harper was drafted to a San Antonio Spurs team with plenty of quality depth at his position, Bailey was drafted to become the offensive centerpiece for a rebuilding Jazz squad. Bailey has a legitimate chance to be the team's leading scorer as a rookie, and is the most likely rookie outside of Flagg to produce impact fantasy hoops numbers from the start. Dylan Harper , PG/SG, San Antonio Spurs : Outside of Flagg, Harper was the most impressive rookie I saw play at the Las Vegas Summer League. His skill set, size and athleticism popped and I gave him the credit to favorably compare his game to that of rookie Brandon Roy -- arguably the most impressive rookie guard performance I've seen in two decades of scouting the Summer League. If Harper had been drafted to a team that needed to utilize him to the fullest, he would likely be draftable in at least the middle rounds. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Instead, the Spurs feature All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox , along with reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and young veterans Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson on the wings. The Spurs have made it clear Harper is a key part of their future, but it is hard to see where he will have a fantasy-worthy impact right away. Harper could grow into it during the season, and his talent and upside are such that he could be worth stashing on a fantasy hoops bench even if he's not able to put up big numbers right away. Egor Demin , PG, Brooklyn Nets : Demin is the most likely to produce right away among the five first-round picks the Nets had in this year's draft. Demin is a big point guard who fits well in the starting backcourt next to undersized scorer Cam Thomas . Demin has been dealing with plantar fascia issues that could slow him at the start of the season, but once healthy Demin could be the type of all-category producer that has value in both points and category leagues. VJ Edgecombe , SG, Philadelphia 76ers : The Baylor product currently projects as a starting wing on the 76ers, particularly while Jared McCain is out. Edgecombe possesses explosive leaping ability and quickness on the wing, which helps him to be a finisher in the lane and on the fast break as well as helping defensively. He is an excellent defender that could contribute in steals and even blocks, a nice bonus for a guard. Edgecombe's projected role doesn't scream big numbers, as he's not a long-range shooter, but he has talent, opportunity and upside, which could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops drafts. Made it this far? Create your own league with your own rules and play against your friends today. Tre Johnson , SG, Washington Wizards : Johnson could be one of the best 3-point shooters in this year's class because he can shoot with both volume and accuracy off both the spot-up and the dribble. Johnson's ability to create his own shot is a boon for a rebuilding Wizards squad that doesn't have much perimeter talent. He could be worth a late-round flyer in fantasy hoops leagues because, if he can reach his upside as an upper-teens scorer with potentially the most 3-pointers in the rookie class, he could end up developing into a flex starter before the season ends. • Sign up and play for free! • Fantasy draft guide: rankings, mock drafts, more • Ultimate Draft Board: Best picks for every round • Sleepers, breakouts and busts • \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list Kon Knueppel , SG, Charlotte Hornets : Knueppel also has a case as the best shooter in this draft class, but he is known more for his spot-up shooting than his ability to create. There is fantasy value in being a knock-down 3-point shooter playing off of talented creator/scorer types. With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller and Collin Sexton doing more creating and scoring, and thus drawing more defensive attention, Knueppel could get more open shots against defenses not keyed on him. It isn't clear whether Knueppel will generate the volume to be of value in points leagues, but his ability to put up large numbers of 3-pointers could make him worthy of roster consideration in category leagues. Jeremiah Fears , PG/SG, New Orleans Pelicans : The former Sooner is a (excuse the pun) fearless shooter/scorer on the wing, and he could end up getting more minutes for the Pelicans early in the season because Dejounte Murray is sidelined until the New Year. Fears still projects as a sixth man at best, so it isn't clear he'll post fantasy-worthy numbers, but he is worth keeping an eye on as a free agent with upside. Khaman Maluach , C, Phoenix Suns : Maluach was drafted as a defensive role player in the middle for the Suns. He will likely come off the bench to begin the season, but keep in mind that he's backing up Mark Williams . Williams has missed 140 of 246 possible games in his career, never playing more than 44 games in any of his three NBA seasons. If Maluach ends up getting starter's minutes, his shot blocking could be of interest in category leagues. Nique Clifford , SG, Sacramento Kings : Clifford deserves a mention here. He's an older rookie at 23 years old, and after an impressive fifth season in college he turned in a dominant performance at the Las Vegas Summer League.

For the first time in his career, LeBron James will miss a season opener. The famously durable James is reportedly dealing with sciatica that should sideline him for at least 3-4 weeks . As new as a season-opening injury is to James, it's something we might need to get used to. James is 40. There is very little precedent of players even staying active to this age, let alone performing at the star-caliber level that James still did last season. We may not have much truly, 100% healthy James basketball left. That will be a problem that plays out for the Lakers over the course of the season. For now, they have more immediate concerns, like figuring out how to survive the beginning of the season without one of their superstars. So with James now sidelined for a bit, let's look at some of the ripple effects of this injury for the rest of the Lakers. Right off the bat, the Lakers just lost somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes per night at the beginning of the season with James sidelined. The guard they added this offseason, Marcus Smart , is currently dealing with Achilles tendinopathy, so there's no telling how much he'll be able to play as the season begins. To clear the room to bring him in, the Lakers needed to waive Jordan Goodwin , a rotation guard from last season. Not they could ever fully rely on him from a health perspective, but Maxi Kleber is also dealing with a quadriceps issue. In other words, there are seemingly minutes available early on. The irony here is that one LeBron James getting hurt could open the door for another LeBron James to play. Bronny is obviously a good deal smaller than his father. They play different positions. But the Lakers are relatively fluid positionally. Their two primary ball-handlers after all are the elder James and Luka Dončić, who are both forward-sized. In the event that LeBron, Smart and Kleber are sidelined, there are eight players who would almost certainly play: Dončić, Austin Reaves , Rui Hachimura , Jarred Vanderbilt , Gabe Vincent , Deandre Ayton , Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes . Most teams use nine or 10 in the regular season. Dalton Knecht is probably the major beneficiary, and it would behoove the Lakers to use him if only to boost his trade value. But don't be surprised if the Lakers give Bronny a bit of run early on just to see if he can handle it. His rookie season was pretty uninspiring, but there were positive signs at Summer League. The Lakers aren't built for Bronny to play real minutes when they're healthy, but this is potentially a chance to see how much he's grown early in the season and figure out if he deserves more chances later. Of course, without knowing how well he's played at camp and how available Smart will be, none of this is guaranteed. For all we know, one of the two-way guards, Nick Smith Jr . or Chris Manon , could have impressed enough to garner those early opportunities. We came into camp reasonably certain that four Lakers would start: James, Dončić, Reaves and Ayton. The competition has seemingly been between Smart and Hachimura, but Jarred Vanderbilt has a fringe case as well. While Smart is the more decorated defender, he's better-suited guarding bigger players at this stage of his career. That's less of a need for this Lakers roster, whereas Vanderbilt is better at defending guards. He's a worse offensive player, but, well, the Lakers can probably afford to spare some scoring. If Smart is healthy enough to start on opening day, the organic solution here might be to just start both he and Hachimura. Then, when James comes back, the Lakers could use the information from their first batch of games to make an informed, long-term decision. However, if they're worried about Smart defending fast guards, it might make sense to give Vanderbilt a longer look now. Hachimura's shooting is probably a must for the offense with no James, so this could be a matter of stylistic preference on defense. Plus, if the Lakers were leaning towards bringing Smart off of the bench, maintaining role continuity for an older player would probably be helpful. You've all heard the hype by now. Luka Dončić is in the best shape of his life. He's ready to prove the Mavericks wrong for trading him. All of that was true before James went down, but what changes is his immediate statistical upside. The Lakers have as much ball-handling as any team in the NBA . Even if Dončić has the best season of his career, it may not show up statistically because he'll probably have the ball less playing next to James and Reaves than he did in Dallas. If you were looking for a reason to doubt his MVP candidacy, that was it. Yes, James should return reasonably early in the season, but narratives form quickly. If Dončić bursts out of the gate posting 30-point triple-doubles carrying an undermanned Lakers team, that's going to draw quite a bit of attention. Even if he doesn't maintain that volume after James returns, narratives matter in MVP races. He now has a chance to grab an early lead with the whole league watching. Dončić has longer MVP odds than either of the past two winners, Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander . The best price on the board, as of Thursday evening, was +400 at Bet365. Whether or not those odds are fair is debatable, but I'd say Dončić is slightly likelier to mount a winning MVP case today than he was yesterday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James when they kick off the 2025-26 NBA season against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21, ESPN reports . James is reportedly sidelined for three to four weeks due to sciatica on his right side. This will mark the first time James missed a season opener in his 23-year career. Reports surfaced this week that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute , and would \"likely\" miss the entire NBA preseason . The hope was that the 40-year-old superstar would be ready to suit up for the season opener later this month, and it was reported that he was ramping up his workload. James enters his NBA-record 23rd season. He averaged 24.4 points, 78 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game last year. The NBA's all-time scoring leader opted into his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Lakers this offseason. Lakers coach JJ Redick said this offseason that the Lakers would be cautious with James' health, as he dealt with foot and ankle injuries that sidelined him in recent years. Still, the four-time NBA MVP and 21-time All-Star is incredibly important when it comes to this team's identity. The Lakers registered their first 50-win campaign since 2019-20 this past season, but lost in five games to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Last season was, of course, when the Lakers acquired Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks , who averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.5 assists in his 28 games played for the Lakers. Without a doubt, he will be the centerpiece on offense to begin the season for Los Angeles, but more will also be asked of Austin Reaves . The Lakers' sharpshooter was L.A.'s third-leading scorer behind Doncic and James with a career-high 20.2 points per game. Reaves' points per game and assists per game numbers have increased in all four of his NBA seasons, and he just became one of 10 players in Lakers history to average 20 points and five assists per game in a single season. As for who replaces James in the lineup to begin the year, that's where things get interesting. Redick could opt for new guard Marcus Smart , or keep things big and replace James with forward Jarred Vanderbilt instead. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "NBA GM survey takeaways: Nikola Jokić, Victor Wembanyama earn top accolades ahead of 2025-26 season", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-gm-survey-nikola-jokic-victor-wembanyama-earn-top-accolades-2025-26-season/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:32:50+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "Thunder viewed as overwhelming favorites to repeat as NBA champions", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NBA has released its annual GM survey, which polls all 30 general managers across the league to get their view on the upcoming season. It provides insight into who executives feel represent the best players and teams around the league, as well as what changes they want to see. It's not surprising that the rule everyone wants changed the most is roster construction relative to the harsh penalties the new CBA imposes on teams that pass that second apron. It's also not surprising that Stephen Curry was voted as the player GM's would want to take the shot with the game on the line. Some of the questions and answers are pretty straightforward, while others are worth digging into some more. With that in mind, let's break down some of these results from the 2025 NBA GM survey and see how the league's decision makers view this upcoming season. Jokić has already won thee MVP awards in the last five years, and you could argue he should be a perfect five for five in that category -- though Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were more than deserving of the honor in the years Jokić finished second in voting. There are few players who have had this type of staying power for the league's top individual award, and that streak of finishing first or second for the award doesn't appear to be stopping next season, either. Jokić received 67% of votes to win MVP for the fourth time, which would put him in a category with LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to win the award four times. On paper, Jokić is positioned well to win a fourth MVP award. The Nuggets reloaded around him, trading Michael Porter Jr . to the Brooklyn Nets for Cam Johnson. They also added Tim Hardaway Jr . and brought back Bruce Brown . It's a more complete roster than last season, and with the shooting depth Denver now has, we could see Jokić set a career high in assists after already averaging 10.2 dimes last season. We know Jokić will be operating at an MVP level, and if the Nuggets can raise their level of play from last season then Denver could be a viable threat to the Thunder to get to the NBA Finals. We're entering Year 3 of Wembanyama, and just like everyone else, the GM's around the league expect a massive season from the Frenchman. Wembanyama finished fourth in MVP voting, just a percentage behind reigning MVP Gilgeous-Alexander. He received an overwhelming number of votes, 83% of them to be exact, for the player general managers would most want to start a franchise with today. He was tied second for most likely to have a breakout season, finished second behind Jokić for best center, and took the top spot for best defensive player, best interior defender and was tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo as most versatile player in the league. None of those are really surprising on the surface, but it does indicate just how much every other team expects Wembanyama to dominate the league in the near future. And they're not wrong, either. It's only preseason, but we've already seen Wembanyama finish with a near triple-double (9 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) in just 16 minutes of action. He's also shown that he used the summer to put on some functional strength, as evidenced from this play when he drops his shoulder into teammate Luke Kornet during a scrimmage, which knocks the 7-foot-2, 250-pound big man off balance for Wemby for finish with the highlight dunk. slight preview 👀 @wemby pic.twitter.com/40glsd1CBy It's only a scrimmage, but moving Kornet like that is no small feat. Wemby's lanky frame was always going to be the biggest drawback early in his career, and already it appears like he's addressed that by adding weight to allow him to be more physical in the post. He also went through a mini growth spurt, as the Spurs are officially listing him as 7-foot-5, a two-inch increase from last season. Wembanyama's defense is already elite, but if his offensive game takes another leap, then it won't be surprising to see him get some MVP love this season. And if that's happening then that means the Spurs will be contending for a playoff spot, too. This isn't surprising in the slightest. The Thunder are built to be a title contender for at least the next five years, and honestly longer than that considering the pile of first-round draft picks they have at their disposal. What will be interesting to see is how motivated the Thunder stay over the course of the regular season, because we've seen so many defending champions fall victim to the post-championship hangover. We haven't had a repeat champion since the Warriors in 2018, and while the Thunder are in a great position to get a second title, everyone thought that about the Celtics last season and we saw how that went. Boston's downfall was due to Jayson Tatum suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs, but even leading up to that devastating moment, Boston slipped a bit after winning it all the year prior. Will we see the same slip from OKC? The league's top executives don't think so, and despite the gauntlet that is the Western Conference, OKC feels unbeatable at this point in time. If they can stay healthy and maintain that level of hunger to win it all again, then it won't be surprising to see the Thunder hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy again in June. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How realistic are Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers' championship aspirations?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-realistic-are-kawhi-leonard-and-the-clippers-championship-aspirations/", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:07:58+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Clippers, who are even deeper than they were before", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Wouldn't it be perfect if this was when it finally all came together for the Los Angeles Clippers ? Six years after Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers in free agency, he and the team are involved in what could turn out to be the biggest cap-circumvention scandal in NBA history. While they're being investigated, though, the Clippers are entering the season with perhaps the best roster they've ever had. Los Angeles had a deep roster last year, but now Brook Lopez is the backup center, and Chris Paul is back in the building. The front office effectively turned Norman Powell into Bradley Beal and John Collins , and, unlike 2023-24, Leonard is ready to play right away. This is an old team, and it's coming off a nightmarish Game 7 performance against the Denver Nuggets , but it had an amazing offseason. Until the Sep. 3 episode of \"Pablo Torre Finds Out\" dropped, that is. Last year: Despite letting Paul George walk in the summer of 2024, the Clippers outscored opponents by 1.3 points per 100 possessions without Leonard on the floor (in non-garbage-time minutes, per Cleaning The Glass) and went 24-19 in the games he missed. Leonard was one of the league's best players in March and April, but Los Angeles' 50-32 record was a testament to James Harden's playmaking, Powell's scoring and the team's third-ranked defense. With a series of moves in February, they acquired Bogdan Bogdanovic , Drew Eubanks , Patty Mills , and a couple of extra second-round picks in exchange for P.J. Tucker , Mo Bamba , Kevin Porter Jr., Terance Mann and Bones Hyland , and then they signed Ben Simmons off the scrap heap. Harden made his first All-NBA team since he left Houston, Ivica Zubac made his first All-Defensive team and the first six games of the Clippers' series against Denver were incredible. The final one, though, was a disaster: they were outscored 72-40 in the second and third quarters and trailed by as many as 35. The offseason: The biggest news was the aforementioned scandal, but, before all that, the Clippers traded Powell and a 2027 second-round pick for Collins and split their non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Lopez (two years, $17.9 million, team option) and Beal (two years, $11 million, player option), the latter of whom accepted a buyout from the Suns . They also re-signed Harden (two years, $81.5 million, player option) and Nicolas Batum (two years, $11.5 million, team option), signed Paul for the minimum and drafted big man Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick. Amir Coffey left for Milwaukee, and Simmons and Mills remain unsigned. Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Clippers believer: Everyone calls the Clippers \"deep,\" but I'm not sure that word adequately captures what their front office has put together. It's not just that they have 11 players who deserve to be in an NBA rotation; it's that they have every player archetype you can think of. They have an abundance of playmaking, shooting, perimeter defense, length and size. Tyronn Lue is going to have so much fun putting lineups together! I know you're going to complain about how old a lot of these guys are, but no team is better positioned to withstand injuries. Clippers skeptic: I mean, it's at least a little weird that John Collins, who just turned 28, is the youngest player who will regularly see the floor, isn't it? I get that the depth should help them deal with injuries that pop up during the regular season, but it doesn't make me feel much better about them getting through multiple playoff rounds. We just saw Lue go away from Derrick Jones Jr . and Kris Dunn in the postseason because the Nuggets were completely ignoring them on the perimeter. And if they get marginalized again, then I don't think you can say the Clippers have \"an abundance\" of perimeter defense. Clippers believer: Kawhi Leonard is a pretty damn good perimeter defender, too. Same with Nicolas Batum. But the point is that Lue has more pieces to play with this season, and the new ones will enhance what was already here. Both Jones and Dunn will be more viable in the playoffs because Brook Lopez and Collins can stretch the floor at the 5 spot. Jones is going to love screening for Chris Paul and rolling to the rim for easy dunks. The Clippers are going to be vastly improved on offense because their spacing is going to be better and they're going to take better care of the ball. I'm sure James Harden will be more efficient, too. Clippers skeptic: Doesn't this depend on who's actually on the floor? On paper, yeah, the Clippers look like a better, more well-rounded offensive team than they were, but we shouldn't be assuming Bradley Beal is going to stay healthy, especially since they're asking him to exert more energy on the defensive end than he has in recent years. They'll turn the ball over less frequently if Paul is the backup point guard every night, sure, but is that even the plan for him? In fairness, I totally understand talking yourself into this team. I've done that with previous Clippers teams, though, and I just don't buy that this year is going to be significantly different in the end. Beal is basically Powell with a more prestigious brand name. Lopez and Collins can make 3s, but playoff opponents aren't exactly going to be terrified of them spotting up. If the Clips are fortunate enough to make the second round, Paul will turn 41 during the series. Also, I know it's a small thing, but I'm confused about them letting Amir Coffey walk. He made 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s last season! Clippers believer: Coffey would have been their 12th-best player! I liked him just fine, but come on. Don't do the thing where you dismiss the Clippers because they've disappointed you in the past. Don't pretend the front office didn't transform the team in the summer. They've never had a 4/5 like Collins in this era, and, they've never had a guy like Lopez, either, unless you count The Idea Of Mo Bamba. This is an ideal situation for both of them, and I think it's the perfect place for Beal, too. I suspect Paul will be in the rotation much more often than not, but he's a home-run signing regardless. Last season, they really needed another steady hand, especially when Powell was hurt. This iteration of the Clippers would have beaten last year's Nuggets, and I'd pick them against the new and improved version of the Nuggets, too. I'd pick them against anybody except OKC right now, actually, and in a couple of months I might be ready to say they'll win the whole thing. Clippers skeptic: As long as Leonard's contract doesn't get voided, I can see the Clippers winning 50-plus games. They outscored opponents by 12.4 points per 100 possessions with Leonard on the court last season, and they've been similarly dominant in his minutes for most of his tenure. His health is a massive variable, though, and the same is true for virtually everybody else on the team. I was hoping they'd get younger and faster in the offseason, but they did the exact opposite, so I'm not sure where the big advantage is against a team like Denver. If the goal on an organizational level is not to win a championship but to put up a good fight while maintaining financial flexibility, then they've done an awesome job. I would hope, though, that they have higher aspirations than that . © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

It is not common for athletes to return expeditiously from a torn Achilles tendon, but Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum could be on a shorter timeline than some of his counterparts. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , the Celtics have not ruled out a return during the 2025-26 season for their top player and are \"cautiously optimistic\" about his chances of playing at some point during the campaign. That is a contrast to two other situations in the NBA , where the Indiana Pacers and Portland Trail Blazers already ruled out Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard for the season after they also suffered torn Achilles tendons in the 2025 playoffs. The Celtics' stance from a team perspective also aligns with Tatum's ambitions. The six-time NBA All-Star indicated last month on CBS Sports HQ that he would be open to playing this season if he is back at full strength in time to do so. \"I think the most important thing is making a full recovery and being 100%,\" Tatum said. \"If that's this season, there's obviously conversations to be had. For me, I love to play. I've never been a guy that wants to sit out and I try to play in every game possible.\" A pertinent factor in a potential 2025-26 return is the Celtics' standing in the playoff picture. If the team is out of the postseason hunt in the latter stages of the campaign, it could be less inclined to risk putting Tatum on the court. If he is healthy, though, the veteran forward could be the missing piece to a playoff run. After all, he was one of the NBA's top players before the injury and in 2024 guided the Celtics to a championship. Achilles injuries generally carry recovery timelines of at least a calendar year. Tatum tore his tendon on May 12 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, so any potential return in the upcoming regular season would put him well ahead of schedule. \"It's been tough, it's been a rollercoaster. It's been emotional,\" Tatum said in September. \"It's a new experience for me. ... Our first practice is a week from today and I won't be able to be out there with the team. I won't be out there to start the season. That's been a tough pill to swallow and something I've been working through every day.\" Tatum's looming absence, whether or not he returns at some point this season, will be the longest of his career to date. The perennial MVP vote-getter has not sat out more than 18 games in a season throughout his eight-year career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The USA Basketball men's national team will be seeking a sixth consecutive gold medal at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the man leading that quest will be Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra will be named the new coach of Team USA, according to Shams Charania , in an expected move as he served as the lead assistant on Steve Kerr's staff during the 2024 Olympics. Spoelstra's track record as the coach of the Heat speaks for itself, and he has the respect of the top NBA stars that would be playing for him in Los Angeles in 2028. USA Basketball has put an emphasis on continuity and culture ever since their stunning defeat in the 2004 Olympics, tasking Mike Krzyzewski with building a foundation that has been built upon by Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr to win five consecutive Olympic gold medals. Now, Spoelstra will be tasked with continuing that run of success in what is both a coveted position and one that comes with the highest of expectations. Anything but a gold medal is a failure for Team USA, and Spoelstra's biggest challenge will be leading the Americans into a new era without the likes of LeBron James , Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant . The 2028 USA Basketball roster will almost assuredly feature some major turnover from the 2024 squad that was headlined by that star trio. Those three will all be over 40 by the time the 2028 Olympics roll around, and Spoelstra will need to find new leadership on the USA Basketball roster that can keep the standard where it has been. Anthony Edwards , Jayson Tatum , Devin Booker , Tyrese Haliburton and Bam Adebayo all figure to be holdovers for 2028, but everyone else is a bit of a question mark. Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid will have the inside track to frontcourt spots, but they both carry the ever-present question of whether they'll be healthy enough to participate in an Olympic summer. Jrue Holiday is unlikely to make a third Olympic team at age 38, while Derrick White could be retained as a glue guy but will have plenty of competition for a spot. Despite stronger competition and more roster uncertainty at the top than USA Basketball has seen in decades, Spoelstra will not be given a reprieve on expectations. That said, if he can lead a new-look Team USA to a sixth straight gold on home soil in 2028, it will be one of the crowning achievements of his career. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Most of NBA history gave us a certain kind of Sixth Man of the Year winner. Between 2006 and 2022, 10 of the 17 winners were simply that season's leading bench scorer. Voters expect gunners in the sixth man role, and they tended to reward the best of them. But they've gotten a bit more open-minded in recent years. None of the last three winners have been the league's leading bench scorer, and 2024 winner Naz Reid wasn't even in the top 10. He was also only the third center to win the trophy. Payton Pritchard last year was a bit closer to the standard archetype as a high-scoring guard, but Malik Beasley out-scored him and lost. In other words, we can't simply point to the bench player who's going to take the most shots and assume he'll win anymore. This is still an award that favors guards and points, sure, but there's a bit more nuance involved now. It's fair to at least bring defense and efficiency into the conversation now. Winning has always been a staple, as the last winner to miss the playoffs was Lou Williams in 2018, but with each of our past three winners coming from top-three seeds, it has seemingly taken on an even bigger role in the voting. So let's dive into this year's Sixth Man of the Year odds and try to find the best value on the betting market. We'll break the candidates into three tiers: the favorites (those with odds of +1500 or shorter), the middle of the pack (those with odds between +1500 and +3000), and the long shots (those with odds longer than +3000). My immediate issue with a few of the players in this tier? I'm not sure which of them are going to qualify as reserves. De'Andre Hunter came off of the bench for Cleveland last year, yes, but with Max Strus set to miss the first few months of the season, I can't say for certain whether or not he will remain there. I'm not laying +950 favorite money for a player who may not even be eligible for the award. Anfernee Simons at +1500 poses similar issues. Boston is in such a state of flux that I can't say with much confidence who I expect to start for them or how they will respond to injuries as the season progresses. Shaedon Sharpe (+1500) has reportedly been a camp standout, so I'd expect him to eventually start as well. That's a long-term fear I have for Naz Reid. Teams rarely hand out $125 million contracts to players they perceive as reserves. In the short term, though, I'm reasonably confident he won't start for the Timberwolves , so +1000 is a fair price for the best reserve big man in the NBA . Yes, this is a guard-dominated award, but that almost gives Reid the advantage of being distinct. It's easier for him to stand out in this crowd, and we obviously know he's capable of winning the award because he's already done it. Jordan Clarkson (+1500) will absolutely be a reserve. He's just in a too many cooks situation. Aside from the fact that he won't be the most prominent New York reserve (or even the second-most prominent, as two of Josh Hart , Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride will come off of the bench), the Knicks are also expected to place more of an emphasis on using deep-bench players for lineup experimentation this season. Couple that with his injuries over the past few years and he's just not a very likely choice. This makes Reid the only worthwhile bet in this value tier. There are players in this tier that make iffy bets because they, too, are possible starters. The difference is that the odds are so much longer that you can justify the risk. Take last year's winner. Payton Pritchard is available at +3000 at BetMGM . I suspect Boston will start him. However, if they're comfortable with the role he excelled in a year ago and want to start Simons for the sake of boosting his trade value, the 30-to-1 line on Pritchard is a solid value swing. Reed Sheppard is in a somewhat similar boat. I ultimately expect him to earn a starting job in Houston, but I'm not sure that's an opening night move for Houston. At +2200, he's worth a swing, especially if you're using a book that offers good value on cash outs in case it later looks like he'll get moved into the starting lineup. The season is still a ways away, so in cases like these, it can be useful to monitor the preseason and make a more informed choice closer to the start of the season. There are two names in this group that I suspect are simply on teams with too much talent for them to win. Jared McCain (+2700) and John Collins (+2000) could certainly be the best bench players in the NBA , but will they shoot enough? McCain shares a position with Quentin Grimes and VJ Edgecombe , and we haven't even mentioned the three former All-Stars in Philadelphia's starting five. Collins shares a bench with several All-Stars. Will it be easy for him to stand out next to Chris Paul , Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez ? My favorite pick in this group is probably the player with the shortest odds. I'm reasonably confident Ty Jerome (+1600) will be a full-time reserve. His health issues make it unlikely that the Grizzlies would ever start him. But Memphis has always been great at cultivating depth and empowering reserves. He was probably the best per-minute reserve last season, but he didn't play as much as Pritchard or Malik Beasley. The Grizzlies may not be obvious title contenders, but they should be a solidly competitive team. Ja Morant missing games and Desmond Bane playing for the Magic should give him plenty of opportunities for statistical showcases. There are four specific players I want to point toward here, but then a broader situation to monitor: And then there's Portland. The Blazers are trying to be relatively competitive this season. They also have too many players for too few jobs. Donovan Clingan will presumably be the center. That leaves four slots for Deni Avdija , Jrue Holiday , Shaedon Sharpe, Scoot Henderson and Toumani Camara (without even mentioning Jerami Grant , who has simply aged beyond being a starting-caliber player). Keep an eye on Portland. If you think you have a handle on which of those players will come off of the bench most of the season, any are at least worth a look. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

It feels a bit like 2021-22 for the Golden State Warriors , doesn't it? They made significant additions a roster that looked formidable down the stretch last season, but they've been largely dismissed as a championship contender: Six teams have better odds to come out of the Western Conference. The Warriors' stars have heard people say that their championship window has closed, and they strongly disagree. \"We're going to have to go out there and produce and get it done,\" Jimmy Butler said at media day . \"We know that. But we're just so joyful. We're so happy to be able to compete with one another and do what they set out to do, do what I want to do for the first time: win a championship. And I smile knowing that it's a really great chance for us.\" In 2025-26, though, Stephen Curry will turn 38, not 34, and Draymond Green will turn 36, not 32. Butler, who gave the Warriors new life in February, is 36. Their biggest signing, Al Horford , is 39. The NBA season is grueling, and Golden State coach Steve Kerr himself is on record saying that younger players are more likely to be able to handle the style of play and the schedule. (The reigning champs had an average age of 25.1 years, weighted by regular-season minutes.) With Butler and Horford in the equation, the Warriors might actually have a more balanced, well-rounded team than they did when they won the title four years ago, but Father Time will be tougher to beat this time. Last year: The Warriors won 12 of their first 15 games, but the start didn't prove to be sustainable. De'Anthony Melton won the starting shooting guard spot early in the season and almost immediately tore his ACL. They were 14-10 when they traded Melton and some draft capital to Brooklyn for Dennis Schröder in mid-December, and they were 25-24 when, before a game in Utah, they agreed to trade Andrew Wiggins , Schröder, Kyle Anderson , Lindy Waters III and a protected 2025 first-round pick (which later became Kasparas Jakučionis) for Butler. From Butler's debut onward, the Warriors went 23-8 with the league's best defense and a plus-9.2 net rating, but their 48-34 record was not good enough to secure a top-six seed. They beat the Grizzlies the play-in, won an extraordinarily physical seven-game series against the second-seeded Houston Rockets and advanced to play the Timberwolves in the second round. Despite Curry straining his hamstring in the first half, they won the opener in Minnesota, too. Without their franchise player, though, they lost the next four games. The offseason: Almost nothing Golden State did in the offseason was official until Oct. 1, as a long stalemate with restricted free agent forward Jonathan Kuminga put the team in a holding pattern. Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, discussed the details of the negotiations on an episode of ESPN's \"The Hoop Collective\" before the 23-year-old forward agreed to a two-year, $46.8 million deal with a team option. After that became official, the Warriors signed Horford for the taxpayer midlevel (two years, $11.7 million, player option) and signed Melton and Seth Curry to minimum deals. They also re-signed Gary Payton II for the minimum. Las Vegas over/under: 45.5, per BetMGM Warriors believer: If you spent more time this offseason thinking about Jonathan Kuminga's contract negotiations than what Al Horford will do for the Warriors, you're going to be shocked by how awesome this team is. The only bad thing about the Horford signing is that it didn't happen years ago. They wouldn't have won in 2022 without Otto Porter and Nemanja Bjelica , but even then they were sacrificing size to get enough spacing on the floor. Imagine how much simpler lineup construction would have been for the last couple of seasons if the team had a stretch big who was a plus defender. The collective intelligence of Golden State's new starting lineup is off the charts, and Horford is the sort of guy who amplifies everyone around him without taking anything off the table. I'm psyched to watch every single game the Warriors play. Warriors skeptic: You're right about one thing: Horford could have helped the Warriors years ago. Doesn't it scare you, though, that they're betting so heavily on his body holding up now ? His lateral quickness is impressive for someone his age, but it gets a bit worse every year. I assume Golden State will moderate his minutes and sit him for half of every back-to-back, like Boston did last season. This is smart! It also limits his regular-season impact. To me, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue: To compete for a championship, they need to avoid running their vets into the ground during the regular season, but they also need to enter the playoffs with a high seed. These goals are in direct conflict with each other. Warriors believer: Are they? I'd argue that the best way to moderate your best players' minutes is to absolutely dominate when they're all on the floor. Look at OKC's minutes distribution last season or the Warriors' in 2017 and 2018 -- that's what happens when you can routinely sit your starters for the entire fourth quarter. Also, don't forget that Golden State was an elite team before it signed Horford and De'Anthony Melton. If Horford doesn't play back-to-backs, then it can just go back to the Draymond-at-5 look that has worked forever. I admit that the Warriors aren't quite as deep as the Thunder or Clippers , but it's not like they're super top-heavy. Trayce Jackson-Davis and Quinten Post are still in the picture, and Steve Kerr has an abundance of rotation-caliber wings to choose from. Warriors skeptic: The Clippers are an interesting point of comparison, actually, because they're the only other team that has gone all-in on old dudes. That team is so deep that Chris Paul might get DNP-CDs, and I'd be much less worried about Horford if he were playing the same role as Brook Lopez this season. Anyway, the Warriors will probably look like the amazing team you're envisioning at times. I don't know how often it'll happen, though. As awesome as Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green still are, having them all on the same team presents challenges. One is the simple question of availability, and the second is making the pieces fit around them. Horford helps, but if he's resting, then Kuminga's role immediately becomes more complicated, for example. Melton also helps, in theory, but he's coming off ACL surgery and hasn't even practiced yet. Warriors believer: Again, you're forgetting that, until Steph got hurt against Minnesota, the Warriors were already looking legit. I can't wait to see Melton with this new version of the team -- it was obvious early last season that he was a great fit -- but I also can't wait to see Brandin Podziemski take charges, Buddy Hield make 3s off movement, Gary Payton II harass opposing ballhandlers and Moses Moody reestablish himself as a reliable glue guy (after a thumb injury that limited him late last season). And if you're so concerned about the vets' availability, then you should be thrilled for the Warriors that they managed to keep Kuminga around on their terms. His athleticism and rim pressure will be useful off the bench and vital whenever Steph, Jimmy or Draymond is out. Warriors skeptic: Sigh. Kuminga. Going into the offseason, I really thought we'd seen the last of him in a Warriors uniform. You can praise their front office for winning the negotiation, I guess, but they are once again in a weird place with him. Do they try to feature him on offense to raise his trade value? Do they continue to try to make him a more Warriors-y role player? Unless he shows immense improvement as a shooter and decision-maker, a mid-January trade seems like the best-case scenario, but I doubt the offers at that point will be much more appealing than the ones Golden State rejected recently. This is a real shame, since the roster isn't quite good enough as-is and it doesn't have many trade chips left. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . When the Aces took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, it looked like they were going to walk to a 3-0 series lead. Then the Mercury started to rise as they got hot and tied the game at 88 with under a minute remaining. That's when A'ja Wilson came up with the clincher in a 90-88 win . As our own Jack Maloney notes, even before last night, Wilson had a terrific case as the WNBA's G.O.A.T. The one thing she lacked was a signature moment. Not anymore . Cross \"signature moment\" off the legacy to-do list. After an incredible 34-point performance from Wilson, a new WNBA Finals career high, she is one win away from adding another ring to her résumé. On the other side, the Mercury have made it clear they won't go down without a fight , but they might be stepping into the ring with one hand tied behind their back in Game 4. Satou Sabally left Game 3 with a head injury , and she is still being evaluated for a concussion. For the first time in almost 10 years, the Blue Jays are in the ALCS after defeating the Yankees 5-2 in Game 4. It was a team effort for Toronto as eight different pitchers combined to hold New York to two runs on six hits. As for the Blue Jays' bats, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. just kept tormenting the Yankees as he drove in the game's first run with a single in the first inning. That was Guerrero's ninth RBI of the series, and if there's any consolation for the Yankees, it's that they held him to just one RBI this time. The Blue Jays will now move on to play the winner of the series between the Mariners and Tigers, which will moves back to Seattle for Game 5 Friday after Detroit's 9-3 win Thursday night . As for the Yankees, where do they turn now after a step backward ? New York has become a model of stability with Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone leading the way for the last nine years. Given the Yankees' consistent postseason struggles against equal competition, Mike Axisa wonders if the team should bring back some of that Steinbrenner-esque rashness . Now, with the Yankees in the midst of the second-longest World Series drought in team history, what can be done this offseason to get them over the hump in 2026? The biggest game of an exciting Week 7 college football slate will be played in Eugene this weekend as No. 3 Oregon hosts No. 7 Indiana . While this may not be your father's traditional Big Ten showdown, make no mistake about it: the Ducks and Hoosiers are absolutely two of the College Football Playoff frontrunners, and they both have special talent. Our own Cooper Petagna broke down which team has the edge at each position , and all eyes are on the quarterbacks in this one. Dante Moore (Oregon) and Fernando Mendoza (Indiana) are both in the Heisman Trophy mix -- and in the top 10 of Mike Renner's updated 2026 NFL Draft big board . But which one will give his team an advantage in Autzen Stadium on Saturday? Petagna leans toward Mendoza. Indiana already asserted itself as an up-and-coming college football threat last season, but as our own John Talty points out, nothing would say more than rolling into Oregon and taking down a top-five team . If you're wondering where to see this battle of the college football titans, I have good news for you. Just turn your television dials to CBS at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon. ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Phillies at Dodgers , 6 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏈 Louisiana Tech at Kennesaw State , 7 p.m. on ESPNU 🏒 Devils at Hurricanes , 7 p.m. on Hulu 🏈 East Carolina at Tulane , 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏈 Jacksonville State at Sam Houston , 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network 🏈 Southern Miss at Georgia Southern , 8 p.m. on ESPN2 🏈 Eagles at Giants , 8:15 p.m. on Prime Video ⚾ NLDS Game 4: Brewers at Cubs , 9 p.m. on TBS/truTV 🏒 Golden Knights at Sharks , 10 p.m. on Hulu © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Kevin Durant made his Rockets debut on Wednesday night and he looked ... well ... like Kevin Durant, finishing with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes as Houston defeated the Jazz , 140-127. Durant missed his first three shots. Not to worry. He made his next seven and closed his night with 12 third-quarter points. His first bucket as a Rocket was the elbow pull-up we've seen him make thousands of times. KD's first Rockets bucket! ✅ pic.twitter.com/u4YxwwEUsW There isn't too much to say about Durant. He did his normal thing. He looked exceedingly comfortable playing with his new teammates, and why wouldn't he? This is one of the most malleable superstars the NBA has ever seen. He fits anywhere. With anyone. But this particular combination of teammates in Houston is super intriguing for the different things they all bring to the table, notably what looks like the NBA's newest Big 3 in Durant, Alperen Sengun and Amen Thompson . Kevin Durant tonight: 20 PTS - 7/10 FGM - 5/5 FTM - 23 MIN Amen Thompson tonight: 19 PTS - 7 REB - 6 AST - 2 STL - 25 MIN Alperen Sengun tonight: 13 PTS - 13 AST - 5 REB - 4 STL - 28 MIN Houston’s Big 3 is just getting started. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/HNePrQdCnb Do the math, and that's a combined 52 points, 20 assists and and 14 rebounds on the night. Barring injury, all three of these guys could be All-Stars. But again, more than that, it's about all the different things they do. This isn't a situation like Durant and Kyrie Irving or James Harden or Devin Booker , where they are all, for the most part, on-ball scorers who occupy similar areas of the floor. Thompson, the all-world athlete and perhaps the most uniquely gifted player the league has seen since young Ben Simmons , is nothing like Durant, who in turn is nothing like Sengun -- something of a Nikola Jokić lite. With Sengun's ability to handle the ball and orchestrate offense from any spot on the floor, the pick-your-poison two-man actions with Durant stand to be deadly. What are you supposed to do when Sengun is backing you down in the post with Durant one pass away? Play Sengun one-on-one and he cooks. Double down on Sengun, and he kicks to Durant for the jumper. Cover them both, and Thompson cuts down the lane while your collective attention is understandably distracted. Kevin Durant one pass away on a Sengun post up. Gives Sengun so much more space to operate than he had last year. Also a very fun pass. Sengun is gonna fully break out this year in my opinion. pic.twitter.com/PADTIyAAUm More Durant and Sengun: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun two man game, leads to a Durant dunk pic.twitter.com/OYwWuQYFN0 And one more: Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun working the 2-man game to perfection as KD gets the and-1 bucket 🤝 pic.twitter.com/WqnotphPyo Sengun has racked up 32 points and 19 assists through 45 minutes of preseason action so far after opening a lot of eyes at FIBA EuroBasket this summer. He could be in line for a monster season, particularly as a facilitator, with Durant occupying so much attention and a bunch of long athletes exposing the cracks these two will create. Meanwhile, Thompson, who now has 30 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, four steals and a block through two preseason outings, is going to be doing things like this on the defensive end and in the open floor. Amen Thompson is EVERYWHERE. 19p/6r/4a/2s for Houston... at halftime 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BkVkxcCkTS So, get ready Rockets fans. The Fred VanVleet injury sucks, but this team is still ready for liftoff on the strength of this sensational trio, a still-stout defense, tons of size, and elite coaching in Ime Udoka. We got a look at all those things in Durant's debut on Wednesday. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The Golden State Warriors may not be at the height of their dynasty days when they won four championships in eight years, but they're still a team that people would rather avoid in the postseason. We saw last season how true that is, as they knocked out the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Golden State gave the Rockets trouble despite having to build chemistry on the fly with Jimmy Butler , who was acquired just two months before the playoffs started. Now with the benefit of a full offseason and training camp together, Draymond Green feels the Warriors are better positioned to contend this year. \"We think we're even in a better position now to win a championship than we were last year,\" Green told ESPN . \"Last year, Jimmy didn't even know any defensive terminologies, we were just making it work. So I think we actually have an opportunity to build this thing the right way, and work towards a championship the way you have to do it.\" The Warriors spent most of the offseason in a contract stalemate with Jonathan Kuminga , but managed to come to an agreement at the buzzer to a new two-year, $46.8 million deal. They also added veteran big man Al Horford , as well as Seth Curry and De'Anthony Melton . Horford's presence has already been a revelation for Golden State, as his instant chemistry with Stephen Curry has been on full display in the preseason . Seth Curry and Melton will give Golden State more depth. And with the trio of Stephen Curry, Green and Butler still at the center, the Warriors are a team that shouldn't be overlooked, even in a loaded Western Conference. \"I think if we stay healthy, I don't see any team out there that we can't beat,\" Green said. Health will certainly be top of mind for the Warriors, especially after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Timberwolves, forcing him to miss the last four games of that series. Butler also missed time in the first round with a pelvic contusion, though he was only sidelined for one game. The Warriors, who have +2700 odds to win the championship at FanDuel , will need both to stay healthy in order to make any sort of serious run in the postseason. If they are, it's pretty difficult to bet against a clutch duo like Butler and Curry, and the championship experience of Green and coach Steve Kerr calling the shots on the sideline. The Warriors will open their season on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This week brought another round of Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors, with reports that the Bucks and Knicks discussed potential trade options for the former two-time MVP. Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \" six, seven months \" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. \"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\" This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

With less than two weeks until the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, Russell Westbrook is still a free agent. Despite the Sacramento Kings reportedly being among the teams that showed interest in the former league MVP earlier this offseason, it appears Westbrook will not be on a team for the start of the season. One possibility for Westbrook could be a reunion with his former team, the Houston Rockets . Westbrook joining Houston -- a team with a clear need for a veteran point guard after Fred VanVleet suffered a torn ACL last month -- would also reunite him with his former teammate with the Oklahoma City Thunder , Kevin Durant . On the \"Up & Adams\" show on Wednesday , Durant opened up about the possibility of reuniting with his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. \"Russ is a legend,\" Durant said. \"I think he deserves to be in the NBA right now. I think he deserves to walk out of the NBA on his own terms. Yeah, (a reunion) would be dope. But it's not my decision. Leaving that up to whoever makes those decisions for now.\" Durant, who joined Houston this offseason via trade from the Phoenix Suns , had a high-profile breakup with Oklahoma City in 2016 when he joined the Golden State Warriors as a free agent. Durant and Westbrook were teammates for eight seasons with Oklahoma City and reached the NBA Finals during the 2011-12 season. Since Westbrook was traded from Oklahoma City to Houston in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets . Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver. Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Houston pushed its chips to the table this offseason by acquiring Durant from Phoenix. Although the Rockets didn't mortgage their entire future to land the former league MVP, it was a clear move designed to raise the ceiling of a team that lost in the first round of last season's playoffs in seven games to the Warriors. With VanVleet likely out for the entire season, Houston has a decision to make about its starting lineup. Durant, Amen Thompson , Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Şengün will all more than likely be in the lineup on opening night. However, the fifth and final spot could be up in the air. Houston could slide Thompson to handle more of the point guard duties, which means another spot in the lineup -- presumably for Dorian Finney-Smith or Tari Eason -- could be available. It's also worth noting that Houston coach Ime Udoka rolled out a double-big lineup with Şengün and Steven Adams at times last season. The Rockets also added Clint Capela this offseason, and he's expected to be in the rotation. However, the more likely option will be that Houston starts former No. 3 overall pick Reed Sheppard at point guard. Sheppard, who appeared in just 52 regular-season games during the 2024-25 campaign and also spent time in the G League, could be a breakout candidate during his second NBA season. With VanVleet out, Sheppard's timeline and development could get sped up. Adding Westbrook would allow Houston to ease Sheppard into a more prominent role. Westbrook has been primarily coming off the bench the last few seasons of his career, so it's still likely Houston could roll with Sheppard as the starting point guard even if Westbrook were added. The more logical option is that Houston doesn't add Westbrook and enters the season with what it has. Losing VanVleet is a major blow for Houston's title hopes, but with a Year 2 jump from Sheppard coupled with Thompson playing more on the ball, the Rockets will be fine with or without Westbrook. The bottom line is that a reunion between Durant and Westbrook would be nostalgic for plenty of basketball fans and something that seemed almost impossible years ago when the former OKC star left in free agency nine years ago. If Durant is open to the reunion, it's something Houston should (at least) think about. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Allen Iverson shared his list of the top five NBA players of all time this week, and he included a few obvious choices along with one surprise. A Hall of Famer and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Iverson's list included three fellow guards. It also included the NBA's all-time leading scorer and arguably the game's most dominant inside presence since Wilt Chamberlain. \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James , Steph Curry , Shaquille O'Neal,\" Iverson told CBS News . Iverson's inclusions of Jordan and James are no-brainers as they are universally considered as arguably the greatest basketball players of all-time. Bryant is also not terribly surprising as was one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. Bryant was also a five-time NBA champion who won one of his titles at Iverson's expense. Speaking of that, Bryant's former teammate, O'Neal, may have played the biggest role in Iverson falling short of winning an NBA title. After Iverson dropped 48 points in the 76ers ' upset of the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, O'Neal (who had 44 points and 20 rebounds in Los Angeles' Game 1 loss) responded with another dominant performance in an NBA Finals series. The reigning league and NBA Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game while leading the Lakers to four straight wins en route to the Lakers' second consecutive title. O'Neal and Bryant (who averaged 24.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.4 steals) did enough to hold off the 76ers and Iverson, who in defeat averaged a series-best 35.6 points per game. Allen Iverson battled tough against the Lakers in Game 4 of the NBA Finals! (2001) 35 PTS 4 AST 4 REB 1 STL pic.twitter.com/urPeKo0mO4 Curry may be Iverson's most surprising inclusion in that he is rarely mentioned in such conversations. That being said, Curry has a pretty good argument to be in those talks as he changed the way the game is played. The NBA's career leader in 3-point makes, Curry has made 3-point shooting a much more frequent shot option. A generation of future players grew up watching and wanting to emulate Curry's jaw-dropping 3-points shots. The result has been a game-changer for the NBA, as 3-point shots are being being attempted at a record pace. On top of that, Curry was also the leader of the NBA's greatest dynasty since the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs . From 2025-22, Curry led the Warriors to four NBA titles and six NBA Finals appearances that included five straight from 2015-19. As far as individual awards are concerned, Curry is two-time league MVP. He won his coveted NBA Finals MVP after leading Golden State to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 2022 Finals. Curry's unique style clearly inspired a general of younger players who wanted to be like him. His style has also been lauded by many former players, Iverson included. \"Never seen anything like it in my life,\" Iverson said of Curry, who will begin his 17th regular season when the Warriors face the Lakers in Los Angeles on Oct. 21. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

{"source": "rss", "feed": "https://www.cbssports.com/rss/headlines/nba/", "title": "The Conversation: How much better did Luka Dončić's Lakers get?", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-how-much-better-did-luka-doncics-lakers-get/", "published_at": "2025-10-08T15:52:35+00:00", "domain": "cbssports.com", "summary": "We're previewing the 2025-26 Los Angeles Lakers, who are in transition", "body": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the first round of last year's playoffs, the Minnesota Timberwolves pushed the Los Angeles Lakers around. The Lakers' thin frontcourt rotation was exposed, as was their overall lack of depth. In Game 4, they played the same five-man unit for the entire second half. Their base defense didn't hold up, and blitzing Anthony Edwards didn't work, either. They got stuck in the mud on offense, particularly late in games. Looking back in late September , coach JJ Redick said they weren't physically ready to play. Can the Lakers avoid the same fate in 2025-26? Well, Luka Dončić seems to have addressed his much-discussed conditioning issues, and Redick plans to prep them for the postseason differently. Their rotation will be different, but not radically so: Deandre Ayton , Marcus Smart and Jake LaRavia have arrived, and Dorian Finney-Smith 's tenure ended just six months after it began. In Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves , they have a ton of playmaking at their disposal, but they don't have much of an identity beyond that. This time around, though, they have a full season to build something sturdier on that foundation. Last year: The Lakers were 13-12 in mid-December, but had improved to 28-19 by the time that they pulled off perhaps the single greatest trade in NBA history. On the first day of February, they sent Anthony Davis , Max Christie , Jalen Hood-Schifino , a 2029 first-round pick and what turned out to be the No. 53 pick in the 2025 draft to Dallas for Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris . Dončić was hurt at the time, and the Lakers ramped him up cautiously. Despite this, and despite James missing two weeks in March with a groin injury, they finished 50-32 and third in the Western Conference. They definitely did not look like the higher seed in their series against Minnesota, however. The offseason: The Lakers didn't offer James a contract extension, and, when he picked up his $52.6 million player option, Rich Paul released a statement to ESPN that made his future with the franchise seem uncertain. Dončić's future with the franchise, though, became much more secure: As soon as he was allowed to sign an extension, he did -- it's a three-year max deal with a player option, meaning the earliest he could hit free agency is 2028. After Portland bought out the remainder of Ayton's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $16.2 million deal (with a player option). After Washington bought out the remainder of Smart's contract, the Lakers signed him to a two-year, $10.5 million deal (with a player option). And after Finney-Smith committed to sign with Houston, the Lakers picked up LaRavia on a two-year, $12 million deal. They also re-signed Jaxson Hayes for the minimum and, surprisingly, waived Jordan Goodwin (to facilitate the Smart signing). Las Vegas over/under: 48.5 wins, per BetMGM Lakers believer: Get ready for the coronation of Luka Dončić. He's in championship shape , just like JJ Redick and the rest of the world wanted, and this is his time to win his first MVP award. Eight months later, I still can't believe the Mavericks actually traded him, but it has clearly given the Lakers new life. Over the summer, LeBron shot a ton of catch-and-shoot 3s because he wanted to be ready for his first full season playing with Luka. It's funny how, when you have two of the best playmakers of all-time on your roster, a starting-caliber center like Deandre Ayton can just fall out of the sky. Ayton knows this is the biggest opportunity of his career , so he'll play with force on both ends. As long as the Lakers get decent bench production, they'll be contenders. Lakers skeptic: I can't believe the Mavs traded Dončić, either! Bad news, though: The Lakers are still at least a couple of pieces away from contention. Losing Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency was a big blow, especially because this roster is short on reliable role players. Sure, I've seen Ayton, Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent , Jarred Vanderbilt and Maxi Kleber be productive in the past, but recent history suggests it's dangerous to count on them. LaRavia is a downgrade from DFS, Smart could turn out to be a downgrade from Goodwin and Ayton is obviously going to drive Redick crazy. There's a reason that, when asked what Ayton would bring to LA , all former teammate Devin Booker said was, \"I mean, I guess we'll just have to see, you know? Yeah.\" Lakers believer: I mean, I guess we'll see then! Ayton is saying all the right things , though, and Luka is going to make his job extremely simple. He's not be the prototypical shot-blocking, hard-rolling big man Dončić thrived with in Dallas, but neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford has Ayton's touch from floater range. His contract is a bargain, and the Lakers got good value in free agency in general. LaRavia is exactly the type of connector that they needed on offense, and he's almost a decade younger than Finney-Smith. Smart is an upside play: You accept the injury risk because otherwise there's no way you could grab an elite defender who can make plays with the biannual exception. Speaking of injury risk, please apologize to Vincent! That man played in 72 games last season, made 37.2% of his catch-and-shoot 3s and competed defensively all year long. Lakers skeptic: Am I supposed to apologize for remembering that the 2023-24 season happened? Moving on: I'm curious what you think would constitute a successful season for the Lakers. To me, it's a bit tricky. James is always in win-now mode, obviously, and we've already seen Dončić take teams deep into the playoffs, so my initial instinct is to hold them to a high standard. When I really think about the roster, though, I'm not sure this team is meaningfully better than it was when it lost in five games to the Timberwolves in the first round a few months ago. Realistically, the Lakers should be happy if they can get solid production out of Ayton and if lineups featuring Dončić, James and Austin Reaves are a lot better than they were last year. Winning more than 50 games would be a nice bonus. Lakers believer: You need to think bigger. If Luka could take the 2024 Mavs to the NBA Finals, why can't he lead this team to at least the conference finals? The Thunder 's defense and depth put them in a tier of their own, but, especially after the Fred VanVleet injury, I don't think the rest of the West is that scary. By the way, don't pay read too much into the Lakers' stats with the Luka-LeBron-Reaves trio on the court last season -- they had horrible 3-point luck, and the sample was pretty small. Lakers skeptic: I think you need to think bigger, in terms of what this season actually means for the Lakers. James will be 41 in December, and, regardless of whether or not this is his final year, the front office is already trying to position itself to find Dončić's next co-star . This summer, that meant staying flexible; instead of trading future picks to maximize their chances of competing for a title in 2025-26, they signed three role players to two-year contracts and let Finney-Smith walk (because he wasn't interested in their two-year offer). You're severely underestimating the Nuggets and you're shortchanging the Timberwolves, Warriors and Clippers , but I think the biggest mistake you're making is overestimating how much this season really matters to the Lakers. They'd like to win every game they play, sure, but the bigger-picture goal is to build something new and sustainable around the 26-year-old face of the franchise. This is perfectly reasonable! It's also the reason that they're not nearly as deep as they'd need to be to compete for a title right now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

When we covered Defensive Player of the Year odds , we dived into why making a minus-money bet before the season even begins is unwise. Yes, Victor Wembanyama is probably going to win the award, but the value there just isn't worthwhile. There's far more risk than reward at a minus-money price. Well, here we have yet another award with a minus-money favorite. The longest odds you can find on Cooper Flagg right now to win 2025-26 NBA Rookie of the Year are -175 at DraftKings . Yet there are three critical differences between Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year that actually make Flagg a reasonable bet: So while I could not endorse a Wembanyama Defensive Player of the Year bet, I think Flagg is at least a reasonable choice. He will be practically everyone's pick, including mine, so if you're going to bet on this award, you're probably just looking for valuable places to hedge. So where will you find them? Again, think of what we just covered. You're not looking for subtle, valuable role players on good teams. You're looking for players who will put up big numbers. Putting up big numbers as a rookie usually means playing on a bad team willing to let you make mistakes in the name of growth. We're not going to bother dividing into tiers this time because the pool is so small and there are so few realistic candidates. Instead, we'll simply go through the notable names and determine who is and is not a viable bet at the odds currently available. The other player projected as a likely future star in the 2025 NBA Draft was Dylan Harper . He can be found at +1200 on BetMGM right now, and that is frankly a sucker's bet. He shares a backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle. Devin Vassell takes a lot of shots. Wembanyama uses far more possessions than the average center. Harper just isn't going to have the ball enough to seriously compete for a stats-based award. That he's also recovering from a thumb injury is just the icing on this disappointing cake. Harper is going to be a great NBA player. He is not going to win Rookie of the Year. It's a similar story for No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe , available at +1000 at multiple books. He was great at Summer League. He's supposedly looked great at camp. He is also, at best, fourth in the pecking order offensively for Philadelphia, and could potentially be the No. 3 player at his own position with Jared McCain returning and Quentin Grimes playing for a contract. If Edgecombe is a winning player as a rookie, that's an enormous win for Philadelphia. It just doesn't mean he's likely to put up Rookie of the Year numbers. Ok, so the No. 2 and No. 3 picks are out. Where can we find value in the lottery? At picks No. 4, 5 and 6. Tre Johnson is available at +1200 at DraftKings. Ace Bailey is available at +1800 on Caesars. Kon Knueppel has the longest odds of the trio at +2800. He is the least interesting of the three just considering the presence of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller , not to mention older ball-handlers like Collin Sexton and Tre Mann . There are already quite a few cooks in that kitchen, so he's likely going to mostly be an off-ball player early on. Still, the odds are promising, and Ball and Miller both have injury histories that suggest they'll miss time and cede shots to teammates. I wouldn't be crazy about Knueppel, but he's a justifiable portfolio addition. Johnson and Bailey are going to get to take a million shots. Of the two, I'm far more interested in Johnson. High-volume 3-point shooting is far likelier to pop statistically and generate highlights than Bailey's more mid-range focused game, and while I don't expect either to be prolific playmakers early on, Johnson, just by virtue of being a guard, is probably going to have more chances to rack up assists. Bailey's teammate Walter Clayton (+4000) is similarly interesting. He's already 22, so the learning curve will be shorter for him than most rookies, and he'll have every opportunity to handle the ball early on. Go down to No. 8 and you find our first significant long shot, Egor Demin , who is available at +12500. Demin's major defect is his shooting. This is also an award that Ben Simmons won. Big ball-handlers with the passing gene often look better with NBA spacing than they do at the college level, and the Nets will be eager to let Demin cook after all of the criticism they took for picking him at No. 8. I wouldn't expect him to win, but 125-to-1 in the event that Flagg bows out of the race for any reason is a very nice flyer. He's dealing with a foot injury at the moment, though, so don't get your hopes up too quickly. And from here, we're already running out of rookies we'd expect to play enough to make a serious run at this. Derik Queen (+15000) would be very interesting in a world in which Zion Williamson were dealing with a nagging injury or potentially traded... but Williamson is still in New Orleans, and Queen is just too duplicative to put up the requisite numbers. Jeremiah Fears is too low on the New Orleans offensive pecking order. Khaman Maluach will split minutes with several other Phoenix bigs. Cedric Coward will probably play enough, but if Jaylen Wells couldn't beat Castle in a 3-and-D role for Memphis last season, it's hard to imagine Coward beating the more imposing Flagg. Kasparas Jakučionis (+6000) is the last notable name worth a look. There are going to be ball-handling opportunities early in Miami with Tyler Herro injured, and even when he comes back, this is still a pretty limited offensive roster. If he shows he can carry a meaningful load early on, Erik Spoelstra will lean on him. If nothing else, it wouldn't hurt the Heat to pump up the trade value of one of their youngsters, so if he can play, the chances will be there. Still, Flagg is the obvious favorite here. If you're betting on this award, the play might be similar to Paolo Banchero 's race during the 2022-23 season. For a variety of reasons, he was the obvious favorite. Those who bet him early obviously profited. However, surprise contenders emerged as the season progressed. It was Bennedict Mathurin early on and Jalen Williams later. If you're vigilant, you can catch candidates before the books do. Remember, there aren't going to be that many of them. Can you think of many Rookie of the Year races with four or five true candidates? It doesn't really happen. So if you want to bet Flagg, do it. He's probably going to win. Just stay alert. Someone is going to challenge him, and if you want to have the hedge, your best bet is probably to get a sense of who it will be and grab that player at +500 a month into the season rather than throwing a bunch of darts at the board now. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The New York Knicks ' coaching search following the firing of Tom Thibodeau wasn't exactly the smoothest process, but the early returns from the Mike Brown regime have given fans reason for excitement and optimism. With the necessary caveat that it's only been two preseason games, there are obvious stylistic changes on the offensive end -- an area where the team occasionally went stagnant under Thibs. While the Knicks had the fifth-best offense in the entire NBA during the 2024-25 regular season, their production dropped significantly in the playoffs -- from 117 points per 100 possessions to just under 113. When Jalen Brunson had his infrequent and brief stints on the bench during the postseason, the offense cratered to a dismal 100 points per 100 possessions, surely a factor in team president Leon Rose making the decision to part ways with Thibodeau. Enter Brown, who engineered one of the most aesthetically appealing offenses in the league with the Sacramento Kings , finishing first in offensive rating in their magical 2022-23 season. Brown got creative, using center Domantas Sabonis as a hub, surrounding him with dribble hand-off options and constant player movement. In their two preseason games in Abu Dhabi, the Knicks have already looked more dynamic and unpredictable offensively. This feels more like the type of movement and flow the New York Knicks are building towards. Wing cuts on both sides, quick decisions. pic.twitter.com/vMIgfdUq0h \"A lot more player movement, ball movement,\" Knicks guard Miles McBride said of Brown's offense on Media Day. \"Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots, which is tough down the stretch. This year, it's going to be a little more freedom with the movement and a lot of guys cutting, guys getting active.\" To McBride's point, check out this possession from last postseason, in which Brunson dribbles around for 18 seconds while the other four Knicks stand virtually motionless watching him go to work. Obviously, there was much more to Thibodeau's offense than that, but too often the Knicks relied on Brunson -- one of the league's best isolation scorers -- to create buckets entirely on his own. With players like Karl-Anthony Towns , Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby surrounding him, it only makes sense that they would share more of the offensive burden. That would not only give Brunson some much-needed relief, but it would also keep opposing defenses on their toes. \"He's starting to adjust. You can see it,\" Brown said of Brunson after the Knicks' 113-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. \"I think this is going to be good for him, because you can see how much space he has when he brings the ball.\" You can see here how Brown is attempting to empower Towns -- a 7-footer with guard skills -- to be more assertive on the perimeter, as he was at times with the Minnesota Timberwolves . This is new: KAT already got a hand off out of the corner and now plays more guard action with pinch post out of the triangle offense pic.twitter.com/g9FeboK2AH \"We're going to move him around a lot. He's not just going to play the five,\" Brown said of Towns. \"He'll be all over the floor. His ability to shoot the basketball will show because we're going to move him around.\" Brown also wants to push the pace more than the Knicks did under Thibs. Last season, New York ranked in the middle of the pack with 16 fast-break points per game. In their two preseason outings thus far, they've logged 19 and 24, respectively. Brown said he wanted his team to play even faster after the preseason opener, and he thought the pace was better in their second game. Watch here as Anunoby gets the rebound and feels Philadelphia 76ers forward Kelly Oubre Jr . on his hip. Since nobody stops him, he turns on the afterburners and gets all the way to the hoop, where he feeds Mitchell Robinson for the easy dunk. Will the newfound emphasis on pace and ball movement last throughout the season? Who knows. It might not even last until opening night. But it's clear that Brown has come in with a different offensive game plan, and that's a large reason why he was hired. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Officers were initially called out to the area to investigate a multi-vehicle crash in the northbound lanes of the 101 freeway. While investigating that crash, officers noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in one of the lanes on the freeway south of the crash. Pierce was reportedly found asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover.

Pierce was born in Oakland and played high school basketball at Inglewood. He was a standout player in high school, playing in the 1995 McDonald's All-American Game. Pierce played college basketball at Kansas before the Celtics selected him with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Pierce put together a Hall of Fame career in Boston, leading the team to a championship during his 15-year career with the Celtics. Toward the end of his career, Pierce also played for the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards before spending his final two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. Following his playing days, Pierce served as an NBA analyst at ESPN from 2017-2021. He was let go by the network after live streaming a video of a party . Pierce started working for FS1 in 2024.

Sciatica is a pain in the sciatic nerve that goes down the lower back and through the leg. James has not taken part in pre-season and missed the defeats against the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns earlier this month because of the glute nerve irritation. The American is expected to be sidelined for all five of the Lakers' games in October, including the season-opener against Golden State. James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer , has never previously missed the start of the season in his 22-year career.

Lakers star LeBron James could not take the court to begin the preseason due to a right glute issue, and apparently, the injury is more serious than initially believed. On Thursday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported that James will miss at least three to four weeks due to sciatica in his right side. Due to the timeframe, he won't be available for Opening Night for the first time in his 23-year NBA career. After failing to play at least 60 games in three consecutive seasons, James appeared in 71 and 70 games the past two. His absence opens up a spot within the Lakers' starting lineup, raising the fantasy ceilings of Austin Reaves and Deandre Ayton . Who will start with LeBron sidelined? Lakers head coach JJ Redick has multiple options at his disposal, but regardless of who he selects, that player will likely be more impactful defensively than offensively. Holdover Jarred Vanderbilt and offseason addition Marcus Smart are two possibilities, with each bringing more consistent production to the table on the defensive end of the floor. While Smart has been the better scorer of the two throughout their careers, he hasn't always been a consistent shooter. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26: LeBron James, Paolo Banchero among players to avoid in drafts Early ADP data shows that some players are potentially being overvalued by fantasy managers. Raphielle Johnson , Another option is offseason addition Jake LaRavia , who has started the Lakers' first two preseason games. While not the defender that Vanderbilt or Smart is, LaRavia's versatility makes him an intriguing deep-league option if he's allowed to start in James' place. As for the remaining starters, Luka Dončić is the Laker whose draft outlook will be impacted the least, as he already boasts a top-5 ADP. He'll have even more responsibility to begin the year, so fantasy managers who land Dončić will hope his efficiency does not take a hit with LeBron unavailable. Reaves, Ayton and Rui Hachimura should all move up draft boards, with the former being the safest option to reach for. Last season, Reaves provided fourth-round per-game value in eight- and nine-cat formats. Hachimura was a late-round option a season ago, and he remains a player who should be selected just outside the first 100 picks. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , Ayton is the wild card, especially considering his play in the Lakers' first two preseason games. After a listless effort in the team's opener, the center was better in Sunday's exhibition loss to the Warriors. The former first-overall pick doesn't lack talent, but inconsistent effort is why the Lakers signed him on a relatively cheap deal this summer. Ayton totaled 95 appearances in his two seasons with the Trail Blazers, including 40 during the 2024-25 campaign."}

This will be the first time in his 23-year career he has missed a season opener.", "body": "One of the most impressive parts of LeBron James’ career has been his durability — he has played more minutes than any player in league history. Another example, in 22 seasons, he had never missed an opening night. That changes this year. LeBron James is out with sciatica on his right side and will be re-evaluated in 3-4 weeks, the Lakers have announced. That means he is out for opening night, Oct. 21, when the Lakers host Stephen Curry and the Warriors in the second game of a double-header, the games that mark the return of the NBA to NBC and its debut on Peacock . Even the most optimistic timeline has LeBron missing the Lakers’ first six games, but with him being re-evaluated in a month expect that number to climb into the double digits at least. A return in mid-November seems more likely. One of the most well known cases of sciatica in the NBA is LeBron’s Mind the Game cohost Steve Nash. Nash’s sciatica was linked to multiple bulging discs in his back and spondylolisthesis, Sciatica is a shooting pain, often accompanied by weakness or numbness, along one side of the body due to pressure on the sciatic nerve. That nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and down the leg to the feet. That compression of the nerve can be caused by a number of things, such as a herniated disc, a bone spur, lifting something heavy incorrectly, or other issues. The treatment rarely involves surgery, but is more about rest, specific stretches and exercises (depending on the cause of the pain) and heat/ice on the affected area. LeBron, 40, was a second-team All-NBA player for the Lakers last season, averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.8 rebounds a game. The Lakers had hoped to use this year’s training camp to get LeBron and Luka Doncic more comfortable playing next to one another, but LeBron’s sciatica has put that on hold. Doncic has been a full participant in practices, Lakers coach J.J. Redick said today. A Division of NBCUniversal .

Lakers All-Star forward LeBron James will miss the season opener with what the team said was a sciatica nerve injury on his right side, the team announced after practice Thursday. The Lakers said James will be re-evaluated in approximately three to four weeks and that further updates will be provided at that time. James, who is entering an NBA-record 23rd season, was limited to mostly individual workouts while dealing with nerve irritation in the glute during training camp. He didn’t play in the Lakers’ first two preseason games. When asked about managing stars Luka Doncic and James during camp before the announcement was made about his superstar player, Lakers coach JJ Redick told the media that the 40-year-old James was “on his own timeline.” \"You gotta play the cards you're dealt,” Redick told reporters. “I know that's a cliche, but that's just reality. … No one's gotten any time with LeBron. … He hasn't been on the court with the team. So that's just reality.\" The Lakers open the regular season Oct. 21 against the Golden State Warriors, but fans won’t get to see legends James and Stephen Curry share the court together at Crypto.com Arena. The best-case scenario for James and the Lakers have him returning in three weeks, meaning he would miss the first five games and would return to play Oct. 31 at Memphis. Read more: Fan is suing LeBron James for 'fraud, deception' after Lakers star teased 'Second Decision' The four-week timeframe would have James missing the first nine games and coming back Nov. 8 at Atlanta. The last time James spoke to the media was on media day on Sept. 29 and the conversation was about his plans on retirement. He didn’t give a timeline then, mostly shrugging it off. “I don't know,” James said then. “I'm excited about today, I'm excited about an opportunity to be able to play a game that I love for another season. And whatever the journey, however the journey lays out this year, I'm just super invested, because like you just said, I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later. “So just being super appreciative of the fact that I could come up here, do another media day and talk to you guys and do all this stuff around here, so just excited about the journey and whatever this year has in store for me.” James has just one year left on his deal with the Lakers, a $52.6-million contract option that he exercised over the summer. He did not sign an extension with the Lakers, meaning that James will be a free agent when the 2025-26 season is over, free to sign with another team — or retire. James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer during the regular season with 42,184 points. He’s played the second-most regular-season games in history at 1,562, only 50 behind the leader, Robert Parish, a record James is in line to break this season — although that timeline has been pushed back because of his sciatica injury. He averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists last season, showing no signs of slowing down. “The things that still push me is the fact that the love of the game is still high,” James said on media day. “The love of the process is even higher. So that's what continues to push me to play this game. I mean, it's really that simple. Me training and working on my body and trying to get my body as close to 100% as possible every year, it's something that's like — it's a beautiful thing for me. “Just continue to challenge to see how well I can push myself to play the game at a high level, recover at a high level, be able to sleep better, mentally prepare, try to stay sharp throughout the course of a long season. And just the roller coaster of an NBA season, that's all like, gratifying to me, no matter the good, the bad, the ugly. I love that process. … So much that goes into it, more than just picking up a basketball and shooting at the rim.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

If he's re-evaluated and cleared exactly three weeks from Thursday, James would miss four more games before returning to play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 31.

[ Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed ] It's a disappointing development for James, who reportedly had a goal of playing on opening night as recently as Tuesday. James has been sidelined with what the team deemed \" nerve irritation in his glute \" since the start of training camp. The issue either didn't improve, or got worse, ahead of Thursday's announcement. Despite his age, James has been remarkably healthy over his career. While he has missed some time with the Lakers, James was able to play in 141 games with the team over the past two seasons. His career low in games played in a single season — discounting the COVID-19 year — is 55. James has been limited to that figure twice in his career, both seasons coming with the Lakers. When healthy, James has still proven to be an effective player on the court. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds. He and Luka Dončić helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has a long way to go as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury, but the early returns are promising. Tatum showed off his progress Thursday, dunking the ball just months removed from Achilles surgery. Tatum posted a video of the feat on X. For the caption, Tatum gave all the credit to his shoes. It wasn't the most mind-blowing dunk fans have seen from Tatum, but it was impressive nonetheless. Tatum is just five months removed from undergoing surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Tatum sustained the injury during the final minutes of the team's Game 4 loss to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Without Tatum, the Celtics lost the series in six games. Despite that injury, Tatum hasn't ruled out a return during the 2025-26 NBA season. If he can return to the court this season, it would be quite the accomplishment. The recovery process after an Achilles injury is long and arduous. Even if Tatum feels fine physically later in the season, there's no guarantee he would return to the court at 100% immediately. If that's the case, Tatum seemed to imply he would take the cautious route. When talking about his return in September, Tatum said he would prioritize a full recovery over coming back sooner. \"The most important thing is a full recovery,\" he said. \"And I'm not rushing it ... at all.\" When healthy, Tatum is among the best players in the NBA. After acclimating to the pros over his first two seasons, Tatum took a major step forward in Year 3. Since then, he's averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. He's made the All-NBA team five times over that period and is a six-time All-Star. The Celtics are in a bit of a transition year with Tatum sidelined to begin the season. Knowing Tatum would miss time, the Celtics focused on cutting future salary in the offseason. Three starters were shipped out in the process. While Boston still employs Derrick White and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are projected to be under-.500 this season. If that comes to pass, there's no reason for Tatum to push himself to return. If the Celtics have little to play for down the stretch, Tatum will be best served waiting until the 2026-27 NBA season to get back on the court. But if things work out better than expected and the Celtics find themselves in a surprising spot as the playoffs approach, there's at least a small possibility their best player could be back just in time for another deep playoff run. That might be unlikely, but Tatum is clearly already making big strides in his recovery."}

For the first time since the Golden State Warriors' dynasty, there will be a repeat champion in the NBA ... at least, that's what team general managers believe. The annual NBA GM survey was released Thursday, and a whopping 80% of those surveyed believe the Oklahoma City Thunder will repeat as champions. While that's a staggering number, it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. The Thunder boast an impressive young core of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. In fact, NBA GMs rate that core as the best in the league, with the team also earning a victory in that survey question. The Thunder received 50% of the vote there, with the San Antonio Spurs finishing second. With Holmgren and Williams signed to long-term deals this offseason, the Thunder should be a similar threat to win it all next season. Getting 80% of NBA GMs to agree on that topic might come as a shock, but that's typically how the survey goes. The Boston Celtics — who were coming off a championship during the 2023-24 NBA season — managed to gain 83% of the vote when GMs were asked who would win the championship ahead of last season. Those GMs were wrong, though the Celtics were once again a tough contender. If the Thunder aren't going to win it all, NBA GMs see four other teams as possible candidates to take home the Larry O'Brien trophy. Both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Denver Nuggets each received 7% of the vote. The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks also received at least one vote among GMs. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] At 30, Nuggets star Nikola Jokić might be entering the second half of his career. But NBA GMs don't expect him to lose a step this season. Jokić dominated the annual survey, finishing first in seven different questions, all of which complimented his skills. Jokić is the most likely to win the 2025-26 NBA MVP award, the player who forces opponents to make the most adjustments, the best center in the NBA, the best international player in the game, the best passer in the game and the player with the best basketball IQ, per league general managers. In addition to that, Jokić finished third in the voting for best leader and also received votes for most versatile player and player a GM would want to take a shot with the game on the line. Despite being 30, Jokić also finished third when GMs were asked what player they would choose if they were building a new franchise from scratch. San Antonio Spurs standout Victor Wembanyama easily won that category, picking up 83% of the votes. But Jokić's presence in the top 3 proves NBA GMs still think extremely highly of his game. NBA GMs chose \"roster construction\" as the one thing they would change in the league. That was a wide-ranging topic on the survey, which mentioned, \"Apron rules too harsh, Add a cap discount for own drafted players, Allow trading partial salaries, Make all minimum contracts the same\" as things GMs wanted to change. That option received 26% of the vote. Lower down the list, however, some GMs may have decided to take a shot at the Los Angeles Clippers. Five percent of GMs listed \"Higher penalties for cap circumvention\" as the biggest change they would make in the league. That desire comes amid reports suggesting the Clippers tried to circumvent the NBA salary cap when negotiating a free-agent deal with star Kawhi Leonard ahead of the 2019-20 NBA season. Both the Clippers and Leonard have denied any wrongdoing , though that didn't stop the NBA from reopening its investigation into the situation."}

Fantasy basketball drafts are in full swing. While it’s tempting to chase big names, not everyone is built for success in High Score formats . In a game where upside rules, knowing who to avoid can be just as important as finding the next breakout star. [ High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league ] Here are the frontcourt players I'm avoiding. George’s fantasy résumé used to be elite. Those days are gone. In 2024–25, George played just 41 games in his first stint with the Sixers, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. His usage rate (23.5%) was his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season. Now 35, George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this summer with no timeline determined for his return. Even when healthy, his efficiency slipped. PG's effective field goal percentage dropped to 51.4%, his lowest shooting numbers since the 2011-12 season. A couple of positives: his assist rate climbed back over 20% and he was 94th percentile in steals at his position. That said, if George isn't giving you 20+ points a night with the same level of dimes, upholding seventh-round value will be tough in High Score. 101 on the format Draft strategy In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Kawhi remains one of the league’s most efficient scorers, but efficiency holds less weight in High Score and standard points formats. Leonard appeared in 37 games, averaging 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game last season — solid output. But the Clippers’ offseason moves (specifically bringing in Bradley Beal and John Collins) signaled a shift toward preserving their stars. With added depth throughout their roster, Leonard's upside is fading, as the focus shifts to keeping him healthy for the postseason. Expect managed minutes and scheduled rest throughout the upcoming season. He's being drafted 45th overall in Yahoo leagues, which I can get behind in a 9-cat roto format, but not points or H2H category leagues. [ Draft smarter with the Yahoo Fantasy Plus Draft Kit for personalized player rankings and tap into more premium tools to give you an edge ] Allen is still valuable in category leagues for FG% and rebounding, but in formats that reward ceiling — like High Score — Allen’s consistency won't be as valuable. He was top 10 in double-doubles with an impressive 1.15 fantasy points per minute last year, but his minutes fell under 30 per game, with a decrease in rebounding and his fewest field-goal attempts per game (7.8) since 2021. The issue is role stagnation. With Evan Mobley’s usage climbing under coach Kenny Atkinson and the Cavaliers shifting to a more perimeter-oriented offense, Allen’s offensive opportunities aren't as fruitful. Allen’s consistency has become both his strength and his limitation. He's a reliable double-double threat, but if he's not blocking shots or getting over that 30-minute threshold, boom opportunities are capped. With rebounds worth less in High Score, Gobert's value continues to fall. The 12-year vet is coming off a season where his rebound rate dropped to 18.2%, his lowest in seven years and a career-low 4.1% block rate. Gobert's fantasy points per minute (0.99) fell to under 1.0 for the first time in a decade. As the Wolves’ offensive core (Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels) evolves, Gobert’s usage and effectiveness will continue trending south. He’s a classic “better in real life than fantasy” big man — a safe double-double, but one without any game-breaking upside, especially with the rim protection falling off. Moving from a losing environment to a winning one will benefit Johnson in real life. However, Johnson’s departure from Brooklyn to Denver is a downgrade for his fantasy outlook. Yes, he's now playing with the best basketball player in the world. Still, he's coming off an injury-riddled season where he put up career-highs across several categories like points, FT%, 3s made, FG% and assists per game. Then there was the 22.9 usage rate, which was also a career-best. I expect he'll maintain his efficiency, but the volume and sheer opportunity are a wrap with the Nuggets. In Denver, Johnson's role shifts dramatically, becoming a low-usage floor spacer, rather than a featured scorer. Fewer shots mean fewer spike games, and that’s detrimental in formats where ceiling outcomes give you the best opportunity to win."}

A fan who spent hundreds of dollars for tickets to what he thought would be one of LeBron James ' final NBA games is looking to recoup the money in small claims court after it turned out \"The Second Decision\" teased by the Lakers superstar had nothing to do with his retirement.

He and other basketball fans were under that impression after James posted Monday on X and Instagram that he would be announcing \"the decision of all decisions\" the next day. The post included a video clip teasing \"The Second Decision,\" a clear reference to 2010's \"The Decision,\" in which James famously announced he was going to \" take my talents to South Beach \" to play for the Miami Heat. Garcia said he purchased the tickets within 10 minutes of James' social media post. \"I was like, 'Holy s—, LeBron is going to retire! We've got to get tickets now,'\" the 29-year-old Garcia said. \"Like, literally, because if he formally makes this announcement, you know, there's gonna be some significant price changes, right?\" Read more: Shaikin: Dodgers hope a very, very rested hometown hero can pitch them into NLCS Garcia is a huge fan of the Lakers and James, as well as an avid basketball fan in general, so he thought it would be cool to see the NBA's all-time leading scorer play for the last time against the team he started his career with and brought its first title in 2016 after his return from Miami. \"Moments like that, I understand the value,\" Garcia said. \"There still may be some moderate value [to the tickets], however it's not the same without him retiring. I remember Kobe's last year, it was kind of what this would have been, per se, where every ticket was worth a lot. Every game had value. … \"I missed out on that. I was a little bit younger at the time. I obviously wasn't in a position to where I could just buy tickets unfortunately at that age. I believe I was like 18 or 19 at the time. And that's one of my biggest regrets as a sports fan. I really wish I could have gotten to Kobe's last year. So I see this as a potential to kind of make up for what I lost with Kobe.\" But \"The Second Decision\" ended up having nothing to do with retirement. It was merely a Hennessy ad . So now Garcia wants his money back.

So that's why I was really thinking, 'You know what, this might be grounds for a case.'\" A trial date has been set for Dec. 1. The Times reached out to an attorney said to be working with James related to the claim but did not receive an immediate response. Garcia apparently wasn't the only person who wanted to be sure they'd be in attendance for what they thought was about to become a James retirement tour. According to Victory Live, which analyzes verified ticket resale data across the secondary market, sales for 2025-26 Lakers home and road games were 25 times higher Monday after James' teaser post as compared to the daily average for the previous five days. Also on Monday, the average sold-ticket prices for Lakers games increased from $280 to $399. Victory Live reported that by Wednesday tickets sales and prices for Lakers games had normalized. As of Thursday afternoon, Ticketmaster's lowest price for a March 31 Cavaliers-Lakers ticket was $141. Not everyone was fooled, though. Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters at practice Tuesday that the organization hadn't been at all concerned about the meaning behind James' post the previous day.

Garcia said he didn't care what others might think about him jumping to the wrong conclusion or his effort to recoup the funds he spent after doing so. \"If I was the type of individual that was bothered by people's comments or reactions, would I have filed a small-claims lawsuit against LeBron James?\" Garcia said. \"I'm getting reactions. I mean, have you read some of these social media comments? I don't care. I am a very chill guy. ... I'm getting set to take on one of the most famous people in the world. I know what comes with that.\" In light of everything that has happened this week, though, Garcia said he'd still be willing to pay the same amount of money to see James play during his eventual retirement tour. \"Of course,\" Garcia said. \"I would probably spend more, because life is all about memories and experiences.\" Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

A contract has yet to be signed and finalized, but could be before the month is out. Tim Reynolds at the Associated Press notes any deal would have to be approved by the USA Basketball board of directors, who are set to meet later in October. Spoelstra would take over for Steve Kerr, who stepped away after the team won gold at the Paris Olympics, the fifth consecutive gold medal for the American men’s team. Spoelstra served as an assistant coach on Kerr’s staff in Paris and at the World Cup before that. Spoelstra had said previously he would be honored to be considered for the job, and he would be the first Heat coach ever to hold the position. Entering his 18th NBA season, Spoelstra is the longest-tenured head coach in the NBA (by six years, Kerr is the second-longest tenured). Spoelstra was just voted the “best coach in the NBA” in the annual poll of general managers, who also said he is the best manager and motivator of players in the league. Spoelstra has led the Heat to six NBA Finals appearances, winning two (with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) in 2012 and 2013. USA Basketball has to select a coach who elite players want to play for, someone the game’s best are willing to spend their summer in a gym with (spending less time with family and friends). Someone above the petty fray of agents and shoe politics that can try to influence decisions. Spoelstra fits that mold, he is highly respected by players.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 24-58 (13th in the East, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 111.0 (23rd) Defensive rating : 117.3 (26th) Additions: Trendon Watford, VJ Edgecombe, Johni Broome, Dominick Barlow, Jabari Walker, Hunter Sallis Subtractions: Guerschon Yabusele, Ricky Council IV, Lonnie Walker IV, Jared Butler, Alex Reese, Marcus Bagley, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Isaiah Mobley, Jeff Dowtin Jr. Complete roster After a 2024 offseason that led to no shortage of excitement about the prospects of Philly finally breaking through for a deep playoff run, significant injuries to franchise cornerstone Joel Embiid, max-salaried missing piece Paul George and rising-star guard Tyrese Maxey effectively scuttled the season before it ever even got out of the starting blocks. As Tom Haberstroh and I covered on The Big Number this summer , the Sixers had Embiid, George and Maxey together for just 15 games last season; that trio and Rookie of the Year candidate Jared McCain suited up together only three times in the entire 82-game set. All told, no NBA team lost more games to injury last season than the Sixers, according to Spotrac — the primary reason why a Philadelphia squad that began last season with the third-best odds of winning the East wound up sputtering toward the bottom of the conference and picking third in the 2025 NBA Draft. The hope: After a long, restful, restorative, prosperous offseason, the Sixers’ main dudes would be ready to hit the ground running and resume their regularly scheduled pursuit of the Eastern Conference finals, already in progress. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] That, um, hasn’t happened quite yet! George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in July and remains limited to individual workouts. McCain tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the thumb on his shooting hand in late September, putting him on the shelf through at least early November . And while recent videos of Embiid working out without a knee brace following his own arthroscopic surgery sent hearts soaring across the City of Brotherly Love, the big fella reportedly still has some “boxes that need to be checked” before we can start circling prospective return-to-play dates on the calendar. The team we’ve all been waiting to see … well, we might have to wait at least a while longer to see it. The glass-half-full take: The Sixers have been busy during that downtime. Embiid returned from the offseason noticeably slimmer, and while nobody’s putting a timetable yet on when to expect him back on the floor, he continues to say he’s feeling good and making progress , all while actively returning to full-court 5-on-5 scrimmaging with the team. And VJ Edgecombe, June’s third overall pick and the fruit of the disastrous 2024-25 campaign, continues to elicit raised eyebrows and effusive praise with his nuclear athleticism and seemingly-ahead-of-schedule playmaking chops. Sixers head coach Nick Nurse sure seems to like the look of the Edgecombe-Maxey backcourt — perhaps to the point of starting the two lightning-quick guards together. Perhaps, even, to the point of rolling out a three-guard alignment featuring the just-re-signed Quentin Grimes , who, upon arriving in a midseason trade from Dallas to find a hollowed-out crater where a basketball team was supposed to be, balled the hell out: 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 33.7 minutes per game, shooting 56% on 2-pointers and 37% on nearly eight triple tries a night. (Here’s a fun bit of trivia. Only five players made 75 3-pointers, dished 100 assists, and snagged 35 steals after the trade deadline last season : James Harden, Stephen Curry, Luka Dončić, Tyrese Haliburton … and Quentin Grimes!) While all three have plus wingspans — the 6-foot-2 Maxey measured with a 6-7 wingspan, the 6-4 Edgecombe came in at 6-7.5, and the 6-4 Grimes lists at 6-8 — that’s an awfully small group across the perimeter. If Nurse rolls with either George or Kelly Oubre Jr. at the 4 — which would probably make sense, given the dicey set of prospective options at power forward on this roster (though we should keep an eye on Trendon Watford, who showed some intriguing flashes in limited minutes in Brooklyn) — Philly would boast one of the smaller starting fives in the league. That, in turn, would place an even heavier rim-protection and defensive-rebounding burden on the center spot — not exactly an ideal set of circumstances with Embiid coming off yet another injury-ravaged campaign and subsequent surgery, and with question marks young (second-year pro Adem Bona, second-round pick Johni Broome) and old (14th-year pro Andre Drummond) waiting behind him. Smaller, more athletic lineups might be able to mitigate some of the size discrepancies by cranking up the ball pressure on the perimeter, dialing up more blitzes, traps and aggressive schemes — all trademarks of Nurse’s defenses dating back to his tenure in Toronto — in pursuit of more short-circuited possessions, more turnovers and more opportunities to get out in transition. Philly ranked in the top five in opponent turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, according to Cleaning the Glass; it’s a stylistic approach that seems like a hand-in-glove fit for all those fresh young legs. Would it prove as clean a fit with Embiid and George, though? If not … well, at this point, how much can Nurse, Daryl Morey and Co. really prioritize what works best for the vets? That’s the conundrum in a nutshell. The Sixers have effectively built two rosters: one veteran-laden group tilted toward trying to immediately contend for a title (Embiid, George, Drummond, Oubre, Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon) and one 25-and-under crew pointed toward several years down the line (Maxey, McCain, Edgecombe, Grimes). With nearly 70% of this season’s salary cap committed to Embiid and George, the Sixers are somewhat locked into the former construction — the sort of situation in which you’d burn the boats and go all-in on maximizing your chances of contending today, especially in an Eastern hierarchy dramatically overhauled by injuries elsewhere. With those three guards in the fold for years to come, though — and with Grimes evidently at least somewhat open to the idea of re-upping on a multi-year deal come season’s end — they also have to be more mindful of keeping what’s left of their powder dry building for the long haul than a team that has pledged itself to the Embiid-George pairing typically would be. [ Get more 76ers news: Philadelphia team feed ] (And if things once again go south, it’ll be trickier to just pull the plug and go into the tank this season. After retaining last season’s top-six-protected pick by landing third in the lottery, Philly’s 2026 first-rounder — owed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in exchange for taking Al Horford off the Sixers’ hands all those years ago — is now just top- four -protected.) It all leads to colliding senses of urgency and uncertainty — the feeling that nobody knows what the hell’s about to happen, and that it has to happen right freaking now , and that last year’s wasted, flailing season in the wilderness cannot happen again. “We need to set a standard,” Maxey said on media day . “This is who we are, no matter who plays, who doesn’t play.” Establish that standard, and actually get everybody to play — particularly that big dude — and maybe this can finally be the year. Embiid returns to (most of) his MVP form, George returns to (most of) his All-NBA self, and Maxey makes the next leap in line, giving the Sixers the kind of bona fide Big Three they’d been banking on. With Edgecombe and McCain providing thunder, lightning and impeccable vibes in the backcourt, and Grimes connecting the dots on the wing, Philly soars back into the top 10 in offensive efficiency, and Nurse schemes up enough advantages for the team to get back to league-average on the other end (and elite when Joel’s manning the middle). The Sixers make everyone who loved their 2024 offseason look like geniuses, rocketing to a top-four seed in the East and entering April mostly healthy, setting Embiid up to make the kind of run we’ve all been waiting for. Embiid barely plays, and barely looks like himself in the process. George looks less like the fire of old and more like the fire’s gone out, that contract growing heavier and more burdensome by the minute. The young side dishes can’t add up to a main course. Nurse’s mad-scientist act fails to produce results, growing stale quickly. The Sixers suck again, but not enough, and hand something like the sixth pick in the draft to Oklahoma City. Night falls on an era in Philadelphia basketball; whatever and whoever is around to start the 2026-27 season will look very, very different. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Boston Complete schedule I am nothing if not resolute in my desire to tilt at windmills. Give me 60 games of Embiid and George; give me the over. (Just not, like, as an actual bet with actual money.) East : Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards West : Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz"}

A new report lights a fire under rumors that Antetokounmpo is eyeing another team — right now the Knicks — but then he comes out and throws cold water on it, calming things down. For now. Here is what Antetokounmpo said on Wednesday, via Eric Nehm of The Athletic . “I’ve said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I’m here. I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I’m here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it’s definitely going to be hard. We’re going to take it day-by-day, but I’m here. So, all the other extra stuff does not matter. I think I’ve communicated with my teammates, communicated with the people I respect and love that the moment I step on this court or in this facility I wear this jersey, the rest does not matter. I’m locked into whatever I have in front of me. “Now, if in six, seven months, I change my mind, I think that’s human too, you’re allowed to make any decision you want, but I’m locked in. I’m locked in to this team. I’m locked in to these guys, to this group and to this coaching staff and to myself.” Unsurprisingly, coach Doc Rivers was trying to play things down as well . “If you read [Antetokounmpo’s] comments this summer, every comment he’s made is about being in Milwaukee, loving the city, but for some reason. And it’s funny, what’s the old saying, you create the story and then you report on the story you created. And that’s what it feels like. And it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing we can do about it, but I can tell you Jon has never called a team about Giannis. That has never happened. And until that happens, you really don’t have a story.” Notice Antetokounmpo said, “if in six, seven months I change my mind,” — that would be next offseason. It’s not a coincidence he threw that timeline out there. It means don’t expect him to be pushing for a trade at the February deadline. Antetokounmpo realizes that trading his $54.1 million salary in-season to a place he wants to be is incredibly difficult and unlikely to happen. The real inflection point in this relationship between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo comes next offseason, when Antetokounmpo is extension eligible and the Bucks can offer a max deal of four years, around $260 million (or more, depending upon the salary cap). In the past, every time he has been extension eligible, Antetokounmpo has used that as leverage to get the Bucks to do more to build a contending team, but he ultimately signed the deal and stayed in Wisconsin. He may well do that again, or he might refuse to sign it and then the trade talks are on. Until then, Antetokounmpo says he is all in with the Bucks for this season. A Division of NBCUniversal .

It puts an end to a six-year NBA absence in the country following a breakdown in relationships over protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2019. The matches will take place at The Venetian Arena in Macau, a special administrative region of China close to Hong Kong. The NBA have announced a multi-year partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba at the end of last year, which they believe will enhance fan engagement using AI technology. The Nets are also owned by the company's chair Joseph Tsai, a Taiwanese-Canadian businessman. It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau since 2007 The NBA has not held games in China for six years after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a message on Twitter, now X, in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Morey tweeted: \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the the Chinese Basketball Association and streaming platforms suspended all cooperation with the team and immediately stopped broadcasting their games. Send us your questions Originally a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong, signed a treaty in 1984 with China that would see them return to Chinese administation in 1997, under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". In June 2019, protests started in the country against plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Rights groups accused China of perceived interference, resulting in clashes with the police which lasted until 2024. The NBA estimates that around 300 million people play basketball in China - but much of its popularity stems from the success of Yao Ming in the NBA. The 7ft 5in centre joined the Houston Rockets in 2002, helping to transform them into \"China's team\" during a seven-year spell in the United States. The Macau games aim to bolster the NBA's profile in China further, capitalising on an audience that is eager for the return of the sport. Games have now returned to Chinese state television, with the nation estimated to bring in $5bn (Â£3.7bn) for NBA China, according to ESPN. \"We are experiencing as great enthusiasm for the game as we ever have in China,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \"As you know, there's tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China, so it's wonderful to be back here.\" Suns guard and four-time NBA All-Star Devin Booker adds: \"Basketball without borders is super important, being here on their homeland and letting them see us play in person.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

The 2025-26 NBA season is here! We're rolling out our previews — examining the biggest questions, best- and worst-case scenarios, and win projections for all 30 franchises — from the still-rebuilding teams to the true title contenders. Record: 34-48 (13th in the West, missed playoffs) Offensive rating : 113.5 (19th) Defensive rating : 116.3 (25th) Additions: Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, Dylan Harper, Carter Bryant, David Jones-Garcia Subtractions: Chris Paul, Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Kam Jones, Charles Bassey, David Duke Jr. Complete roster That’s not exactly a mind-blowing shocker of a setup, I’ll grant. San Antonio’s season will come down to whether or not its best player plays well enough to get the franchise back to the playoffs? Holy crap, dude — thanks for the scoop! What my framing lacks in surprise, though, it makes up for in, y’know, correctness . All the maneuvering that’s taken place in the eight months since we last saw Wembanyama in live regular-season action — the signings, the draft picks, the hirings — only matters insofar as it allows the Spurs to maximize him and, in turn, allows him to maximize them . This whole revolution’s only going as far as Wembanyama can push it. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] After a globetrotting side quest summer informed by the “traumatic experience” of being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and his subsequent realization that “life isn’t forever,” it sure seems like the 7-foot-5 All-Star is eager to push it an awfully long way. What Wembanyama has described as a “brutal,” “violent” and “world-class” offseason of training that included instruction from legendary big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin Garnett left him not only feeling ready for a return , but itching for one. “I feel like I need to play basketball now,” he said at Spurs media day . As it turns out, watching him do that is still rad as hell … … and inspires thoughts of the Spurs — fresh off maxing out trade-deadline acquisition De’Aaron Fox , striking it rich in the 2025 NBA draft lottery with No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper , and opportunistically adding veteran helpers in free agency — advancing to the postseason for the first time in six years. The path back to the playoffs starts on the defensive end, where the return of Wembanyama — who’s led the NBA in blocks per game in each of his first two seasons, who finished fourth in defensive estimated plus-minus last year, and who was the odds-on favorite for Defensive Player of the Year before the season-ending blood-clot diagnosis — obviously looms exceptionally large. The Spurs allowed 112.4 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions with Wembanyama on the floor last season — a top-eight mark in the league over the course of the full season. Without him, though, they gave up the store, conceding 121.6 points-per-100 in his absence — an abdication of resistance miles below what even the ghastly, league-worst Pelicans defense mustered. That 9.2 points-per-100 delta represented the second-largest on-court/off-court differential among defenders who logged at least 1,000 minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass , behind only Pascal Siakam in Indianapolis. Shoring up the defensive infrastructure around and, crucially, behind Wembanyama is Job No. 1 in San Antonio. \"This is non-negotiable,\" Wembanyama told reporters on media day . \"It's not something you can't do if you want to be part of our team. We are going to hold each other accountable. We know the coach is going to hold us accountable. It doesn't matter your status — defense is non-negotiable.\" There’s reason for optimism that the surrounding talent can live up to the big fella’s expectations. Though not considered an elite point-of-attack defender, Fox boasts quick feet and quicker hands, leading the league in steals two seasons ago. Oft-injured sixth-year swingman Devin Vassell (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle (6-6, 6-9 wingspan) both have the tools to take a step forward on that end. When he’s cleared after rehabilitating from thumb surgery , Harper (6-5, 6-10 wingspan) also brings great positional size and prospective defensive versatility in the backcourt — and enough bravado to predict a playoff berth at his introductory post-draft press conference. [ Get more Spurs news: San Antonio team feed ] Free-agent signing Luke Kornet blossomed into one of the NBA’s most underrated players during his tenure in Boston, due in large part to his rim protection. Opponents shot just 52.2% at the basket last season when Kornet was the closest defender — a top-10 mark among players to contest at least 200 up-close tries, according to Second Spectrum tracking . A few spots above him on that list? Wembanyama, at 50% even. Expect now-firmly-entrenched head coach Mitch Johnson to experiment some with two-big lineups featuring both Wemby and Kornet, which have the potential to turn everything below the free-throw line into a no-fly zone … and also make a little high-low magic on the other end: Extension-eligible forward Jeremy Sochan was miscast as a point guard and has yet to find firm offensive footing through three pro seasons, but he’s developing into one of the league’s most dogged, physical and versatile point-of-attack defenders — one of a number of intriguing pieces for newly imported associate head coach Sean Sweeney, who helped construct top-10-caliber defenses in Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas, to move around the chessboard. (It’ll be interesting to see if first-round pick Carter Bryant, who profiles as a potential central-casting 3-and-D addition , pushes his way into the decision-making calculus, too.) Leaning on the defense might be the best course of action for a Spurs team that scored at a below-league-average rate of efficiency even with Wembanyama on the floor last season, that enters the new campaign with a roster with relatively few proven plus shooters — Vassell, veteran power forward Harrison Barnes, reserve wing Julian Champagnie, new additions Kelly Olynyk and Lindy Waters III — and that will be relying heavily on a gaggle of guards with iffy-at-best long-range strokes. How quickly and effectively Wembanyama and Fox can develop chemistry after playing just 120 minutes together across five games last season could go a long way toward determining the ceiling of San Antonio’s offense … which makes Fox’s media-day revelation that he expects to miss opening night recovering from an offseason hamstring injury at least a little bit concerning, especially with Harper likewise coming off surgery to his shooting hand. (If Johnson responds by moving Castle to the point, and the UConn product shines in a larger on-ball role, an exciting but already somewhat murky pecking order in the Spurs’ backcourt becomes even more interesting.) The cure for what’s ailed the offense, of course, could just wind up being an even stronger application of That Gigantic French Guy. NBA.com’s John Schuhmann noted that a mere 37% of Wembanyama’s field-goal attempts last season came inside the paint — a function of Big Vic’s determination to explore the outer limits of his unicornic abilities, but also perhaps a misappropriation of 7-foot-5-inch resources. Redistribute some of those looks to the interior, where he can show off some of the hard-won gains of that “brutal,” “violent,” “world-class” offseason … … and the Spurs’ overall shot quality and offensive efficiency will probably start to tick up no matter who else is on the court. Pair that with continual advancement as a playmaker off the dribble — Wemby’s already talking about turning down “a shot I could make with my eyes closed [...] to get one of my teammates a shot he could make in his sleep” — and the Spurs might have the recipe for their first above-average finish in points scored per possession in a half-dozen years . Pair that with the sort of defensive ascent that Wembanyama’s demanding, and we could be talking about a team poised not only to return to the playoffs, but to be an absolute bear to deal with once they get there. Wembanyama stays healthy for the full season, muscling his way onto the MVP ballot and All-NBA First Team. Fox finds his flow alongside the big fella, returning to the All-Star team and providing San Antonio with the battery of a top-10 offense. Castle cements himself as the kind of 16-game two-way player with which the Spurs will need to surround Wemby; Harper wows enough in a limited role to keep everybody convinced he’s the right long-term running buddy, and that whatever issues the Spurs have to navigate in the backcourt are high-class, champagne problems. San Antonio builds on last season’s 12-win jump, surging to 50 wins and home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs, making it abundantly clear to all parties that the future is here, and it’s French. The expected reinforcements don’t keep the wheels from falling off when Wembanyama hits the bench, drastically lowering San Antonio’s ceiling. Fox’s jumper and fit alongside Vic look shaky, leading to no small amount of grumbling over whether that 30% max might’ve been a tad hasty. None of the young perimeter pieces look quite ready for prime time, leaving fans wondering just how many bona fide blue-chippers they’ve actually got on hand. A season that begins with postseason expectations ends with another sub-.500 finish shy of the play-in tournament, and with the hotly anticipated coronation of the next big thing stalled once again. Season opener : Oct. 22 at Dallas Complete schedule An 11-win leap feels like it’d require neither Wembanyama nor Fox missing significant time and Fox returning to All-Star level after an up-and-down 2024-25. That’s certainly the bet that the Spurs have made; in what looks like, to borrow Vic’s phrasing, a brutal, violent and world-class Western Conference, though, I’m not so sure that’s where I’m willing to put my chips down just yet.

The NBA preseason is well underway, and we're a little over a week away from the regular season tipping off. That means we've got plenty of fantasy basketball draft content up on the site. Whether it's dynasty sleepers or players to avoid at ADP or just straight rankings , we've got it all up there. Today, I'm going to add to that collection by looking at players who can help you in drafts if you're looking for three-point value. In a standard 9-category fantasy basketball league, you pile up stats in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), 3-Pointers Made, and Turnovers. That means, when we're looking for three-point help, we are looking for accumulators, players who will make a lot of threes, but also players who shoot at a high enough percent that they won't tank our field goal percentage. In this article, I looked at some of my favorite targets, specifically for three-point value, spread throughout the draft. I separated the article into two sections: early round picks (guys in the top 100 in ADP, which is approximately the first eight rounds) and then everybody outside of that. So flag some of these guys in your draft prep, and good luck assembling your teams. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage.

It's fun to clown on Jordan Poole on social media because he's made some boneheaded plays, and he also got punched in the face by his own teammate once, but he can shoot. Poole had a bit of a mini-breakout with Washington last season, and put up 9.1 three-pointers per game, ninth-most in the league, while making 37.8% of them. His 3.5 made threes per game was 9th-best in basketball. Poole now heads to the Pelicans, where only Zion Williamson is a really high-usage player in the starting lineup. Trey Murphy III is a talented player, but Poole didn't have a 30% usage rate in Washington just to cede tons of opportunities to Murphy. Zion also only played 30 games last year and has a checked injury past, so when he is inevitably out for a bit, who do you think it's going to be putting up shots? Miller put up the third-most three-point field goals per game at 10.9 attempts and also made a solid 35.5% of them. That's not shooting the lights out, but that's a pretty good clip given the amount of shooting he's doing. The 22-year-old played only 27 games last season, but he had a 28% usage rate, and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. I think you're getting a bit of a discount based on his injury, but I will take a 36.6% career three-point shooter who has put up nearly eight threes per game in his young career. Yes, it's possible that we've pushed Pritchard's draft cost up too high in this new-look Celtics offense that tried hard to rid themselves of big salaries after the Jayson Tatum injury, so they could get under the second apron. We know Pritchard is going to start and see big minutes, but a top-80 pick is certainly a decent investment. Still, if you need three-point value, it's hard to pass up on a guy who shot 40.7% from behind the arc and whose 3.2 made threes per game was 14th-best in basketball. The Celtics as a team love to shoot threes. Now, that philosophy might change a bit with the new personnel, but I can't see them simply becoming a grind-it-out team like the Marc Gasol Grizzlies, so there will be three-point shots taken, and both Pritchard and Simons are likely to take them. I'm shocked the Celtics were able to get Simons this offseason, but it's a nice add for the team, and his 3.1 made threes per game last year with Portland was 17th-best in basketball. Simons is not as efficient a shooter as Pritchard is, but I like his all-around game better, so I'd rather take him since both are going in the same range. Thomas is another guy who didn't play a full season last year, playing only 25 games due to hamstring injuries. When he was on the court, he was a 32% usage player who took 7.8 three-point attempts per game, which was 24th-most in basketball. His 2.7 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 33rd in the NBA, and while he shot them at just 34.9%, which is slightly below a few players on this list, it's not really a mark that's going to hurt your overall field goal percentage. Since you want to focus more on the made three-pointers when targeting three-point value in the draft, I like Thomas because who else is going to shoot on Brooklyn? Thomas is also playing on a qualifying offer, which means he's going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season, and you know he's going to try and earn a big payday. His 3.0 made threes per game was 19th-best in basketball. While that was with the Clippers, he finds himself in a pretty good situation in Miami with Tyler Herro out. Andrew Wiggins posted just a 25.5% usage rate last year and is not a three-point shooter. Davion Mitchell is not a huge usage player and averaged just 2.9 three-point attempts per game in his career. The Heat are going to need Powell to space the floor and create space in the post for Bam Adebayo and slashing lanes for Wiggins. I think the three-point value will be here again. A little over a week ago, I had Buzelis as a sleeper based on his ADP of 110 at the time. That ADP has since been slowly creeping up, and then he went out on Tuesday night and scored 19 points in 18 minutes in the first preseason game. Buzelis shot 36.1% from deep last season, but he played only 19 minutes per game and took only 6.9 total shots per game. However, he joined the Bulls starting lineup in February and took 4.9 three-pointers per game in 22 games between March and April. He also shot 39% from deep over those 22 games. I think this kid is going to be special, and I could see him being a high usage player on this Bulls team. Look, Cam Johnson is not going to head to Denver and be a high-usage player, but the good news is that he wasn't one in Brooklyn either. Johnson had just a 22.5% usage rate in Brooklyn last season, but still took 7.2 three-point attempts per game with the Nets, which was 33rd-most in basketball. His 2.8 made three-pointers per game ranked 31st in the NBA, and he shot them at 39%. Jamal Murray, Christian Braun , and Aaron Gordon are not three-point shooters. This is what Johnson was brought to Denver to do, and now he gets to do it on a significantly better team. Fantasy Basketball 2025-26 Preseason Top 200: Nikola Jokić, SGA lead the way; updated LeBron James ranking Nikola Jokić headlines Rotoworld’s Preseason Top 200, but key injuries across the league make this one of the most unpredictable fantasy seasons in years. Raphielle Johnson , Noah Rubin , +1 More Hunter was pretty good in Cleveland after coming over in the middle of the season from Atlanta, but a lot of his totals dipped a bit in a bench role. Still, on the season, his 2.5 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 44th in the NBA, and he shot them at a 40.5% clip. With Max Strus hurt and Isaac Okoro no longer in Cleveland, there's a decent chance that Hunter will begin the season as the starting small forward for the Cavs. If that's the case, he should put up something closer to his 6.7 three-point attempts per game with the Hawks, and, considering he's a career 37.3% shooter from deep, that you could be looking at around 2.5 made three-pointers per game while also posting stats across the board on one of the best teams he's ever been on. Last year in Portland, Grant had just a 19.5% usage rate, but he still put up 6.3 three-point attempts per game, which was 49th-best in basketball. He shot them at a 36.5% mark, so he didn't hurt your field goal percentage, and hit 2.3 per game, which made him a value in that category. With Anfernee Simons now in Boston, opportunities are there for the taking. Jrue Holiday was brought in, but he's more of a facilitator than a guard who looks for his own shot. I like Deni Avdija , and Shaedon Sharpe could take a big step forward this year, but he's a career 33% shooter from three, so I don't think he's going to threaten Grant's ability to space the floor. Plus, at this ADP, the risk is so minimal. I don't know what O'Neale's role is going to be on this team with Durant gone, but Jalen Green in town. Still, his 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked tied for 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at a career-high 40.6%. There is a chance that Green and Devin Booker will simply shoot so much that O'Neale doesn't get enough opportunities, and that also goes for Grayson Allen - PG/SG/SF, PHO (ADP: 219) , but both of these guys are willing to launch from deep and can hit at a high clip, so if we start to see one getting more opportunities this pre-season, it's time to pounce. I mentioned Trent Jr. on Twitter/X as one of my sleepers for this season because I think he has a good chance to start on this Milwaukee team. There are a lot of high usage players in this lineup, but there are also a lot of players who command defensive attention, so Trent is going to be used to space the floor, and he's likely going to get plenty of open looks. His 2.4 made three-pointers per game last year ranked 46th in the NBA, and he shot them at 41.6%, which was the second-best mark of his career. If you need three-point value with one of your last picks, he's perhaps my favorite."}

Of all the milestones LeBron James has reached, this season might feature his most impressive ones. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar already holds the NBA's career records for points scored and minutes played, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's standards in each of the past two seasons, respectively. James now trails Robert Parish's record for games played by 49 appearances. (He played 70 games last season.) That's right: By February, James could have played more in the NBA than anyone ever. Imagine that. Even with all that hype coming into the league as \"The Chosen One\" in 2003, if you had said he would retire as the NBA's all-time leader in games, minutes and points, you would have thought he met all expectations. [ Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7 ] I will leave it to you to consider whether we set our standards too high for our heroes. Regardless, what's even more remarkable about the things James can accomplish this season: There is a real chance he could end this campaign with more rebounds than Dennis Rodman, more assists than Jason Kidd, more steals than Gary Payton, more 3-pointers than Reggie Miller and more triple-doubles than Magic Johnson. And again: He already has more points than anyone ever. This is mind-blowing stuff. 22. Charles Oakley (12,205) 23. Dennis Rodman (11,954) 24. Kevin Willis (11, 901) 25. LeBron James (11,731) 26. Patrick Ewing (11,607) (James grabbed 546 rebounds last season. He trails Rodman by 223.) 1. John Stockton (15,806) 2. Chris Paul (12,499) 3. Jason Kidd (12,091) 4. LeBron James (11,584) 5. Steve Nash (10,335) (James doled out 575 assists last season. He trails Kidd by 507.) 3. Jason Kidd (2,684) 4. Michael Jordan (2,514) 5. Gary Payton (2,445) 6. LeBron James (2,345) 7. Maurice Cheeks (2,310) (James swiped 70 steals last season. He trails Payton by 100.) 4. Damian Lillard (2,804) 5. Klay Thompson (2,697) 6. Reggie Miller (2,560) 7. LeBron James (2,559) 8. Kyle Korver (2,450) (James made 149 3-pointers last season. He trails Miller by one.) 2. Oscar Robertson (181) 3. Nikola Jokić (164) 4. Magic Johnson (138) 5. LeBron James (122) 6. Jason Kidd (107) (James logged 10 triple-doubles last season. He trails Johnson by 16.) Kevin Durant is, without a doubt, one of the greatest scoring weapons in NBA history. He has averaged 27.2 points per game on 50/39/88 shooting splits for a 17-year career, and he is still approaching those numbers — if not surpassing them — on an annual basis, despite a debilitating Achilles injury at age 30. Believe it or not, that has him apace to surpass Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list. Yes, that Michael Jordan, the one considered the greatest scorer ever, even if others have scored more points. 5. Michael Jordan (32,292) 6. Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) 7. Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) (Durant scored 1,647 points last season. He trails Jordan by 1,721.) For the record: Jordan scored his 32,292 points in 1,072 games. Durant has already played 1,123 games. Meanwhile, James Harden could also move into the top 10 on both the all-time scoring and assist lists. 8. Kevin Durant (30,571) 9. Shaquille O'Neal (28,596) 10. Carmelo Anthony (28,289) 11. James Harden (27,687) 12. Moses Malone (27, 409) (Harden scored 1,802 points last season. He trails O'Neal by 909.) 10. Isiah Thomas (9,061) 11. Gary Payton (8,966) 12. Andre Miller (8,524) 13. James Harden (8,316) 14. Rod Strickland (7,987) (Harden doled out 687 assists last season. He trails Thomas by 745.) Of course, Harden (4,260 turnovers) also trails Karl Malone (4,524) for third on a more troublesome list . If only he can find a team, Russell Westbrook could join James, Durant and Harden in the top 15 on the all-time scoring list. He is ranked 20th, but another year like last season could propel him as high as 14th. 14. Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) 15. Oscar Robertson (26,710) 16. Dominique Wilkins (26,668) 17. Tim Duncan (26,496) 18. Paul Pierce (26,397) 19. John Havlicek (26,395) 20. Russell Westbrook (26,205) 21. Kevin Garnett (26,071) (Westbrook scored 994 points last season. He trails Olajuwon by 741.) Westbrook is also 75 assists from 10,000 and 45 steals from 2,000 for his career. Other members of the 10,000-assist, 2,000-steal club: LeBron James, Chris Paul, John Stockton and Jason Kidd. James is the only other one among them who has also scored 25,000 points in his career. Westbrook could join James in another exclusive club, as he is 171 turnovers away from becoming the second player ever to commit 5,000 in a career. Westbrook committed 242 turnovers for the Nuggets.

Fantasy basketball season is here, and the best way to prep for your drafts is to mock, mock again and mock some more! Drafting out of the No. 12 spot in a 12-team, 9-cat league offers the benefit of back-to-back picks to start your build, but it comes with its own set of challenges. The top-tier players have been selected, and your two picks will be the only ones you have until your next two picks nearly two full rounds later. I completed a mock drafting from this spot to show how it might play out. Here are the results and brief analysis. 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Draft Prep Guide: Rankings, strategy, sleepers, mock draft results, and more Your one-stop-shop for Rotoworld’s fantasy basketball draft coverage. Rotoworld Staff , 1. Nikola Jokić (DEN - C) 2. Victor Wembanyama (SAS - C) 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL - PF,C) 4. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC - PG) 5. Luka Dončić (LAL - PG,SG) 6.

Jalen Johnson (ATL - SF,PF) Drafting from the 12 spot with back-to-back picks, my options are wide open, but there is some strategy involved here. With the clear-cut top options off the board, I turned my attention to the slew of quality second-rounders. Having the 12th pick means I get two players and don’t get to draft again for 23 more picks. Taking Thompson and J-Dub here may look like a slight reach, but I value them more highly than any of the other players taken in the same range, and neither would have gotten back to me at Pick 36. My first two picks lean into a build that’s punting three-pointers, but I try to make up some ground in that category later in the draft. I’m already off to a solid start with rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and FG%. I’m not too shabby in the scoring department with this duo, but points won’t be at a premium after my selections in Rounds 3-4. 25. LeBron James (LAL - SF,PF) 26. LaMelo Ball (CHA - PG,SG) 27. Scottie Barnes (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 28. Jaylen Brown (BOS - SG,SF) 29. Josh Giddey (CHI - PG,SG) 30. Pascal Siakam (IND - PF,C) 31. Jamal Murray (DEN - PG,SG) 32. Bam Adebayo (MIA - PF,C) 33. Derrick White (BOS - PG,SG) 34. Franz Wagner (ORL - SF,PF) 35. Ivica Zubac (LAC - C) 36. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 37. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 38. De'Aaron Fox (SAS - PG,SG) 39. Desmond Bane (ORL - SG,SF) 40. Trey Murphy III (NOP - SF,PF) 41. Jaren Jackson Jr. (MEM - PF,C) 42. Kawhi Leonard (LAC - SF,PF) 43. Dyson Daniels (ATL - PG,SG,SF) 44. Deni Avdija (POR - SF,PF) 45. Jimmy Butler III (GSW - SF,PF) 46. Ja Morant (MEM - PG) 47. Zion Williamson (NOP - SF,PF) 48. Myles Turner (MIL - C) Banchero is expected to take another step forward in Year 4 after a tremendous 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocked shots and 1.9 three-pointers. His shooting percentages weren’t elite (45.2 FG%, 72.7 FT%), but Banchero offered a ton of value as a scorer, rebounder and facilitator. His dual eligibility as a PF and C makes him an excellent and versatile selection, but he will need to improve his percentages and defensive contributions to pay off his Round 3-4 ADP. The first rookie comes off the board at 37, and he goes to me. Flagg is expected to take on a sizeable role in Year 1, and he could be utilized even more on offense while Kyrie Irving is out. Flagg represents an elite, two-way talent who can rack up points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Taking him at 37 is a bit of a reach, and I’m probably grabbing him at his ceiling. Nevertheless, I want to get him on my team for the tremendous upside, and he won’t be available when it’s my turn to pick at the 5-6 turn. 49. Kristaps Porziņģis (ATL - PF,C) 50. Joel Embiid (PHI - C) 51. Brandon Miller (CHA - SF,PF) 52. Austin Reaves (LAL - PG,SG) 53. Lauri Markkanen (UTA - SF,PF) 54. Miles Bridges (CHA - SF,PF) 55. Nikola Vučević (CHI - C) 56. DeMar DeRozan (SAC - SF) 57. Josh Hart (NYK - SG,SF,PF) 58. Jalen Duren (DET - C) 59. Walker Kessler (UTA - C) 60. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 61. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 62. Jarrett Allen (CLE - C) 63. Zach LaVine (SAC - PG,SG) 64. Darius Garland (CLE - PG) 65. Coby White (CHI - PG,SG) 66. Paul George (PHI - SG,SF,PF) 67. Payton Pritchard (BOS - PG) 68. OG Anunoby (NYK - SF,PF) 69. Brandon Ingram (TOR - SG,SF,PF) 70. Isaiah Hartenstein (OKC - C) 71. Rudy Gobert (MIN - C) 72. Immanuel Quickley (TOR - PG,SG) The purpose of mock drafts is to learn. Trial-and-error is the name of the game, and admittedly, this is a bit of an error. While there is nothing inherently wrong with selecting Ayton at 60, I didn’t need to grab him. Paolo Banchero is eligible at Center, meaning I could have pivoted to a player with PG eligibility - a position with which this team is scarce on depth. I addressed Center depth later in the draft with Jakob Poeltl, who is a fine pick a couple rounds later. Live and learn. I’m happy to grab Thompson at 61, but he is far riskier than his “breakout” moniker implies. Like his brother, Detroit’s Thompson is an athletic phenom, capable of scoring in transition and elevating at the rim on offense and adept at disrupting opponents on the defensive end. He doesn’t have an outside shot, and playing time is still questionable given how many minutes he’s played in his first two seasons. A bump in court time and additional usage as a playmaker would do wonders for his fantasy value. 73. Andrew Nembhard (IND - PG,SG) 74. Jordan Poole (NOP - PG,SG) 75. Tyler Herro (MIA - PG,SG) 76. Julius Randle (MIN - PF,C) 77. Michael Porter Jr. (BKN - SF,PF) 78. Norman Powell (MIA - SG,SF) 79. Anfernee Simons (BOS - PG,SG) 80. Bradley Beal (LAC - SG,SF) 81. Jrue Holiday (POR - PG,SG) 82. Jalen Suggs (ORL - PG) 83. Jalen Green (PHX - PG,SG) 84. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 85. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 86. Christian Braun (DEN - SG,SF) 87. Donovan Clingan (POR - C) 88. Matas Buzelis (CHI - SF,PF) 89. Mark Williams (PHX - C) 90. Bennedict Mathurin (IND - SG,SF) 91. Cameron Johnson (DEN - SF,PF) 92. John Collins (LAC - PF,C) 93. RJ Barrett (TOR - SF,PF) 94. Kel'el Ware (MIA - PF,C) 95. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL - C) 96. Shaedon Sharpe (POR - SG,SF) Thomas is my favorite player in fantasy basketball this season. He’s a certified bucket coming off the best statistical season of his career. Thomas’ would-be breakout campaign was hampered by injuries, and he’ll surely be hungry to get back on the court in 2025-26. Thomas should also have some additional motivation after going through lengthy contract negotiations with Brooklyn that ultimately led to him accepting a qualifying offer. He’ll be playing for pride and for a new contract. Watch out. As mentioned earlier, I didn’t need to reach for Ayton at the end of the fifth round. I had Banchero, and Poeltl was available three rounds later as a strong, later-round center option. He’s coming off the best season of his career and just inked a big extension with the Raptors. Toronto’s center depth is bare, so fantasy managers should expect big minutes and solid production with a discount price tag on draft day. 97. Mikal Bridges (NYK - SF,PF) 98. Devin Vassell (SAS - SG,SF) 99. Santi Aldama (MEM - PF,C) 100. D'Angelo Russell (DAL - PG) 101. Tobias Harris (DET - PF) 102. Herbert Jones (NOP - SF,PF) 103. Andrew Wiggins (MIA - SG,SF) 104. Nic Claxton (BKN - C) 105. Alex Sarr (WAS - C) 106. Naz Reid (MIN - PF,C) 107. Draymond Green (GSW - PF,C) 108. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 109. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 110. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (ATL - SG,SF) 111. Keegan Murray (SAC - SF,PF) 112. Dereck Lively II (DAL - C) 113. CJ McCollum (WAS - PG,SG) 114. Zach Edey (MEM - C) 115. Aaron Gordon (DEN - PF,C) 116. Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL - C) 117. Jeremy Sochan (SAS - PF,C) 118. Jaden Ivey (DET - PG,SG) 119. Jaden McDaniels (MIN - SF,PF) 120. Bobby Portis (MIL - PF,C) KPJ is penciled in as Milwaukee’s starting PG, and we’ve seen his tremendous upside in flashes throughout his career. Porter Jr. had some good moments in Cleveland before moving to Houston and breaking out at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. Injuries and off-court issues have prevented him from being on the court more during his NBA tenure, but if he can stay healthy and out of trouble in 2025-26, he should be able to post respectable numbers. KPJ averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.7 steals across five starts between the Clippers and Bucks last season. George is one of the players I highlighted in Rotoworld’s Staff Favorites article. The young and athletic George is a versatile wing with the ability to get hot from downtown and make a major impact on defense. He played solid minutes for Washington a season ago, but his playing time could increase in Year 2 as the team continues its rebuild. Bilal Coulibaly is dealing with a thumb injury and will miss time early in the season. That opens the door for George to be a starter on opening night. If he can build momentum from the jump, he could parlay early-season success into a quality campaign. 121. Donte DiVincenzo (MIN - PG,SG) 122. Dennis Schröder (SAC - PG,SG) 123. Keyonte George (UTA - PG,SG) 124. Jaylen Wells (MEM - SG,SF) 125. Lonzo Ball (CLE - PG,SG) 126. Quentin Grimes (PHI - SG,SF) 127. Brandin Podziemski (GSW - PG,SG) 128. Reed Sheppard (HOU - PG,SG) 129. Toumani Camara (POR - SF,PF) 130. Klay Thompson (DAL - SG,SF) 131. Malik Monk (SAC - SG) 132. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 133. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 134. Cason Wallace (OKC - PG,SG) 135. Stephon Castle (SAS - PG,SG) 136. Chris Paul (LAC - PG) 137. Aaron Nesmith (IND - SF) 138. Jabari Smith Jr. (HOU - PF,C) 139. Davion Mitchell (MIA - PG) 140. Ty Jerome (MEM - SG) 141. Yves Missi (NOP - C) 142. Tari Eason (HOU - SF,PF) 143. Kyle Kuzma (MIL - SF,PF) 144. Brook Lopez (LAC - C) Another rookie comes off the board as I grab Charlotte’s Kon Knueppel. The Summer League MVP is poised to see big minutes for the Hornets in Year 1. Elite, long-range shooting is his calling card, but he’s a hound on defense and a guy able to get teammates involved with his quality, playmaking abilities. No player had a more tumultuous offseason than Kuminga. After a bizarre 2024-25 season in which he was taken in and out of Golden State’s lineups for reasons that still aren’t inherently clear, Kuminga dealt with trade rumors and contract disputes with the team for months. He finally agreed on a two-year deal, but the prevailing thought is that the Warriors will use him as a trade piece after he’s eligible to be traded in early 2026. He’s playing for his next deal, and the Dubs may look to give him ample playing time as an audition. He’s a risky pickup here, but there is plenty of upside. 145. Daniel Gafford (DAL - C) 146. P.J. Washington (DAL - SF,PF) 147. Kyle Filipowski (UTA - PF,C) 148. Isaiah Collier (UTA - PG,SG) 149. Zaccharie Risacher (ATL - SF,PF) 150. T.J. McConnell (IND - PG) 151. Scoot Henderson (POR - PG) 152. Ace Bailey (UTA - SF) 153. VJ Edgecombe (PHI - SG) 154. Dejounte Murray (NOP - PG,SG) 155. Jay Huff (IND - C) 156. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I debated grabbing Kyrie Irving here but opted to go for a player who could be an immediate contributor. Harper’s path to meaningful minutes isn’t clear given the competition for playing time at guard with De’Aaron Fox and Stephon Castle, but the No. 2 pick surely won’t spend the entirety of his rookie season on the bench. There’s upside here, and that’s what the final round of fantasy drafts is all about. If Ace Bailey hadn’t been taken four picks earlier, he would have been my selection. Given how good he’s looked in the preseason, I highly doubt he’ll be available this late again. 1. Amen Thompson (HOU - PG,SG,SF) 2. Jalen Williams (OKC - SF,PF) 3. Paolo Banchero (ORL - PF,C) 4. Cooper Flagg (DAL - SF) 5. Deandre Ayton (LAL - C) 6. Ausar Thompson (DET - SF,PF) 7. Cam Thomas (BKN - SG,SF) 8. Jakob Poeltl (TOR - C) 9. Kevin Porter Jr. (MIL - PG,SG) 10. Kyshawn George (WAS - SG,SF) 11. Kon Knueppel (CHA - SF) 12. Jonathan Kuminga (GSW - SF,PF) 13. Dylan Harper (SAS - SG) I grabbed several quality defenders here, so my team is good to go with steals, blocks, rebounds and FG%. Three-pointers have been punted, though we may have a few surprisingly competitive weeks in that category if Cam Thomas, Kyshawn George and Kon Knueppel go off. Ultimately, this is a risk/reward build. Jalen Williams is a safe selection, but there are question marks everywhere across this roster. Will the Thompson twins break out? Will Paolo Banchero improve his percentages and defensive numbers enough to make his early-round selection worth the cost? Rookies are always an unknown, and despite the buzz around Cooper Flagg, his early success is far from a guarantee. Picks 7-13 are full of big swings, but they could all be home run selections. Safe picks have never been my forte, so this final roster is certainly indicative of my draft style."}

What Luka Doncic did for his Lakers teammates was unique and different but no less impactful. It was a view inside the superstar guard’s way of leading the team. In a team-building event Doncic organized, he took his teammates to a Porsche Driving Experience after practice Tuesday. He covered the entire cost of the event in which his teammates tested Porsche models on a track. That so impressed Lakers center Deandre Ayton , bringing a smile to his face when asked about Doncic’s gesture. “I truly appreciate Luka for that,” Ayton said. “I’ve never done that before, where the star players really look out for the team like that. Something like that is actually crazy. I’ve never heard of it or been in a Porsche before. So it definitely was my first time. I didn’t know that Luka was into cars like that. So, yeah, him and LeBron [James]. It was good seeing them behind the wheel. Seeing LeBron behind a car is dangerous.” At 7 feet, Ayton was asked if he was comfortable driving the car. “Yeah, they had some cars where they could hold a 7-footer,” he said. “I don’t know if it was custom or that’s how they’re made or some other factors. But just seeing LeBron James in a sports car pushing, I was like, ‘Yo, he knows cars.’ Him doing his thing, that was pretty cool to see.” Read more: Lakers get first glimpse of what Marcus Smart brings to the court All summer and during training camp, the Lakers have talked about building team chemistry. They talked about how doing things together off the court is an important part of building chemistry and of learning about a teammate. Doncic, along with James, is considered one of their leaders and this was seen as magnanimous. “Yeah, I mean, anytime, some of our max players and guys that have been in the league a while can put something on for the team is great,” Gabe Vincent said. “It’s great when we come together, do something a little bit more extravagant maybe than we would have on our own. Everyone gets to walk away with some cool [stuff]. \"Most importantly, you get to do it together, you know what I mean? Sharing experiences is one of the quickest ways to grow closer. So, we’re very grateful to Luka for putting that one on. Everyone had a great time. It's been great to see him get more comfortable.” Vincent also did his part in a team-building moment. Over the summer, he invited his teammates to the sand dunes in Manhattan Beach. It was his show of leadership after so many workouts and his way to help build that team chemistry. “So, I tried to just get guys together, most of them were young guys, but just get out on the sand, play a little spike ball, and work down the sand a little bit,” Vincent said. “It's something to get out of this [practice facility] building, you know what I mean? In the summer, we spend so much time in the gym, grinding at the same thing over and over that sometimes you kind of need a change of scenery. So it's something for us to do that was different, something for us to do together. We had a good time with it.” After two preseason games and several more practices, Ayton is starting to get more comfortable with his role inside the Lakers’ offense. He took more shots in the second game against the Warriors, making three of eight from the field, than in the first game against the Suns, missing both shots, and he scored more points against the Warriors (seven) than against the Suns (two). He blocked two shots in each game and has a total of 15 rebounds. “How comfortable am I getting? Um, real comfortable, to where I am starting to know their plays and where the screens are and in general, Lakers terms and Lakers basketball,” he said. “So, it’s becoming quite easy just to read the floor and what [Lakers coach] JJ [Redick] likes and what he wants us to be known as, especially going into our rhythm offense and transition offense. So, yeah, the terminology and everything is starting to be easy and I feel in control on each end.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers.

But you'll definitely be surprised to learn who's second on that list: Celtics rookie Hugo Gonzalez. That's right: The 6-foot-6 guard from Spain posted a hand length of 10.25 inches at the 2025 NBA Combine , the second-longest measurement in combine history behind only Fall. Subscribe to NBC Sports Boston's podcast network to hear our Insiders bring you the latest insights on your favorite teams! We should note that hand length data at the combine only dates back to 2010, and that Gonzalez's 10.25 inches are tied with two other players: Dexter Pittman and his current Celtics teammate, Xavier Tillman. But we should also reiterate that Gonzalez is a guard and is still just 19 years old, which means he could grow even more. Celtics Insider Chris Forsberg caught up with Boston's 2025 first-round pick at Celtics Media Day to get the skinny on how Gonzalez's massive mitts give him an extra edge. \"You don't realize it, but I guess some blocks that I got were touching with the very last part of my fingers. That's helped,\" Gonzalez told Forsberg. \"If you're going to go for a steal, you have bigger hands (to snatch the ball).\" Gonzalez's hands aren't just large, either -- they're also extremely flexible, as he demonstrated to Forsberg by contorting his pinkie and thumb in various uncomfortable directions. \"It's super elastic, so I can push (my pinkie back),\" Gonzalez said. \"I have elastic hands.\" A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) Gonzalez put those hands into action right away in Boston's first preseason game Wednesday night, racking up three blocks and a steal in the Celtics' 121-103 win . A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) \"As soon as you can impact the game defensively, making the correct feel, the correct things, I think that’s the most important thing apart from having big plays or something like that,\" Gonzalez told reporters after the game . \"Just being correct defensively, so you can help the team to the win.” The young guard, who spent the last three seasons with Real Madrid and debuted with the Spanish club when he was 16, plays with a relentless motor and boasts impressive defensive upside that was on display Wednesday night. He also showed flashes offensively, finishing with eight points on 3-for-4 shooting with a 3-pointer. Gonzalez is still raw, and his NBA development may take time. But it's clear why the rookie's effort and physical traits appealed to president of basketball operations Brad Stevens."}

Nine players typically get selected in the first round of every draft, and then it becomes a crapshoot. Those nine guys include Nikola Jokic, Victor Wembanyama, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Anthony Davis and Trae Young. That means anything can happen at the end of that opening round and the beginning of the second round, but we'll choose the best of the rest for this piece. Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns are often the next two players taken in the opening round, so we'll omit those big men as well. (ADP: 12.8) I'm starting to see Booker creep into the first round of some drafts, and it's about time that everyone comes around. This perennial All-Star is in for a career-high usage rate, thanks to the Suns going into a rebuild. They've parted ways with Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Booker as the only true playmaker on this team. He'll play point guard next to Jalen Green after averaging a career-high 7.1 assists per game last year. His point total did dip to 25.6 points per game, but we expect Booker to get close to 30 since he's likely looking at 35-40 minutes and over 20 shots a night. This might be a bold call, but it wouldn't be surprising to see Booker have a Houston Harden-type season with a league-leading usage rate very much in play. (ADP: 15.3) Speak of the devil! We had Harden as one of our top recommendations in this same article last season, and he delivered a beautiful bounce-back campaign. The former MVP averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 3.0 threes per game. Most importantly, Harden played 79 games last year and has played at least 65 games in all but two years throughout his 16-year career. All the players in the Top 30 post superstar statistics, but the reliability of a 70-game season can't be overlooked from a fantasy perspective. Drafting a 36-year-old always feels risky in the first round, but the consistency speaks for itself. The only real concern is the depth of this roster, but that could lead to Harden creeping back to double-digit assists like we've seen throughout most of his career. (ADP: 19.0) There simply aren't many players as special as KD. This 15-time All-Star is entering his first season with the Houston Rockets and looks poised for another monster season. In a \"down\" 2024-25 campaign, Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 threes per game. He also shot 53 percent from the field, 43 percent from three-point range and 84 percent from the free-throw line. Having an all-around stat line like that is one thing, but adding elite shooting is truly ridiculous. What's even more absurd is that this stat line has been the norm since 2008, so why would we expect anything different this season? The injury question marks, aging and fresh team dynamics are obviously in play, but KD will always be a top-25 player in fantasy until he retires. (ADP: 17.1) It's funny that we have these three aging superstars in here, but it's telling of how many people overlook these guys in drafts. We actually had Harden, Durant and Curry in the same piece last season! Everyone wants the shiny new toys or the mystery box, but these veterans are as safe as it gets. The aging and injuries are the only real concerns with a superstar like Curry, but he still averaged 24.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 4.4 threes per game last year. Curry shot 45 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 93 percent from the free-throw line as well. That sort of shooting is why Curry has been a top-10 player for nearly two decades, and he should remain the focal point of this Warriors offense. We're also encouraged that Curry has played at least 63 games in four of the last five years, and the addition of Jimmy Butler should help open things up for this offense while making Golden State more competitive. (ADP: 25.5) We've presented some unmistakable options to enter the opening round, but let's get one youngster in here that's a bit outside the norm. I'm not advocating that Thompson should be selected in the first round this season, but he seems like one of the most likely guys to enter that realm next year. This 22-year-old showcased an elite fantasy resume in his sophomore season, averaging 14.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. Having defensive numbers like those is nearly impossible to find, and this kid is only scratching the surface of what he could become. Thompson took over ball-handling duties at times in the second half of last season and could be the primary point guard with Fred VanVleet out for the year. We could see Thompson's scoring approach 20 points per game while handing out 5-6 assists a night. Adding that nearly double-digit rebound total and 2.7 stocks per game could have Thompson looking like a top-10 player this season. Other Players in Consideration: Tyrese Maxey, PHI (ADP: 19.9) Alperen Sengun, HOU (ADP: 19.6) Evan Mobley, CLE (ADP: 20.1) LaMelo Ball (ADP: 29.7)"}

The Warriors guard, who was drafted by the team No. 19 overall in 2023 and has started multiple high-stakes games for Golden State over the past two seasons, already is thinking about the future and is ready to take that next step in his career. While he's had the luxury of learning from some of the best in the game, such as Steph Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green , his next goal is having those same players -- plus the Warriors' top decision-makers -- trust him enough to leave him the keys to the franchise when they're gone. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! “When they leave this thing, they got to leave it with somebody,” Podziemski told The Athletic's Nick Friedell in an exclusive interview. “How can I have their trust? And they can go to [owner] Joe [Lacob] and [general manager] Mike [Dunleavy] and be like, “Hey, we want to leave it with him. He’s going to continue what we’re leaving. \"So, I think about that all time, and I set myself up in that position to have that. And there’s a lot of other things than just skill that you need to be in that position.” There has been much chatter about life after Steph, and what that could look like. Would the franchise turn to Podziemski? Jonathan Kuminga ? Whose team would it be? Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Curry, 37, made it clear he still has plenty of gas in the tank as he aims for ring No. 5, but he's also acknowledged that he's approaching the tail end of his career. Podziemski knows he has some growing up to do, emotionally, to gain that trust. “There’s a next step in evolving emotionally, and as a leader,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Having confidence from your teammates is one thing, especially the vets, but them trusting you in big moments that could define their career. Could add another piece to their career. For them to have trust in you is a different thing, and you got to earn that over time, and I think that’s a goal of mine going into this season.” Over the last two-plus years, Podziemski has noticed how hard everyone plays for Curry and the Warriors vets. He's one of those players. But someday, he hopes younger players do the same for him. “Nobody wants to play so hard for Steph [just] because he can shoot the s--t out of the ball,” Podziemski told Friedell. “Nobody wants to play hard for Draymond [just] because his voice is the loudest. It’s doing the right things consistently, being at the right place, the right time, always taking young guys under their wing, showing them the way. That’s the reason why game days, people play so hard for Steph. If someone knocks him down we’re always right there, got his back. “It’s not because he can shoot the ball that that’s the case. It’s so many other things. So, you want to take that and grab your own version of it and apply it. So, when the younger guys come in, and this is my team, if I get that opportunity, they have a reason to play hard for me too.” Warriors coach Steve Kerr has been impressed with what he's seen from Podziemski thus far, as the young guard is set to enter Year 3. Speaking to the media after Day 1 of training camp practice, Kerr applauded Podziemski for taking a \"big leap\" during the second half of last season. But when asked what those next steps look like for Podziemski to take another leap in his third NBA season with Golden State, Kerr also acknowledged that emotional maturity is one of the main things. “Honestly, you’ll laugh,” Kerr began. “But leaving the refs alone. That’s important. It’s important to his energy, his mindset, it’s important for our team’s mindset. And taking that next step in terms of being more even-keeled. One of the hardest lessons I ever learned as a player is when you have that bad night, you have to move on quickly, and you can’t let it get to you. You can’t carry it over into the next day’s practice.” Podziemski admitted he has made a \"conscious effort\" to keep his emotions in check. Once he masters that, whenever that might be, he hopes that will help give him a better chance of one day being the leader of the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The light that gauges the effectiveness of their perimeter defense, particularly at the point of attack. That element is one of several essentials to Golden State’s success, and it has been considerably less than stellar. Opposing guards, some speedy and others shifty, are penetrating with regularity, resulting in paint points, free throws or kickouts to open shooters behind the arc. With our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! That was visible Wednesday night in the first half – with all minutes going to starters and rotation players – of a 129-123 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. It took a massive fourth-quarter comeback by the far end of the bench to wipe out a 16-point halftime deficit. Moses Moody started in the role of primary POA defender against Portland, with coach Steve Kerr pairing him with Stephen Curry in the backcourt. This vulnerability also was visible last Sunday, when Brandin Podziemski started alongside Curry in a 111-103 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. While it’s unreasonable to expect fantastic defense in the first week of the preseason, the Warriors can’t be delighted with a defense that allowed 39 points in the first quarter and 73 in the half. “They were flying by us,” Kerr said. “And then we were collapsing, probably too much. And then they had a ton of threes. I think they made 10 threes in the first half.” Find the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California. Wrong, coach. The Blazers drained 12 triples in the first half. They also posted a 24-16 edge in paint points. This was Golden State’s first look at a starting lineup that might start the 2025-26 NBA regular season. Curry and Moody in the backcourt, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at forward and Al Horford at center . All five posted negative plus/minus numbers in the first half. “I didn’t think we were ready to play,” Kerr said. “I don’t know that we got a good enough look at that lineup to really know. It should fit, with Al’s shooting and we have a lot of length. Moses on the ball. They took it to us right away.” Starting Moody against the Blazers was logical because he’s a rangy defender (6-foot-5, 7-foot wingspan) and a good 3-point shooter. The possibility of him as lead bird dog emerged late last season, after the Warriors traded Andrew Wiggins as part of the deal to acquire Jimmy Butler III, as Kerr explained before tipoff. “He got to guard the ball,” Kerr recalled of Moody. “He got to be in the starting lineup, and he became our point of attack defender, like Wiggs was before. And so, with Wiggs leaving, that opened a void on this team, because Jimmy's not that.” Moody has the potential to be all of that, but it’s clear he’s still trying to master the art of staying in front of quick guards. It’s a tough assignment. He has made 74 starts over four NBA seasons, but starring in that role took Klay Thompson about 300 starts. “They came out and hit us early,” Moody told NBC Sports Bay Area. “It felt like a different game than [against the Lakers]. \"We didn’t do much game planning and preparation. But I think their speed, especially in transition, got us.” Portland guard Shaedon Sharpe finished with a game-high 22 points in 23 minutes, on 9-of-15 shooting, including 4-of-8 from deep. He was plus-14 for the night. Backup guard Blake Wesley, blasting into the paint with relative ease, finished with nine points and six rebounds. Three nights earlier, four Lakers scored in double figures on Sunday – and all were guards: Gabe Vincent (team-high 16 points), Dalton Knecht (12), R.J. Davis (11) and Jack LaRavia (10). Along with their 49 combined points, they accounted for 12 assists. Golden State’s POA defense so important because there is no Victor Wembanyama waiting at the rim. There is no Anthony Davis or Rudy Gobert or Chet Holmgren. Not even a Donovan Clingan The preseason is a time for experimenting, for seeing what might work and what shouldn’t even be tried. It’s a work in progress, and there is plenty of time to patch it. But the early returns are worth watching. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"}

The Warriors again play the Blazers in the preseason next Tuesday, as well as the third game of the 2025-26 NBA regular season in what will be the second night of a back-to-back. Here are three takeaways from the Warriors’ second win to start their five-game preseason schedule. After opening the preseason with a small-ball lineup in the Warriors' first game , coach Steve Kerr switched gears and went big against the Blazers. Al Horford moved into the starting lineup, with the real decision being Moses Moody staying and Brandin Podziemski coming off the bench. Horford and Moody accompanied Curry, Butler and Green. “Al gives us the ability to play bigger with shooting,” Kerr explained at his pregame press conference. “Portland’s got a pretty big team and I would anticipate they’ll start [Donovan] Clingan. I think I mentioned last game, I don’t want to throw Draymond out there constantly against these big centers. So this is a good night to take a look at that lineup and see what we do.” The Warriors trailed 18-15 when Kerr first turned to his bench, replacing Moody and Horford with Buddy Hield and Post with a little more than five minutes left in the first quarter. Moody blocked two shots in the first minute, and Horford already had two rebounds and one assist. He should have had two assists by then if Moody would have converted an open layup. But Horford’s first assist was an eye-opening dime. The 39-year-old center grabbed a defensive rebound and went coast-to-coast, finding Butler in transition for an easy layup at the rim. Al Horford doing this as a 39-year-old center is absurd pic.twitter.com/UCi79KK6Br The starters didn’t play together again all night. Like the preseason opener, Curry, Butler, Green and Horford all sat the second half. Horford was scoreless in 11 minutes while missing his four shot attempts. Moody didn’t start the second half and was a minus-10 in 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting. Once Kerr turned to his bench, the game flipped in favor of the Blazers. The Warriors used a 10-man rotation in the first quarter, using Podziemski, Hield, Post, Jonathan Kuminga and Gary Payton II off the bench. That unit lost its run 19-4 in the first quarter alone. The Blazers’ bench outscored the Warriors’ reserves 18-7 in the first quarter, and Portland went on a 13-0 run to hold a 14-point 39-25 lead going into the second quarter. By halftime, the Warriors were losing the bench battle 25-20. All of the Warriors’ bench players had a negative plus/minus, and Deni Avdija, who was up to 13 points, was the lone Blazers bench player in the negative. Seth Curry eventually will be an option off the bench for Kerr, and should at least provide more outside shooting. Curry “is still ramping up,” per Kerr, and has yet to play in the preseason. He will be waived by Oct. 18 and is eligible to be re-signed starting Nov. 11. Podziemski and Kuminga each were a game-low minus-17. If Toumani Camara starts making threes like he did against the Warriors, the rest of the league could have a problem on its hands. The Second Team All-Defensive selection from last season was part of the reason the Warriors were buried from long distance on their home court. Camara went 4 of 7 from 3-point range in the first half before missing his two attempts in the second half. Shaedon Sharpe also was 4 of 7 beyond the arc in the first half as the Blazers went 12 of 28 on threes through the first two quarters. The Warriors were losing the long distance battle, and were being beaten by speed. Most of the Blazers’ threes were open shots, and the Warriors were late to rotate. The Blazers shot 46.3 percent in the first half, including a 42.9 3-point percentage. The Warriors also only had two steals compared to six by the Blazers going into halftime, and they turned the ball over three times more than them – 12 to three. Effort and resiliency from the back of the bench deserves tons of positivity. First, the defensive miscues will have to be cleaned up ahead of Sunday’s game in LA against the Lakers.
