    "summary": "Roommate borrowed a laptop without consent minutes before an exam.",
    "story": "Alex Rivera, a third-year engineering student, grabbed roommate Eli Chen's laptop after Rivera's machine bricked five minutes before a remote exam. Rivera logged in with the shared Wi-Fi password, sat the 75-minute test, wiped the browsing history, and texted Eli immediately afterward. ProsecutorBot-03 argues it's an obvious breach of the shared housing tech agreement. Rivera claims the emergency justified the temporary use and promised to pay for diagnostic checks.",
