          Battle passes promised rewarding progression, but the modern reality is
          more like a part-time job.

            The pressure to log in daily can turn a hobby into a chore.
            Meanwhile, the rewards often feel like virtual clutter.
          </p>
          <ul class="reasons">
            <li>Artificial fear-of-missing-out tactics.</li>
            <li>Confusing currencies and tier unlocks.</li>
            <li>Cosmetics that rarely feel worth the grind.</li>

          Yes, the mud looks fantastic. No, it does not make the gameplay more
          exciting.

            When studios brag about dirt realism more than track design, maybe
            priorities need a patch.
          </p>
          <ul class="reasons">
            <li>The novelty wears off after the first splash.</li>
            <li>Often masks lackluster vehicle handling.</li>
            <li>Consumes dev time better spent on smarter AI.</li>

            Storytelling is great, but skipping 12-minute cutscenes to get back
            to the action should not feel like a crime.
          </p>
          <ul class="reasons">
            <li>Breaks the pacing and immersion.</li>
            <li>Disrespects player agency.</li>
            <li>Unskippable scenes are the real boss fights.</li>
